Case No.: 2222-0100
License No.: D44476

Dear Dr. Syme and Counsel:

On March 29, 2022, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2). On April 13,
2022, Dr. Syme was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing before
Disciplinary Panel A to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. Dr. Syme
attended the hearing on that date and was represented by counsel, Barry C. Goldstein, Esquire.
The State was represented by Robert J. Gilbert, Deputy Counsel, Administrative Prosecutor.
Both parties presented oral arguments at the post-deprivation hearing.

After consideration of the parties’ presentations, Disciplinary Panel A determined, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the health, safety, and welfare of the public imperatively
required the disciplinary panel to summarily suspend Dr. Syme’s license and there exists a
substantial risk of serious harm to the public health, safety, and welfare in Dr. Syme’s continued
practice. Disciplinary Panel A thus will not lift the summary suspension order, and the summary
suspension imposed on March 29, 2022 is reaffirmed and continues in effect. See COMAR
10.32.02.08H(1).

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, Dr. Syme has the right to request a full evidentiary hearing
before an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Administrative Hearings. This request will
be granted if the Board receives a written request for the hearing within TEN (10) days of the
date of this letter. Any request for a hearing should be sent to Christine A. Farrelly, Executive
Director, Maryland Board of Physicians, 4201 Patterson Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland 21215. If
Dr. Syme requests such a hearing, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set
the hearing to begin within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08I, though Dr. Syme
may waive that 30-day requirement.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel A resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely yours,

Signature On File

Christine A. Farrelly, Exec tive Director
Maryland State Board of Physicians
