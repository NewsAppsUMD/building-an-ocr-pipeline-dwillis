charge the Respondent with additional violations of the Order and the Act.

Prior to the issuance of an Order of Summary Suspension and amended
Violation, the Respondent agreed to enter into the following Consent Order, consisting
of Procedural Background, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order, Consent and
Notary.

FINDINGS OF FACT

Disciplinary Panel B makes the following Findings of Fact:

1. The Respondent was originally licensed to practice as a physician
assistant in Maryland on January 2, 2014, under License Number C05296. The
Respondent's latest license was given the expiration date of June 30, 2019.

2. The Board initiated an investigation of the Respondent under Case
Number 2015-0771B after receiving a Mandated 10-Day Report, dated April 27, 2015,
from a health care facility (the “Facility’)' that is located in Maryland. The Facility
reported that it investigated the Respondent's workplace actions and determined that
she “was writing prescriptions for herself and was using another provider's log on to
write additional prescriptions for herself.” The Facility reported that after conducting its
investigation, it terminated her employment, effective April 27, 2015, and terminated her
privileges at the Facility and at another affiliated health care facility.

3. The Facility submitted a follow-up report, dated April 30, 2015, in which it
reported that it performed a drug test on the Respondent prior to her termination, which
was “positive.”

‘ For confidentiality reasons, the names of health care facilities will not be disclosed in this document.
The Respondent is aware of all health care facilities referenced herein.

3
4. After considering this information, Panel B issued an Order for Summary
Suspension, dated August 11, 2015, in which it summarily suspended the Respondent's
physician assistant’s license pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov't Il § 10-226(c)(2),
concluding that the public health, safety or welfare imperatively required emergency

action.

5. On August 11, 2015, Panel B issued disciplinary charges against the
Respondent under Case Number 2015-0771B, alleging, inter alia, that

the Respondent, while working in her capacity as a physician
assistant at [the Facility], electronically wrote approximately 17
prescriptions in the names of various staff providers at [the Facility]
for Percocet 5/APAP 325 mg (an opioid medication and Schedule II
controlled dangerous substance), without their authorization,
permission or consent, and filled the prescriptions at area
pharmacies. The Respondent wrote the prescriptions, which were
typically for 60 pills each, at approximately two-week intervals, from
October 2014, to April 2015. The Respondent was not a patient or
under the care of any of the providers in whose names she wrote
the prescriptions.

6. Panel B’s disciplinary charges alleged that the Respondent's actions
constituted violations of the following provisions of the Act under Health Occ. Il § 15-
314 (a):

(2)  Fraudulently or deceptively uses a license;

(3) Is guilty of: (ii) unprofessional conduct in the practice of
medicine;

(8) ls addicted to, or habitually abuses, any narcotic or
controlled dangerous substance as defined in § 5-101 of the
Criminal Law Article; [and]

(11) Willfully makes or files a false report or record in the practice
of medicine[.]
7. On August 26, 2015, Panel B conducted a show cause hearing in which it
permitted the Respondent to show cause as to why the suspension it issued in its Order
for Summary Suspension should not be continued. After hearing arguments from the
parties, the Board continued the summary suspension of her license.

8. The Respondent resolved Panel B’s disciplinary charges through a
Consent Order, dated December 3, 2015. In the Consent Order, Panel B found that the
Respondent violated the following provisions of the Act under Health Occ. Il § 15-
314(a): (2), Fraudulently or deceptively uses a license; (3), Is guilty of: (ii)
Unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine; (8), Is addicted to, or habitually
abuses, any narcotic or controlled dangerous substance as defined in § 5-101 of the
Criminal Law Article; and (11), Willfully makes or files a false report or record in the
practice of medicine.

9. Pursuant to the Consent Order, Panel B terminated the Order for
Summary Suspension, dated August 11, 2015, and suspended the Respondent's
physician assistant's license until April 1, 2016, subject to certain conditions, including
but not limited to, her enrollment in the MPRP. Panel B also ordered that after the
conclusion of the suspension, it would place her on probation for five years, subject to a
series of probationary terms and conditions.

10. On April 1, 2016, Panel B issued the Order, in which it terminated the
suspension it imposed under its December 3, 2015, Consent Order. Panel B placed the
Respondent on probation for five years, subject to a series of probationary terms and
conditions, which included the following:

the terms and conditions of any Rehabilitation Agreement(s) and

Respondent tested positive for another substance that was prohibited under the express
terms of the Order and the PRA. The Respondent denied the use of the substance.

13. After receiving these findings, the State issued the Violation, alleging that
the Respondent violated the Order when she tested positive for a substance that was
prohibited under the express terms of the Order and PRA on or about August 28, 2017,
in violation of Conditions Two (2), Three (3) and Five (5) of the Order. The charges also
alleged that the Respondent's positive test finding constituted a violation of the following
provision of the Act under Health Occ. Il § 15-314(a): (3) Is guilty of: (ii) Unprofessional
conduct in the practice of medicine.

14. While the above charges were pending, the Respondent underwent
additional toxicology screening pursuant to her PRA. In a toxicology test taken on
November 13, 2017, the Respondent tested positive for another substance prohibited
under the express terms of the Order and PRA. The Respondent also admitted to
ingesting substances that violated the express terms of the Order and the PRA.

15. Based on the above findings, Panel B voted to amend the Violation to
reflect the positive toxicology report referenced in J 14, supra.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Based on the foregoing facts, Disciplinary Panel B concludes that the public
health, safety or welfare imperatively require emergency action in this case, pursuant to
Md. Code Ann., State Gov't § 10-226 (c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2016 Supp.).

Panel B also concludes as a matter of law that the Respondent violated

Probationary Conditions Two (2), Five (5) and Six (6) of the Order Terminating
Suspension and Imposing Probation dated April 1, 2016; and with violating the following
provision of the Maryland Physician Assistants Act: Health Occ. Il § 15-314(a)(3), Is
guilty of: (ii) Unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine.
