Dear Dr. Doh and Mr. Malizio:

On May 26, 2020, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued
an ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE in
this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl. Vol.). On June
10, 2020, Dr. Doh was given an opportunity to attend a hearing before Disciplinary Panel A to
show cause why that suspension should not be continued. Dr. Doh attended the hearing on that
date with counsel. The State was represented by Adam Malizio, Assistant Attorney General,
Administrative Prosecutor. At the post-deprivation hearing counsel for Dr. Doh stated that Dr.
Doh consented to the continuation of the summary suspension. Accordingly, the parties did not
present any arguments.

Disciplinary Panel A, having considered the investigative information in this case,
continues to believe that the public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires the summary
suspension of Dr. Doh’s medical license with the meaning of Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-
226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl. Vol.). Disciplinary Panel A thus will not lift the summary suspension
order and the summary suspension imposed on May 26, 2020 is affirmed and continues. See
COMAR 10.32.02.08H(1).

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, Dr. Doh has the right to request a full evidentiary hearing
before an Administrative Law Judge at the Office of Administrative Hearings. This request will
be granted if the Board receives a written request for the hearing within TEN (10) days of the
date of this letter. Any request for a hearing should be sent to Christine A. Farrelly, Executive
Director, at the Board’s address. If Dr. Doh requests such a hearing, the regulations require that
an Administrative Law Judge set the hearing to begin within 30 days of the request, see COMAR
10.32.02.081, though Dr. Doh may waive that 30-day requirement.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel A resulting from

formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely yours,

Signature on File
