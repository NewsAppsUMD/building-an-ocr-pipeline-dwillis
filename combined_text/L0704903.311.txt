INVESTIGATIVE FINDINGS

Based on information received by, and made known to Panel A, and the
investigatory information obtained by, received by and made known to and available to
Panel A, including the instances described below, Panel A has reason to believe that the

following facts are true:!

' The statements regarding the Respondent’s conduct are intended to provide the Respondent with
reasonable notice of the asserted facts. They are not intended as, and do not necessarily represent a complete
description of the evidence, either documentary or testimonial, to be offered against the Respondent in
connection with this matter.
1. The Respondent was originally issued a license to practice respiratory care
in Maryland on July 2, 2019, under License Number L07049. The Respondent’s latest
license was given the expiration date of May 30, 2022.

2. At all times relevant hereto, the Respondent practiced as a respiratory care
practitioner at a health care facility (the “Facility”)’ located in Baltimore County,
Maryland.

3. The Board initiated an investigation of the Respondent on February 3, 2021,
after receiving a Mandated 10-Day Report (the “Report’”’) from the Facility. The Facility
reported that it placed the Respondent on a leave of absence after she was found asleep
while on duty. The Facility stated that on January 22, 2021, two supervisory Facility staff
persons (the Supervisor and Director) found the Respondent in the break room asleep with
her head down. They called out her name multiple times before they were able to wake
her up. The Respondent disclosed to the Director that she had been up all night and had
used an illicit controlled dangerous substance (“CDS”).> Facility staff then escorted the

evaluation, after which the Respondent was sent home pending the results of testing. The
Facility received the test findings on February 2, 2021, which it attached to the Report.‘

4, By letter dated February 19, 2021, the Board informed the Respondent that
it was in receipt of the Facility’s Report and that it had opened an investigation on her as a
result. The Board directed the Respondent to provide a response to the Report on or before
February 26, 2021.

5. By letter dated March 1, 2021, the Respondent submitted a written response
to the Board in which she stated that due to increased stressors in her life, she became
“easily influenced by a negative person in [her] life” and has since asked the Facility for
assistance for her medical condition.

6. Board staff interviewed the Facility staff persons who supervised the
Respondent at the Facility. Those individuals confirmed that they encountered the
Respondent on January 22, 2021 and observed her sleeping in a break room while on duty.
The Director confirmed that the Respondent made disclosures to her about her use of an
illicit CDS and was “remorseful” and “embarrassed,” after which she sent the Respondent
to the Facility’s Occupational Health department. Board staff confirmed during these
interviews that on January 22, 2021, the Respondent had been seeing patients during her

shift.

4 For confidentiality reasons, the test findings will not be identified in this document. The Board was aware
of the specific test findings and Panel A was aware of the findings at the time it voted to summarily suspend
the Respondent’s license.
7. Board staff also reviewed Facility records which noted that in November
2019, the Facility sent the Respondent to its Occupational Health department for sleeping
while on duty, during which time the Respondent disclosed that she was with an individual
who was using an illicit CDS. Facility records state that the Respondent was working on
January 22, 2021, the day she was relieved from duty. The records also state that the
Respondent admitted to using illicit CDS since September 2020 and “had an all nightery
(sic) on Wednesday.”

8, On March 17, 2021, Board staff conducted an under-oath interview of the
Respondent. During the interview, the Respondent stated that she began using an illicit
CDS in or around September 2020, and that by the end of December 2020/beginning of
January 2021, was using this illicit CDS on a daily basis. The Respondent stated that she
missed one day of work in January 2021 due to her illicit CDS use. With respect to the
incident that occurred on January 22, 2021, the Respondent stated that she used the illicit
CDS during the early morning hours of January 21, 2021, which caused her to have an “all
nighter.” The Respondent confirmed that she used the illicit CDS the night before her shift
on January 22, 2021 and was found asleep by Facility staff in the break room. The
Respondent stated that she continued to use the illicit CDS until February 3 or 4, 2021,

when she left for treatment.
