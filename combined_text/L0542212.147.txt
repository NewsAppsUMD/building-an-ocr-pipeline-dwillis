Re: Surrender of License to Practice Medicine
License Number: L05422
Case Number: 7717-0055

Dear Dr. Bhandari and Members of the Disciplinary Panel A,

Please be advised that I have decided to SURRENDER my license to practice
respiratory care in the State of Maryland, License Number L05422, effective
immediately. I understand that upon surrender of my license, I may not, with or without
compensation, practice respiratory care in the State of Maryland as it is defined in the
Maryland Respiratory Care Act (the “Act’””), Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. §§ 14-5A-01(h)
(2014 Repl. Vol.). In other words, as of the effective date of this Letter of Surrender, I
understand that the surrender of my license means that I am in the same position as an
unlicensed individual in the State of Maryland.

I understand that this Letter of Surrender is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT, and upon
Disciplinary Panel A’s (“Panel A”) acceptance, becomes a FINAL ORDER of Panel A
of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”’).

I acknowledge that the Board received information from the Maryland
Professional Rehabilitation Program that I had failed to comply with my participant
rehabilitation plan and, therefore, was discharged for cause, in violation of the Consent
Order dated December 20, 2016 (attached as Exhibit A). I have decided to surrender my
license to practice respiratory care in the State of Maryland to avoid further investigation
and prosecution of these allegations. I recognize that for all purposes relevant to my
respiratory care license that these allegations shall be treated as proven and that these
allegations support a conclusion that I violated the Consent Order dated December 20,
2016.

I wish to make it clear that I have voluntarily, knowingly and freely chosen to
submit this Letter of Surrender to avoid the issuance of charges and prosecution of the
aforementioned allegations. I do not wish to contest these allegations. I understand that
by executing this Letter of Surrender I am waiving my right to contest any charges that

would issue from Panel A’s investigative findings in a formal evidentiary hearing at
which I would have had the right to counsel, to confront witnesses, to give testimony, to
call witnesses on my own behalf and all other substantive and procedural protections
provided by law, including the right to appeal to circuit court.

I understand that the Board will advise the Federation of State Medical Boards,
the National Practitioner Data Bank, and the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data
Bank of this Letter of Surrender, and in response to any inquiry, that I have surrendered
my license as if it were revoked. I also understand that in the event I would apply for
licensure in any form in any other state or jurisdiction that this Letter of Surrender may
be released or published by the Board to the same extent as a final order that would result
from disciplinary action, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Gen. Prov. §§ 4-101 et seq. (2014),
and that this Letter of Surrender constitutes a disciplinary action by Panel A.

I affirm that as of the date of this Letter of Surrender, I will present to the Board
my original Maryland respiratory care license, number L05422, any renewal wallet cards,
and wall certificate.

I further recognize and agree that by submitting this Letter of Surrender, my
license will remain surrendered for a minimum period of one (1) year, and unless and
until the Board grants reinstatement. In the event that I apply for reinstatement of my
Maryland License, I understand that Panel A or its successor is not required to grant
reinstatement; and, if it does grant reinstatement, may impose any terms and conditions
the disciplinary panel considers appropriate for public safety and the protection of the
integrity and reputation of the profession. I further understand that if I ever file a petition
for reinstatement, I will approach Panel A or its successor in the same position as an
individual whose license has been revoked. I also understand that if I apply for
reinstatement, I bear the burden of demonstrating my professional competence and fitness
to practice respiratory care to the satisfaction of Panel A or its successor.

I acknowledge that I may not rescind this Letter of Surrender in part or in its
entirety for any reason whatsoever. Finally, I wish to make clear that I have been advised
of my right to be represented by an attorney of my choice throughout proceedings before
Panel A, including the right to counsel with an attorney prior to signing this Letter of
Surrender. I have knowingly and willfully waived my right to be represented by an
attorney before signing this letter surrendering my license to practice respiratory care in
Maryland. I understand both the nature of Panel A’s actions and this Letter of Surrender
fully. I acknowledge that I understand and comprehend the language, meaning and terms
and effect of this Letter of Surrender. I make this decision knowingly and voluntarily.

BACKGROUND
1. At all times relevant, the Respondent was licensed to practice as a respiratory

care practitioner (“RCP”) in the State of Maryland. The Respondent was initially
licensed in Maryland on or about July 2, 2010.

2. On October 18, 2016, Disciplinary Panel A summarily suspended the
Respondent's license to practice as an RCP based on investigative findings that the

the Beard’s Order for Summary Suspension was based on the Board's investigation of

"the complaint set forth below. '

‘ On November 2, 2016, following a post-deprivation hearing, Disciplinary Panel A continued the

patch. She was not being prescribed the fentanyl any longer, but used a patch she had
“from a previous prescription, and reportedly had removed it before reporting for work.
