Case No.: 2221-0011A
License No.: D88339

Dear Dr. Freyer and Counsel:

On October 26, 2020, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl.
Vol. and 2019 Supp.). Dr. Freyer was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing
before Disciplinary Panel A on November 4, 2020, to show cause why that suspension should not
be continued. Dr. Freyer attended the hearing on that date together with his counsel, Natasha
Wesker, Esq. The State was represented by Nicholas Johansson, Assistant Attorney General,
Administrative Prosecutor. Both parties presented oral arguments at the post-deprivation hearing.

After consideration of the presentations of the parties, Disciplinary Panel A determined
that it would continue the summary suspension imposed on October 26, 2020. Disciplinary Panel
A thus will not lift the order of summary suspension. Disciplinary Panel A finds that the public
health, safety, and welfare imperatively requires the summary suspension of Dr. Freyer’s license
to practice medicine. See State Gov't § 10-226(c)(2)(i). The order of summary suspension is thus
reaffirmed and continues in effect. See COMAR 10.32.02.08H(1).

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, Dr. Freyer has the right to request a full evidentiary hearing
before an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Administrative Hearings. This request will
be granted if the Board receives a written request for the hearing within TEN (10) days of the date
of this letter. Any request for a hearing should be sent to Christine A. Farrelly, Executive Director,
Maryland Board of Physicians, 4201 Patterson Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland 21215. If such a
hearing is requested, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set the hearing to
begin within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08I, though that 30-day requirement
may be waived.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel A resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely yours,

Signature on File

Christine A. Farrelly, Fxecutive Director U
Maryland State Board of Physicians
