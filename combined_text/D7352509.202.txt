FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
PROCEDURAL HISTORY

Ravi Murali, M.D., was originally licensed to practice medicine in the State of
Maryland on January 10, 2012, under license number D73525. On March 10, 2021, in the
United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, Dr. Murali pled guilty to
one count of Healthcare Fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1347. On November 22, 2021, Dr.
Murali was sentenced to 54 months in prison to commence on his reporting date of January 10,
2022, followed by three years of supervised probation and restitution in the amount of
$291,480.00.

On October 14, 2021, the Office of the Attorney General filed with the Maryland Board
of Physicians (the “Board”) a petition to suspend Dr. Murali’s license to practice medicine and a
proposed show cause order pursuant to section 14-404(b)(1) of the Maryland Medical Practice
Act. The Board did not receive a response from Dr. Murali. On January 10, 2022, Panel A
issued an Order suspending the license of Dr. Murali pursuant to Health Occ. § 14-404(b)(1).!

On July 22, 2022, the Office of the Attorney General filed with the Board a petition to
revoke Dr. Murali’s license to practice medicine and a proposed show cause order pursuant to

section 14-404(b)(2) of the Maryland Medical Practice Act. The statute provides:

' At the time the Petition was filed in this case, Dr. Murali had not yet been sentenced. Accordingly, a Petition to
suspend Dr. Murali’s license was filed pursuant to Health Occ. § 14-404(b)(1) instead of a petition to revoke
pursuant to Health Occ. § 14-404(b)(2), which is now warranted after the completion of sentencing.
(2) After completion of the appellate process if the conviction has not
been reversed or the plea set aside with respect to a crime involving moral
turpitude, a disciplinary panel shall order the revocation of a license on the
certification by the Office of the Attorney General.

Md. Code Ann., Health Occupations Article (“Health Occ.”) § 14-404(b) (2021 Repl.

Vol.). Attached to the Petition were certified copies of the indictment, docket entries, transcript

of the plea agreement proceedings, judgment, and transcript of the sentencing proceedings. Dr.

Murali was ordered by the Board to show cause in writing, on or before August 29, 2022, if there

was any reason why his license should not be revoked. The Board did not receive a response

from Dr. Murali. Having reviewed and considered the entire record in this case, Panel A issues

this Final Decision and Order. COMAR 10.32.02.07H(1).

FINDINGS OF FACT

Panel A finds the following:

1. On March 10, 2021, Dr. Murali pled guilty to one count of Healthcare Fraud, in violation
of 18 U.S.C. § 13472

2, During the guilty plea hearing, the following discussion was held between Dr. Murali and.
the Court:

Court: What did you do that led to your being charged here with Medicare Fraud?

Dr. Murali: I prescribed the braces, without following procedure of examining and calling the
patients, that led to unnecessary Medicare billing.

Court: Okay. In fact, not just unnecessary, but you knew that it was actually deceptive
and fraudulent; is that correct?

Dr. Murali: Yes.

? 18 U.S.C. § 1347 states:

Whoever knowingly and willfully executes, or attempts to execute, a scheme or artifice—

(1)to defraud any health care benefit program; or

(2)to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the
money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any health care benefit program,
in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items, or services, shall be
fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.

2
Court:

Okay. And so you didn’t follow procedure, is one way of putting it, but also you
knew that you were not complying with the regulations that pertained to
prescribing the durable medical equipment; is that correct?

Dr. Murali: | Yes, Your Honor.

Court: And you did this - - What was the purpose in your doing that?

Dr. Murali: I was just trying to make - - trying to get by.

Court: In terms of financially, you mean? You did it to make money; is that correct?

Dr. Murali: Yes, Your Honor.

3. The Judge found that there was a factual basis for the guilty plea and that Dr. Murali

entered the plea of guilty knowingly and voluntarily, and, accordingly, found Dr. Murali
guilty of Healthcare Fraud.

4. On November 22, 2021, Dr. Murali was sentenced to 54 months in prison to commence
on his reporting date of January 10, 2022, followed by three years of supervised
probation and restitution in the amount of $291,480.00.

5. On January 10, 2022, Panel A issued a final decision and order suspending Dr. Murali’s
license to practice medicine pursuant to Health Occ. § 14-404(b)(1).

6. The time for filing an appeal has passed and the conviction has not been reversed and the
guilty plea has not been set aside.

DISCUSSION

Section 14-404(b)(2) of the Health Occupations Article provides: “After completion of

the appellate process if the conviction has not been reversed or the plea has not been set aside

with respect to a crime involving moral turpitude, a disciplinary panel shall order the revocation

of a license on the certification by the Office of the Attorney General.” In the final decision and

order issued on January 10, 2022, Panel A determined that Dr. Murali’s conviction and guilty

plea to health care fraud is a crime involving moral turpitude and suspended Dr. Murali’s license

to practice medicine. The relevant portion of the discussion section from the January 10, 2022

order is as follows:
Under Health Occ. §14-404(b)(1), a disciplinary panel has the obligation
and discretion to determine what types of crimes are crimes involving moral
turpitude for licensing and disciplinary purposes. “The term moral turpitude has
been defined generally as importing an act of baseness, vileness or depravity in
the private and social duties which a man owes to his fellow men, or to society in
general, contrary to the accepted and customary rule of right and duty between
man and man.” Attorney Grievance Comm’n of Md. v. Walman, 280 Md. 453,
459 (1977) (internal quotation marks omitted), “{I]t is settled that whatever else
[moral turpitude] may mean . . . a crime in which an intent to defraud is an
essential element is a crime involving moral turpitude. It is also settled that the
related group of offenses involving intentional dishonesty for purposes of
personal gain are crimes involving moral turpitude[.]” Jd at 459-60. “[I]n the
context of a licensing board’s review of the conduct of its licensee, the concept of
moral turpitude is rather broad.” Oltman v. Maryland State Bd. Of Physicians,
162 Md. App. 457, 483 (2005).

The statutory text is clear that fraud is an essential element of the crime
that Dr. Murali pled guilty to. Healthcare fraud includes the knowing and willful
execution of a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or to obtain
money or property of any health care benefit program by false or fraudulent
pretenses. 18 U.S.C. § 1347 (emphasis added).

In addition to the elements of the crime, Dr. Murali’s admissions to the
Court also establish that Dr. Murali’s crime involved moral turpitude. Dr. Murali
admitted to defrauding the Medicare program by knowingly prescribing durable
medical equipment without following the required regulations for purposes of his
own personal financial gain. Walman, 280 Md. at 459-60. Therefore, the facts of

this case also establish that Dr. Murali pled guilty to a crime involving moral
turpitude.

The appellate process is now complete and Dr. Murali’s conviction and guilty plea have
not been set aside, as a result, Panel A is now required to order the revocation of Dr. Murali’s
license to practice medicine pursuant to section 14-404(b)(2) of the Health Occupations Article.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

In the January 10, 2022 final decision and order, Panel A concluded that Dr. Murali pled
guilty to a crime involving moral turpitude. Pursuant to section 14-404(b)(2) of the Health
Occupations Article, upon the completion of the appellate proceedings, Panel A is now required

to order the revocation of Dr. Murali’s license to practice medicine.
