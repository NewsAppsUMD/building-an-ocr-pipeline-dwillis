On or about December 10, 2018, the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”)
received a written request from the Baltimore City Office of the Child Support Enforcement
Administration of the Maryland Department of Human Resources (the “Administration’”) to
suspend the physician’s assistant license held by Fahim Nadir Kashif, PA-C, (the “Respondent”),
License No. C03457, for delinquent child support. This action was to be taken by authority of
Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law § 10-119.3 (2012 Repl. Vol.), which provides, in pertinent part:

(e)(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, upon

(k) Reinstatement of license—Duty of licensing authority. — A
licensing authority shall immediately reinstate any license

suspended, or process an application for any license denied, under
this section if:

reinstated; and
(2) the individual otherwise qualifies for the license.

On December 20, 2018, the Board sent an unexecuted copy of this Order of Suspension
to the Respondent’s last known address of record with the Board and also to the address on the
request form that the Board received from the Administration. Accompanying the unexecuted
Order of Suspension was a cover letter notifying the Respondent of his right to contest his
identity in writing within thirty days of the date of the letter and notifying the Respondent that if
he did not submit a signed, written appeal to the Board on or before January 19, 2019, the Board
would execute this Order of Suspension as written. The Respondent did not submit a written
contest of identity to the Board by January 19, 2019.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1, The Board issued a license to practice medicine to the Respondent on November

29, 2006. His license is currently active and is scheduled to expire on June 30, 2019.
2. On or about December 10, 2018, the Board received a written request from the
Administration, entitled “Request to Suspend or Deny License for Delinquent Child Support”
(the “Request”), which requested that the Board suspend the physician’s assistant license held by
the Respondent for delinquent child support under the authority of Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law §
‘10-119.3. The Request stated that, as of December 1, 2018, the arrearage amount of child
support that the Respondent owed was $12,402.01, in the Administration’s case numbered
300119237.

3. As noted above, Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law § 10-119.3(e)(2) & (h)(1) requires
that the Board suspend the license of the Respondent upon notification by the Administration and
after sending written notice to the Respondent of the proposed suspension of his license and of
his right “to contest the identity of the individual whose license . . . is to be suspended.”

4. On December 20, 2018, the Board sent an unexecuted copy of this Order of
Suspension to the Respondent’s last known address registered with the Board (the same address
as that on the Request). Included with the unexecuted Order of Suspension was a letter notifying
the Respondent of his right to contest his identity, in writing to the Board, within thirty days of
the date of the letter; that is, to contest that he was not the Fahim Nadir Kashif, PA-C, C03457
named by the Administration as the individual whose license should be suspended for delinquent
child support. In addition, the letter also gave Respondent written notice that if he did not submit
to the Board a signed, written appeal on or before January 19, 2019, the Board would execute

this Order of Suspension as written.2

2 The letter also notified the Respondent that he could prevent the suspension of his registration by contacting the
Administration and arranging to pay the arrears in full within 15 days of the date of the letter.
5. The Respondent did not submit a written contest of identity to the Board by
January 19, 2019; nor was the Board notified that the Respondent arranged to pay the arrears in
full.

6. Having given the Respondent the statutorily required written notice of the Board’s
intent to suspend his license and of his right to contest identity pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Fam.
Law § 10-119.3(h)(1), and having not received a written response or appeal from the
Respondent, the Board is statutorily required to suspend the Respondent’s license, pursuant to
Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law § 10-119.3(e)(2).

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, the Board concludes that, pursuant to Md. Code
Ann., Fam. Law § 10-119.3(e)(2)(i), it is statutorily required to suspend the Respondent’s
license to practice medicine until the Board receives notification from the Administration that the
Respondent’s license should be reinstated pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law § 10-
119.3¢k)(1)-(2), provided that the Respondent is otherwise qualified for a license.

ORDER

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, it is hereby:

ORDERED that the physician assistant license held by the Respondent, Fahim Nadir
Kashif, PA-C, C03457, is SUSPENDED; and it is further,

Human Resources that the Respondent’s license should be reinstated pursuant to Md. Code Ann.,
Fam. Law § 10-119.3(k)(1)-(2), provided that the Respondent is otherwise qualified for a license;

and it is further,
ORDERED that this is a Final Order of the Maryland State Board of Physicians and, as
such, is a public document and is reportable to any entity to which the Board is obligated by law

to report, and is disclosable pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Gen. Prov. §§4-101 through 4-601
