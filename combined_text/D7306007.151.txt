Re: Christian Millett, M.D.
Case No.: 2221-0084
License No.: D73060

Dear Dr. Millett and Counsel:

On June 30, 2021, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued
an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE
in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2). On July 14, 2021, Dr.
Millett was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing before Disciplinary Panel
A to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. Dr. Millett attended the hearing
on that date and was represented by counsel, Tamara Miller, Esquire. The State was represented
by Michael Brown, Assistant Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor. Both parties
presented oral arguments at the post-deprivation hearing,

After considerations of the parties’ presentations, Disciplinary Panel A determined, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the health, welfare, and safety of the public imperatively
required the disciplinary panel to summarily suspend Dr. Millett’s license and that there exists a
substantial risk of serious harm to the public health, safety or welfare in Dr. Millett’s continued
practice. Disciplinary Panel A thus will not lift the summary suspension order and the summary
suspension imposed on June 30, 2021, is reaffirmed and continues. See COMAR
10.32.02.08H(1).

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, Dr. Millett has the right to request a full evidentiary hearing
before an Administrative Law Judge at the Office of Administrative Hearings. This request will
be granted if the Board receives a written request for the hearing within TEN (10) days of the
date of this letter. Any request for a hearing should be sent to Christine A. Farrelly, Executive
Director, at the Board’s address. If Dr. Millett requests such a hearing, the regulations require
that an Administrative Law Judge set the hearing to begin within 30 days of the request, see
COMAR 10.32.02.08I, though Dr. Millett may waive that 30-day requirement.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel A resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely,

Signature on File

Ellen Douglas Smith, Deputy Director
Maryland State Board of Physicians
