Re: Ahmad O. Aljamal,
Case No.: 2224-0016A
License No.: D97464

Dear Dr. Aljamal and Counsel:

On October 18, 2023, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2) (2022 Repl.
Vol.). On October 31, 2023, Dr. Aljamal was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation
hearing before Disciplinary Panel A to show cause why that suspension should not be continued.
Prior to the scheduled hearing, Dr. Aljamal’s counsel informed the Board that Dr. Aljamal had
decided to waive his right to the post-deprivation hearing and to consent to a continuation of the
summary suspension. Due to the waiver, Panel A did not hold a post-deprivation hearing in this
matter, the summary suspension continues, and the parties may proceed to the summary suspension
appeal if Dr. Aljamal requests an evidentiary hearing as referenced below. COMAR 10.32.02.08E.

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, Dr. Aljamal has the right to request a full evidentiary hearing
before an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Administrative Hearings. This request will
be granted if the Board receives a written request for the hearing within TEN (10) days of the date
of this letter. Any request for a hearing should be sent to Christine A. Farrelly, Executive Director,

4201 Patterson Avenue - Baltimore, Maryland 21215

Maryland Board of Physicians, 4201 Patterson Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland 21215. If such a
hearing is requested, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set the hearing to

begin within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.081, though the 30-day requirement
may be waived.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel A resulting from

formal disciplinary action and is, therefore a public document.

Sincerely,
