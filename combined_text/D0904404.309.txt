ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE

 

Disciplinary Panel A (“Panel A”) of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the
“Board”) hereby SUMMARILY SUSPENDS Glenn D. Legler, Sr. M.D.’s (the
“Respondent”) license to practice medicine in the State of Maryland, License Number
D09044.

Panel A takes such action pursuant to its authority under Md. Code Ann., State
Gov’t ("State Gov’t") § 10-226(c)(2) (2014 Repl. Vol. and 2018 Supp.), concluding that
the public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires emergency action. Panel A
bases its conclusion on the following investigative findings.

INVESTIGATIVE FINDINGS’

Panel A has obtained investigatory information that Respondent’s continued

practice of medicine poses a substantial likelihood or risk of serious harm to public health

safety and welfare as evidenced by:

' The statements regarding Respondent’s conduct are intended to provide Respondent with notice of the
basis of the suspension. They are not intended as, and do not necessarily represent a complete description
of the evidence, either documentary or testimonial, to be offered against Respondent regarding this
matter.
1. His telephonic communications with Board staff which raised significant
concerns regarding the effect of his physical mobility limitations on his
ability to practice medicine in a safe and competent manner;

2. His responses in an interview with Board staff which raised significant
concerns regarding his ability to concentrate on the topics discussed;

3. The physical condition of his home office and the lack of a readily
accessible computer and patient medical records;

4, His prescribing controlled dangerous substances (“CDS”) for patients who
are geographically distant from his office, including patients who are out-
of-state;

5. His prescribing CDS for himself and a family member, Family Member A’,
and

6. His failure to submit to an appropriate examination on three occasions as
directed by the Board, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 14-402.

The Board opened this case in November 2018 based on a complaint from a
Corporal with the St. Mary’s County Sheriff’s Office (the “Corporal”). A pharmacist in
St. Mary’s County, in Southern Maryland, called the Corporal because a patient with a St.
Mary’s County address presented a prescription for CDS which had been written by
Respondent whose practice is located in Montgomery County, Maryland.

The Board’s investigation revealed that Respondent, a psychiatrist, predominately
treats individuals with drug addiction and dependence in his home office where there is
no professional staff or other individuals present. The office is located on the lower level
of the home, which is not readily accessible to other individuals who may be present in

the home. Respondent has been experiencing mobility issues for several years. He uses a

> Health Occ. § 14-402 authorizes the Board when investigating an allegation against a licensee to direct
the licensee to a health professional program to submit to an appropriate examination.

20. On April 3, 2018, at 6:25 p.m., Respondent left a telephone message with
Board staff, stating he requires a full-time assistant, due to a recent fall and that he was
unable to locate transportation. Respondent did not appear for the second scheduled
evaluation.

21. On April 5, 2019, Board staff sent correspondence to Respondent by
electronic mail and overnight delivery, directing him to appear at MPRP on Tuesday,
April 9 at 1:00 p.m. for an intake evaluation. Respondent was advised that his
unreasonable failure or refusal to submit to an examination is prima facie evidence of a
licensed medical practitioner’s inability to practice medicine.

22. On April 8, 2019, Respondent left a telephone message with Board staff,
stating “I need an attendant to accompany me due to my ambulation problems...it’s
_ beyond my control now...my housekeeper does not feel comfortable driving me to
Baltimore.” Respondent did not appear for the third scheduled evaluation.

23. On April 9, 2019, Respondent left two telephone messages with Board
staff, stating the reason he fell the night before was “the bed is too high for my physical
limitation” and that he was “up most of the night because he fell twice and had to have
the rescue squad come.”

CONCLUSION OF LAW.

Based upon the foregoing Investigative Findings, the Board concludes that the
public health, safety, or welfare imperatively requires emergency action, and that
pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2), Respondent's license must be

immediately suspended.

In addition, after Board staff conducted a site visit to Respondent’s home office
and interviewed Respondent in March 2019, the focus of the investigation became
Respondent’s competence and potential danger to the public. The Board, however, has
been unable to obtain an assessment of Respondent’s competence since Respondent has
failed to keep three appointments for an intake evaluation and referral for an appropriate
examination.

Based on the investigatory information obtained by Panel A as summarized
above, and the specific instances described below, Panel A has reason to believe that the
following facts are true and that there is a substantial likelihood of a risk of serious harm
to the public health, safety, or welfare by Respondent.

IL Background of License

1. At all times relevant hereto, Respondent was licensed to practice medicine
in Maryland. Respondent was originally licensed to practice medicine in Maryland on
February 19, 1960. On or about September 26, 2018, Respondent last renewed his
license, which will expire on September 30, 2020.

2. Since 1962, Respondent had also maintained a license to practice medicine
in the District of Columbia (“DC”); however, the license expired on December 31, 2018.

3. Respondent graduated from medical school in 1958. He received post-

graduate training in internal medicine and psychiatry. Respondent also received
psychoanalytic training. Respondent is not, and has never been, board-certified in any
practice areas.

4, Since 1962, Respondent’s practice has included the private practice of
general psychiatry in DC and Maryland, and employment at a forensic psychiatric
hospital in DC and at a drug treatment clinic in Baltimore. Respondent is certified to
prescribe Buprenorphine (Suboxone). Approximately two years ago, Respondent moved
his practice from DC to his home in Montgomery County, Maryland because of his
difficulty in getting to the DC office. Respondent employs an individual to assist with
filing, approximately once a week; however, the individual has not been available for
several weeks.

5. Respondent has an active DEA registration. Respondent’s most recent
Controlled Dangerous Substances Registration in Maryland was issued on October 19,
2017 and expired on March 31, 2019.

IL. Complaint

6. On November 14, 2018, the Board received a complaint from the Corporal,
stating that he had received a report of concern from a pharmacy in St. Mary’s County
regarding a prescription from Respondent which was written in Bethesda, Maryland.’
The Corporal called Respondent at the telephone number which was on the prescription
and received a voice message which stated, “missed your call, will get back to you.”

Later Respondent called the Corporal at 11:00 p.m. and stated that the individual was his

patient, but he did not remember the prescription. The Corporal reported that he thought
Respondent sounded “intoxicated.”
Il. Initial Investigation

7. On December 14, 2018, pursuant to a subpoena, the Board received a
computer print-out from the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (“PDMP”) of all
CDS written by Respondent from January 1, 2017 to December 5, 2018, documenting
Respondent’s prescribing of CDS medications to multiple patients. Based on an updated
PDMP report obtained on March 12, 2019, the Board subsequently obtained hard copies
of prescriptions from an area pharmacy confirming that Respondent has prescribed
Schedule IV CDS to himself and to Family Member A from approximately January 2017
through March 12, 2018.

8. On February 13, 2019, Board staff received the police report from St.
Mary’s County Sheriffs Office which documents that on September 18, 2018, they
conducted an investigation into a possible fraudulent prescription for amphetamine mixed
salts’ written on Respondent’s prescription pad. The patient, Patient A®, resides in
Charles County, Maryland, which is over an hour from the location of the pharmacy and
the prescription was dropped off by an individual who resides in Lexington Park,
Maryland. The report noted that when the Pharmacist, who is located in California,
Maryland, called the Respondent’s phone number listed on the prescription to confirm

the prescription and the answering machine did not advise that there was a medical

practice located there. The pharmacist was also concerned because the address of the
prescriber (Respondent) is a residence. The report further documents that the Corporal
also attempted to reach Respondent but received the same voice message. Later in the
day at approximately 11:00 p.m., Respondent called the Corporal and confirmed that
Patient A is his patient although he stated the prescription was for Alprazolam (Xanax).
Respondent agreed to call the Corporal the next day after he retrieved and reviewed
Patient A’s file. When Respondent did not call, on September 20, 2018, the Corporal
called Respondent, who reportedly did not recall their conversation on September 18,
2019. Respondent again stated he would have to get Patient A’s file and he would call
back. The Corporal left messages on Respondent’s answering machine on September 25,
2018 and October 3, 2018 but as of November 15, 2018, Respondent had not returned his
calls.

9. On March 6, 2019, the Board notified Respondent of the investigation and
requested a written response to the complaint, which was enclosed. In addition, the
Board issued a subpoena to Respondent for the complete medical records of fourteen (14)
patients, for his current appointment logs, and also issued a subpoena directing him to
appear at the Board for an interview on April 9, 2019.

10. On March 11, 2019, Board staff received a voicemail from Respondent

regarding the March 6, 2019 correspondence. Respondent’s message raised significant
concerns regarding the effect of his physical mobility limitation on his ability to safely
and competently practice medicine’

11. On March 12, 2019, Board staff called Respondent to discuss his voicemail.
Respondent’s statements raised significant concerns regarding his fitness to practice
medicine.®
IV. Subsequent Investigation of Respondent

12. On Tuesday March 19, 2019, Respondent was interviewed, under oath by
Board staff. The interview took place in the lower level of Respondent’s home, which is
where Respondent sees patients. Board staff waited outside for over 30 minutes for the
Respondent to come to the door and noted that the Respondent used a walker to ambulate
and is unable to walk unassisted. Board staff noted that the “patient area” is extremely
disorganized; cluttered with papers and personal belongings, including two empty animal
cages.” During the interview, the Respondent often paused quite long between answers
and at times provided unsolicited information.

13. On March 19, 2019, Board staff also served Respondent in-person with a
copy of the subpoena for appointment logs previously issued on March 6, 2019 and
requested immediate production of the appointment logs.

14. Board staff requested to see Respondent’s computer room. Respondent

was physically unable to accompany Board staff. Board staff entered the computer room,

document.

located at the end of a long hallway on the lower level and noted the room was extremely

cluttered with mounds of paper. There was also an unlocked box of prescription pads and

a bag of empty prescription bottles with labels on them. Respondent indicated that he

stores his patient medical records in a “bedroom” upstairs on the main level and allowed

Board staff to go upstairs to retrieve the subpoenaed medical records. Board staff noted

the room was cluttered and had a strong smell of urine.

15. During the interview, Respondent stated the following:

a.

Respondent used to see patients in the “study room” where his
computer is located, but no longer does because it is “quite
crowded.” He now sees patients in a room which is accessed
directly through a sliding glass door at the rear of the home;

Patients are referred to him by other physicians and by other
patients;

Patients contact him on his home telephone;

Respondent sees two to nine patients a day, in the afternoon on
Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays;

More than 50% of his patients are on Suboxone. Respondent sees
the Suboxone patients monthly;

Approximately 25 or 30 of his patients are from out-of-state;

Respondent charges between $100 to $350 per visit, depending on
the duration. He does not participate in any insurance program; and
he only accepts cash payments;

Respondent monitors the PDMP. approximately every six months;
although sometimes he does not do so until after the patient has left
because the computer is in another room;

'0 The voice message does not indicate that the person has reached a medical office.

8
Respondent keeps his prescription pad in his chair in the space
between the cushion and the arm;

Respondent denied being intoxicated when he called the sheriff at
11:00 p.m.. He had “no sedative drugs and no alcohol.” He was
hoarse and halting in his speech, a condition which he has had off
and on since the fall;

Respondent assumed that the pharmacist was concerned about the
patient’s use of Alprazolam and Buprenorphine; but instead the
concern was about a prescription for amphetamine mixed salts.
Respondent does not know “what the problem was” with his
prescription. Respondent thinks the concern may have been because
he handwrote his home office address on the top of the pad;

Respondent acknowledged that Family Member A is his patient and
that he has been treating Family Member A since the beginning of
2017, and has prescribed CDS medications for Family Member A;

Respondent maintained a medical record on Family Member A on
his computer"! but it has “disappeared;”

Respondent acknowledged that he is prescribing CDS medications
for himself;

When asked if he plans to continue to prescribe to himself he said,
“what I was planning to do was make an appointment with the
internist/cardiologist and let him take over the prescribing...but I
didn’t get that done yet;” and

Respondent acknowledged that when he spoke with Board staff on
the telephone he could not concentrate because of the pain in his
foot.

On March 19, 2019, during the site visit and interview, Respondent

submitted medical records of eleven patients. Respondent noted that one of the

individuals was no longer his patient.'?. The Board also requested the medical records of

did not have records on himself or Family Member A.
V. Referrals for Examination of Respondent

17. On March 20, 2019, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 14-402(a),
Board staff sent correspondence to Respondent by electronic mail and overnight delivery,
directing him to appear on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 at 1:00 p.m. at the Maryland
Professional Rehabilitation Program (“MPRP”) for an intake evaluation and for the
purpose of scheduling a follow-up examination. Respondent was advised that his
unreasonable failure or refusal to submit to an examination is prima facie evidence of a
licensed medical practitioner’s inability to practice medicine.”

18. Respondent sent an email to Board staff stating he is unable to attend
because of “safety concerns due to difficulty ambulating.” He also requested that the
appointment be rescheduled for a Tuesday or Thursday afternoon. Respondent did not
appear for the scheduled evaluation.

19. On March 26, 2019, Board staff sent correspondence to Respondent by
electronic mail and overnight delivery, directing him to appear on Thursday, April 4,
2019, at 1:00 p.m. at the MPRP for an intake evaluation and for the purpose of
scheduling a follow-up examination. Respondent was advised that his unreasonable

failure or refusal to submit to an examination is prima facie evidence of a licensed

medical practitioner’s inability to practice medicine.

5 Health Occ. § 14-402(c) states: The unreasonable failure or refusal of the licensed . . . individual to
submit to an examination is prima facie evidence of the licensed . . . individual’s’ inability to practice
medicine or the respective discipline competently, unless the Board finds that the failure or refusal was
