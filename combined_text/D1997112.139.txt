At all times relevant hereto, the Respondent was licensed to practice

medicine in Maryland on November 18, 1976. His license is scheduled to
expire on September 30, 2021.

The Respondent practices Internal Medicine and Gastroenterology in a
private office.

Maryland, hereinafter, “Hospital AZ”

On or about August 8, 2019, the Board received a notification from
Hospital A that the Respondent’s privileges to practice as a physician at
Hospital A were suspended due to concerns about his ability to practice
safely.

Hospital A referred the Respondent to a Physician Health Program (the
“Program”), which directed the Respondent to undergo an appropriate
evaluation.

comprehensive evaluation conducted by qualified, licensed practitioners,
who issued a subsequent report on November 4, 2019 with specific

findings.

herein will not be identified in this document, but the Respondent or counsel may request this
information from the Administrative Prosecutor.

On November 7, 2019, the Board received the report from the Program.

and motor profile, he is not able to safely practice as a physician.” The

indefinitely at this time.”

Respondent presents a substantial likelihood of a risk of serious harm to the

public health, safety and welfare.
