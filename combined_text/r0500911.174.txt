ORDER FOR REVOCATION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE RADIOGRAPHY

 

On July 25, 2014, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
(the “Board”) notified DAVID M. HUSH (the “Respondent”), License Number R05009, of
its intent to revoke his license to practice radiography in the State of Maryland under the
Maryland Radiation Therapy, Radiography, Nuclear Medicine Technology, and
Radiology Act (the “Act”), codified at Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. (“Health Occ.”) §§ 14-
5B-101 et seq. (2009 Repl. Vol. and 2013 Supp.).
Specifically, Disciplinary Panel B based its action on the Respondent's violation
of the following provisions of the Act under Health Occ. § 14-5B-14:
(a) In general. -- Subject to the hearing provisions of § 14-405 of this
subtitle, the Board, on the affirmative vote of a majority of the
quorum of the Board, may deny a license to any applicant, or a
disciplinary panel, on the affirmative vote of a majority of the
quorum of the disciplinary panel, may reprimand any licensee,
place any licensee on probation, or suspend or revoke a license if
the licensee:
(1) Fraudulently or deceptively obtains or attempts to obtain a
license or temporary license for the applicant, licensed

individual, holder of a temporary license, or for another;

(3) Is guilty of unprofessional or immoral conduct in the practice
of radiography;

(10) Willfully makes for files a false report or record in the
practice of radiography;
(14) knowingly makes a misrepresentation while practicing
radiography; and

(26) Fails to cooperate with a lawful investigation conducted by
the Board or a disciplinary panel.

The Respondent was notified that an Order for Revocation of License to Practice
Radiography would be executed THIRTY (30) DAYS from the date of service of
Disciplinary Panel B's Notice of Intent to Revoke License to Practice Radiography,
unless the Respondent requested a hearing.

The Respondent was further notified that notice under Md. Code Regs.
10.32.02.03 is sufficient when the charges are served by regular mail or hand delivery
at the address the Respondent maintains for purposes of licensure notice. Md. Code
Ann., State Gov't, § 10-209(c) provides that a person holding a license shall be deemed
to have had reasonable opportunity to know of the fact of service if: (1) the person is
required by law to notify the agency of a change of address within a specified period of
time; (2) the person failed to notify the agency in accordance with the law; (3) the
agency or the Office mailed the notice to the address of record; and (4) the agency did
not have actual notice of the change of address prior to service. Disciplinary Panel B
has received no notice that the Respondent has changed his address.

In order for Disciplinary Panel B not to execute this Final Order, a written request
for hearing had to be received from the Respondent on or before August 27, 2014. The
Respondent failed to request a hearing on or before this date.

FINDINGS OF FACT

Disciplinary Panel B makes the following Findings of Fact:
date of mailing of this Final Order and shall be made as provided for judicial review of a
final decision in the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act, State Gov't Article, § 10-
222 and Title 7, Chapter 200 of the Maryland Rules of Procedure. The cover letter
shows the date on which the Final Order was mailed.

If the Respondent files an appeal, Disciplinary Panel B is a party and should be
served with the court's process. In addition, the Respondent should send a copy to
Disciplinary Panel A's counsel, Noreen Rubin, Assistant Attorney General, at the Office
of the Attorney General, 300 West Preston Street, Suite 302, Baltimore, Maryland
21201. The Administrative Prosecutor is not involved in the circuit court process and

need not be served or copied on pleadings filed in that court.

Fraudulent Applications

DB: By application ("Initial Application") dated September 29, 1997, the
Respondent applied to the Board for certification as a Medical Radiation Technologist.
Under Section 12 in a question, which asked "Have you ever been charged with or
convicted of any criminal act for which you pled nolo contendere, could receive, or did
receive, probation before judgment, or were sentenced to probation or confinement?",
the Respondent answered "No."

6. The Respondent failed to disclose in the Initial Application that on or about
February 13, 1995, he was found guilty of and received probation before judgment for
Theft (Less than $300).

7. In a license renewal application for the 2011 renewal period ("2011
Renewal") the Respondent filed with the Board, dated March 25, 2011, he answered

"No" to a Character and Fitness question, which asked "Have you been charged with or
convicted of any criminal act for which you pled nolo contendere, could receive, or did
receive, probation before judgment or were sentenced to probation or confinement?"

8. The Respondent failed to disclose in the 2011 Renewal that on or about
July 30, 2010, he was convicted of Theft (Less than $500) and placed on supervised
probation for 18 months in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Maryland.

Conduct) and two counts of Telephone Misuse (Repeated Calls) in the Circuit Court for
Baltimore County, Maryland, under Case Numbers 03K13001610 and 03K13001611.

11. — In the Initial Application, the 2011 Renewal and the 2013 Renewal, the
Respondent either affirmed or certified that the information he provided was true and
correct to the best of his knowledge.

Prescription Fraud

12. The Board obtained court records and a police report concerning criminal
charges that were filed on or about August 16, 2013, which alleged that the Respondent
obtained CDS by fraud and/or forged prescription in Baltimore County. The documents
the Board obtained revealed that on or about May 15, 2013, at approximately 3:00 a.m.,

the Respondent called in a prescription for Lortab 10/500 mg. (#90), a Schedule III CDS,
for himself at an area pharmacy (Pharmacy A"). When the pharmacist contacted the
physician ("Physician A"), who purportedly issued the prescription, for verification,
Physician A advised that she had not issued such prescription for the Respondent. The
Pharmacist immediately reported the event to the Baltimore County Police Department.

13. At around 9:00 a.m. that same day, detectives from the Baltimore County
Police Department waited at Pharmacy A parking lot anticipating that the Respondent
would appear in person to pick up the prescription. The detectives observed the
Respondent pull into Pharmacy A in a black Hummer and proceeded to the drive-thru
window. The Respondent asked a pharmacy technician whether his prescription was
ready, at which time the pharmacy technician stated that it was. When the pharmacy
technician told the Respondent that she needed to inform the pharmacist, he quickly
drove away. The detectives did not pursue the Respondent's vehicle, but instead
obtained video footage of the Respondent from the pharmacy's security camera. The
Respondent later called the pharmacy and stated that he would pick up his prescription
next week.

14. Later that same day, the detectives made contact with the Respondent for
an interview. During the interview, the Respondent admitted orally and in writing that he
had called in the prescription for Lortab without Physician A's authorization and that he
knew it was a crime to do so.

Failure to Cooperate

15. In furtherance of its lawful investigation of the Respondent, the Board

issued a Subpoena Ad Testificandum to him on or about November 5, 2013, ordering

him to appear at the Board's offices on November 21, 2013, to give testimony in the
form of an interview. The Respondent failed to appear or otherwise respond to the
Board's subpoena, dated November 5, 2013.

16. The Board reissued the subpoena to the Respondent on or about
November 21, 2013, for an interview scheduled to take place on December 12, 2013,
and on or about December 12, 2013, for an interview scheduled to take place on
December 26, 2013. The Respondent failed to appear or otherwise respond to the
Board's subpoenas, dated November 5, November 21 and December 12, 2013.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Disciplinary Panel B concludes as a
matter of law that the Respondent's failure to disclose: in his Initial Application that he
was granted probation before judgment for Theft (Less than $300) on or about February
13,1995; in his 2011 Renewal that he was convicted of Theft (Less than $500) on or
about March 25, 2011; and in his 2013 Renewal that he had pending charges for
Harassment and Telephone Misuse, constitutes: fraudulently or deceptively obtaining or
attempting to obtain a license or temporary license for the applicant, licensed individual,
holder of a temporary license, or for another, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-5B-
14(a)(1); being guilty of unprofessional or immoral conduct in the practice of
radiography, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-5B-14(a)(3); willfully making or filing a false
report or record in the practice of radiography, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-5B-
14(a)(10); and knowingly making a misrepresentation while practicing radiography, in
violation of Health Occ. § 14-5B-14(a)(14).

Disciplinary Panel B further concludes that the Respondent's admitted attempt to

obtain a Schedule III CDS by fraud on or about May 15, 2013, constitutes being guilty of
unprofessional or immoral conduct in the practice of radiography, in violation of Health
Occ. § 14-5B-14(a)(3).

Finally, Disciplinary Panel B concludes that the Respondent's failure to comply
with the Board's subpoenas, dated November 5, November 21, and December 12, 2013,
constitutes: being guilty of unprofessional or immoral conduct in the practice of
radiography, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-5B-14(a)(3); and failing to cooperate with a
lawful investigation conducted by the Board or disciplinary panel, in violation of Health
Occ. § 14-5B-14(a)(26).

Maryland is hereby REVOKED; and it is further;
