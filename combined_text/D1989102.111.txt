Case No.: 2220-0145
License No.: D19891

Dear Dr. Dabela, Mr. Russell, and Mr. Johansson:

On January 29, 2021, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl.

Vol. & 2019 Supp.).

Pursuant to the Order, on February 10, 2021, Disciplinary Panel A held a postdeprivation
hearing to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. Dr. Dabela, and his counsel,
Mr. Russell attended the hearing on that date. The State was represented by Mr. Johansson,
Assistant Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor. Both parties presented oral arguments at

the hearing.

After considering these arguments at the hearing, the documents in the investigative file,
and a document submitted by Dr. Dabela, Disciplinary Panel A determined that it would
continue the summary suspension imposed on January 29, 2021. Disciplinary Panel A thus will
not lift the summary suspension order. Disciplinary Panel A finds that the public health, safety or

welfare imperatively requires the suspension of Dr. Dabela’s license. See State Gov’t, § 10-

226(c)(2)(i). The order of summary suspension is thus reaffirmed and continues. See COMAR
10.32.02.08H(1).

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, Dr. Dabela has the right to request a full evidentiary hearing
before an Administrative Law Judge at the Office of Administrative Hearings. To receive the
evidentiary hearing, Dr. Dabela or his counsel must file the request for the hearing within TEN
(10) days of the date of this letter. The request for a hearing should be sent to Christine Farrelly,
Executive Director, at the Board’s address. If the hearing is timely requested, the regulations
require that an Administrative Law Judge set the hearing to begin within 30 days of the request,
see COMAR 10.32.02.08I, though that 30-day time period may be waived.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel A resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Christine A. Farrelly, Execptive Direct
Maryland State Board of Physicians
