Re: Kaitlyn Hyler, Radiation Therapist
Case No.: 2220-0058
License No,: 000845

Dear Ms. Hyler and Mr. Brown:

On March 2, 2020, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
RADIATION THERAPY in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t, § 10-
226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2019 Supp.). That Order was sent to Ms. Hyler via electronic
mail and via UPS Next Day Air to her address on record with the Board, which is the address
that she provided at her interview with Board staff.

Pursuant to the Order for Summary Suspension, the hearing was scheduled on March 11,
2020 at 11:15 am. By 1:30 p.m., Ms. Hyler had not appeared. At 1:30 p.m., Panel A held a
postdeprivation hearing to show cause why that suspension should not be continued on the
record, The State was represented by Michael Brown, Assistant Attorney General,
Administrative Prosecutor.

After considering the investigative file and the oral presentation by Mr. Brown,
Disciplinary Panel A determined that it would continue the summary suspension imposed on
March 2, 2020. Disciplinary Panel A thus will not lift the summary suspension order.
Disciplinary Panel A finds that the public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires the
suspension of Ms. Hyler’s license. See State Gov’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i). The order of summary
suspension is thus reaffirmed and continues. See COMAR 10,32.02.08H(1).
