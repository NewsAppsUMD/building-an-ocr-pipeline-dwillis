Case No.: 2222-0128
License No,: D74085

Dear Dr. Kumar and Counsel:

On July 13, 2022, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued
an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE
in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2). On July 27, 2022, Dr.
Kumar was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing before Disciplinary Panel
B to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. Dr. Kumar appeared at the post-
deprivation hearing with counsel. The State was represented by JoAnna Miller, Assistant
Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor.

After consideration of the presentations from the State and Dr. Kumar, Disciplinary Panel
B determined, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the health, safety, and welfare of the
public imperatively required the disciplinary panel to summarily suspend Dr. Kumar’s license
and there exists a substantial risk of serious harm to the public health, safety, and welfare in Dr.
Kumar’s continued practice. Disciplinary Panel B thus will not lift the summary suspension
order, and the summary suspension imposed on July 13, 2022, is reaffirmed and continues in
effect. See COMAR 10.32.02.08H(1).

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board’s regulations, Dr. Kumar has the right to request a full evidentiary
hearing before an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Administrative Hearings. This
request will be granted if the Board receives a written request for the hearing within TEN (10)
days of the date of this letter. Any request for a hearing should be sent to Christine A. Farrelly,
Executive Director, Maryland Board of Physicians, 4201 Patterson Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland
21215, If Dr. Kumar requests such a hearing, the regulations require that an Administrative Law
Judge set the hearing to begin within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08I, though
Dr, Kumar may waive that 30-day requirement.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel B resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely yours,

Signature On File
