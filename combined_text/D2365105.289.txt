1 BACKGROUND

1. At all times relevant hereto, the Respondent was and is licensed to practice
medicine in the State of Maryland. The Respondent was originally licensed to practice
medicine in Maryland on June 21, 1979, under License Number D23651. The
Respondent’s license is current through September 30, 2019.

2. The Respondent is board-certified in pediatrics.

3. At all times relevant hereto, the Respondent was a solo-practitioner
practicing pediatrics at an office located at 188 Thomas Johnson Drive, Frederick,
Maryland 21702.

4. On or about April 30, 2019, the Board opened an investigation of the
Respondent after receiving a telephone call from a Frederick Police Department (“FPD”)
detective (the “Detective”)’ stating that FPD was conducting a criminal investigation of
the Respondent for an alleged sexual offense against a patient (the “Patient”).

Il. BOARD INVESTIGATION

5. As part of its initial investigation, the Board obtained investigative
materials from FPD, including, but not limited to, the Patient’s written statement to FPD
and the Respondent’s audio interview.

6. The investigative materials from FPD revealed that on or about April 28,
2019, the Patient, accompanied by her parents, went to FPD headquarters to report a sex

offense. The Patient initially spoke to an officer and later wrote a statement.

health care facilities referenced in this document by contacting the administrative prosecutor.
 

7. The Patient stated that she had scheduled an appointment with the
Respondent for a follow up on her anxiety medications for April 26, 2019, at 4:00 p.m.

8. On or about Friday, April 26, 2019, the Patient, who was unaccompanied,
arrived at the Respondent’s office at approximately 3:57 p.m. After signing in, a nurse
brought the Patient to an examination room. The nurse took the Patient’s blood pressure
and then left the room.

9. Not long after, the Respondent came into the examination room alone. The
Respondent examined the Patient’s eyes and ears and asked her to lie on her back on the
examination table.

10. After examining the Patient’s abdomen, the Respondent lowered his hand
further down the Patient’s legging and began rubbing her vaginal area. According to the
Patient, the Respondent used his hand to rub her vaginal area for approximately five
minutes, during which he asked the Patient questions about her anxiety and the Patient
began crying.

11. The Respondent did not stop rubbing the Patient’s vaginal area until the
Patient suddenly sat up and asked for a tissue paper to blow her nose. Afterwards, the
Respondent gave the Patient a hug and continued to talk to her about various topics for
some time.

12. When the appointment concluded, the Patient left the examination room to
find that all the staff members had left and that she and the Respondent were alone. The

Patient left the Respondent’s office at approximately 5:16 p.m.
 

13. The Patient stated that after she arrived home, she took a shower
immediately. She told her mother about what occurred during her appointment with the
Respondent the next day on Saturday, April 27, 2019. They both informed her father on
the morning of Sunday, April 28, 2019, right before they reported the incident to FPD.

14. On or about May 3, 2019, a Frederick County grand jury returned a three-
count indictment against the Respondent for: Second Degree Rape, in violation of Md.
Code Ann., Crim. Law (“Crim. Law”) § 3-304; Fourth Degree Sex Offense, in violation
of Crim Law § 3-308(b)(1); and Second Degree Assault, in violation of Crim. Law § 3-
