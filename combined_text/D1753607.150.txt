(the “Board”) hereby SUMMARILY SUSPENDS the license of AKRAM A.
SALIHI, M.D., (the “Respondent”), license number D17536, to practice medicine
in the State of Maryland. Disciplinary Panel A takes such action pursuant to its
authority under Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2) (2014 Repl. Vol. &
2019 Supp.) and Code of Maryland Regulations (““COMAR”) 10.32.02.08B(7)(a),

action.

INVESTIGATIVE FINDINGS

Based on information received by, and made known to Panel A and the
investigatory information obtained by, received by and made known to and
available to Panel A, including the instances described below, Panel A has reason
to believe that the following facts are true:!
‘ The statements regarding the Respondent’s conduct are intended to provide the Respondent with
notice of the basis of the suspension. They are not intended as, and do not necessarily represent a

complete description of the evidence, either documentary or testimonial, to be offered against the
Respondent in connection with this matter.
At all times relevant hereto, the Respondent was licensed to practice
medicine in Maryland. The Respondent was initially licensed to practice
medicine in Maryland on December 19, 1974. His license is scheduled to
expire on September 30, 2021.

The Respondent reports he is Board certified in Pediatrics.

The Respondent practices Pediatric Medicine in a private office.

On or about May 7, 2020, the Board’s staff interviewed the Respondent about
a Complaint regarding the Respondent’s practice. During the interview,
Board staff noticed that the Respondent had difficulty answering many
questions about his background, employment history, and/or employees that
he employed and regularly worked with at his office.

Based on the concerns noted during the interview the Board referred the
Respondent to the Maryland Professional Rehabilitation Program (MPRP)
for an evaluation regarding his fitness to practice medicine.

On or about June 19, 2020, the Respondent participated in an MPRP
evaluation performed by qualified, licensed practitioners, who conducted a
clinical review and examination.

Subsequently, MPRP prepared a report which noted concerns that would
prevent the Respondent from being able to continue to practice in a safe

manner.”

2 The nature of the report is confidential.
8. MPRP recommended that the Respondent voluntarily agree to sign a practice
cessation agreement, and that the Respondent participate in an independent
comprehensive evaluation. MPRP referred the Respondent for an
examination scheduled for June 30, 2020.

9. The Respondent, however, stated that he would not sign the agreement, and
that he wanted to continue to practice until his scheduled date for retirement.
The Respondent stated that he planned to continue to see patients. He also
requested that the comprehensive examination be rescheduled and did not
appear on the scheduled date. Subsequently, the evaluation was rescheduled

for another date.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Based on the foregoing investigative findings, Panel A concludes that the
public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires emergency action in this case,
pursuant to State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2) and COMAR. 10.32.02.08B(7)(a).
