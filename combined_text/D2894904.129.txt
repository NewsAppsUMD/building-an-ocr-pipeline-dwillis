FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

 

Panayiotis A. Baltatzis, M.D. was initially licensed by the Maryland State Board of
Physicians (“Board”) in 1983, and practiced internal medicine. The central issue in this case is
whether Dr, Baltatzis is guilty of unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation
of Maryland Code Ann., Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)Gi), based on his non-compliance with a
2015 Consent Order that required him to permanently close his practice in May 2017, when he
reached the age of 66, Dr. Baltatzis’s lengthy disciplinary history with the Board preceded the
2015 Consent Order and the imposition of this requirement.

BACKGROUND AND DISCIPLINARY HISTORY

Since 1993, Dr. Baltatzis has been subject to repeated discipline by the Board based on
pervasive standard of care and recordkeeping deficiencies. The Board imposed disciplinary
sanctions in 1995, 2005, and 2009, and entered into a Corrective Action Agreement with Dr.
Baltatzis in 1998. For over two decades, the Board also committed itself to significant efforts to
provide Dr, Baltatzis with extensive remedial education, training, and monitoring with the goal
of enabling him to conform his medical care and documentation to appropriate standards.
Consent Order, April 1995: Courses and Peer Review 1995-1997

The Board first found that Dr. Baltatzis failed to meet the standard of care in his
prescribing practices and medical care after a 1993 peer review identified multiple practice

deficiencies including: (1) issuing prescription narcotics to patients whom he had not fully
evaluated or diagnosed; (2) failing to adequately document patient histories and physical
examinations, patient care plans, and progress notes, to the extent that another physician would
find it difficult to continue patient care; and (3) failing to use specialty consultations
appropriately. In a Consent Order, dated April 4, 1995, the Board placed Dr. Baltatzis on
probation for three years and required him to successfully complete Board-approved courses in
prescribing Controlled Dangerous Substances (“CDS”) and medical record-keeping. The Board
also required an annual review of his practice to be conducted by a peer review committee during
the probation.

In June 1995, Dr, Baltatzis began an individualized medical record-keeping tutorial. The
instructor noted 14 areas of concern that required improvement. Upon follow up review, the
instructor found that several of Dr, Baltatzis’s medical records still contained the same type of
deficiencies identified in the initial review. In August 1996, the instructor notified the Board that
Dr. Baltatzis had declined further review of, and instruction in, his medical record keeping
practices. In September 1995, Dr, Baltatzis also completed an intensive controlled substance
management course. In 1997, Dr. Baltatzis’s practice was subject to a peer review, and the peer
reviewers agreed that he failed to meet the standard of care, in part based on his tendency to
prescribe multiple benzodiazepines concurrently with opioids and muscle relaxants with little
attention to the potential addictive toxicity of the drugs. Although the Board terminated Dr.
Baltatzis’s probation in 1998, the Board remained concerned about his patient care.

Corrective Action Agreement, May 1998: Courses and Peer Reviews 2001-2003

As a result of these concerns, the Board and Dr. Baltatzis agreed to a plan of corrective

action and entered into a formal Corrective Action Agreement in May 1998. Dr. Baltatzis agreed

to successfully complete a Board-approved polypharmacy course within 6 months, and a medical
treatment of their ailments. Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 14-101(0). As such, his activities with
Patients C and D constituted the practice of medicine.4

Third, Dr. Baltatzis excepts to the ALJ’s characterization of the 2015 Consent Order as
clear and unambiguous and claims he was confused over the Consent Order’s directives because
he was permitted to retain his medical license. Dr. Baltatzis, however, was ably represented by
counsel when he negotiated the Consent Order in 2015, and he signed the Order voluntarily and
without reservation. He attested on page 13: “I fully understand and comprehend the language,
meaning and terms of the Consent Order.” The plain language of the Consent Order states: ...
“the Respondent shall, as he has indicated is his intention, permanently close his practice in May
2017, when he reaches the age of 66.” No provision of the Consent Order states or implies that
Dr. Baltatzis could continue to engage in the practice of medicine at his private practice because
he was permitted to retain his medical license. When asked about his understanding of the
Consent Order at the hearing, Dr. Baltatzis testified that he understood it required him to close
his practice but allowed him to maintain his license so he could treat weight loss patients at a
weight loss center. (T. 383-84.) The panel agrees with the ALJ that there is nothing unclear ot
confusing about the language of the Consent Order, and rejects Dr. Baltatzis’s claim of confusion
as implausible.

Dr, Baltatzis also takes exception to the ALJ’s recommended sanction of revocation as
unduly severe. He characterizes his violation of the 2015 Consent Order as “limited” and
“technical,” and minimizes his disregard of the disciplinary panel’s directive to permanently
close his practice. Dr. Baltatzis admits that he failed to give appropriate notice to his patients of

the closure, but blames that failure on his inability to sell the practice before May 31, 2017. The

 

4 Bven without a finding that Dr. Baltatzis engaged in the practice of medicine with Patients C and D, the
appropriate sanction would be the same given the facts and circumstances of this case. The panel’s findings with
respect to his activities with these two patients, therefore, does not alter the sanction imposed. :

11
Consent Order’s requirement that he permanently close his practice, however, was not contingent
on his selling the practice. Dr. Baltatzis’s attempt to downplay the nature of his violation is
disconcerting. The panel denies his exception.

Throughout his exceptions, Dr. Baltatzis also ignores the nature and extent of his
disciplinary history since 1993, and the multiple standard of care and record keeping deficiencies
identified by peer reviewers leading to disciplinary orders and corrective action in 1995, 1998,
2005, 2009, and 2015. He further ignores the Board’s decades-long interim efforts to re-educate
him on the core medical competencies directly relevant to his internal medicine practice, and
discounts his inability or unwillingness to improve his knowledge and skills in diagnosing and
treating common medical conditions, and in promoting preventive care. As is evident from the
2015 Consent Order, the type of standard of care violations identified during the many peer
reviews revealed that he could not or would not conform his medical care, treatment, and
documentation to appropriate professional standards, and that factor was foremost in the panel’s
considerations when it required him to permanently close his practice in May 2017. Dr.
Baltatzis’s unequivocal assurance that he would do so was the basis for the panel’s remarkable
forbearance in allowing him to retain his license in 2015. He did not permanently close his
practice in May 2017, or even make timely efforts to do so. Instead, he not only kept the practice
open way beyond the May 2017 deadline, but continued to see, treat and prescribe for patients,
and to engage in the practice of medicine.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Based on the findings of fact and discussion of Dr, Baltatzis’s exceptions, as set forth

above, Disciplinary Panel B concludes that Dr. Baltatzis violated the November 5, 2015 Consent

Order by failing to comply with a condition of that required him to permanently close his

12
practice in May 2017. Panel B also concludes that Dr. Baltatzis is guilty of unprofessional
conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation of Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 14-
404(a)(3)(ii).

SANCTION

For over 25 years, the Board has given Dr. Baltatzis multiple chances to correct his
deficiencies by re-educating him on the essential components of quality medical care integral to
his practice. The Board’s objective was to enable Dr. Baltatzis to provide care and treatment
within appropriate standards, prevent patient harm, and enhance patient safety. At the OAH
hearing, however, despite the overwhelming evidence of his repetitive standard of care
violations, Dr. Baltatzis testified that the Board’s main complaint was his lack of adequate
documentation. (T. 381.) The panel now recognizes, with the benefit of hindsight, that prior
decisions enabling Dr. Baltatzis to retain his license were mistaken and gave him the unfounded
impression that his violations did not endanger patients.

The imposition of progressive discipline is a disciplinary tool essential to the Board’s
mission of protecting the public. Based on Dr. Baltatzis’s successive violations, it is apparent that
the Board’s previous attempts to rehabilitate him were unsuccessful. Dr. Baltatzis, as he has
done since 1993, continues to violate well-established standards of medical care and
documentation in treating patients. Despite multiple courses, supervision, and years of Board
monitoring, it is obvious that he has learned little or nothing from the Board’s remedial efforts
and has shown no meaningful understanding of or commitment to the competent practice of
medicine. Based on Dr, Baltatzis’s propensity for minimizing his pervasive, serious deficiencies,
the panel concludes that the deficiencies are not remediable. Dr. Baltatzis’s insight with regard to

his deficiencies is so poor, the panel is not reassured that he is capable of or committed to safe
medical practice in any setting. The panel’s statutory charge is to protect the public, and the
panel deems revocation necessary to protect the public from Dr. Baltatzis’s continued practice.
ORDER

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, it is, by an affirmative
vote of a majority of the quorum of Board Disciplinary Panel B, hereby:

ORDERED that the license of Panayiotis Baltatzis, M.D., License No. D28949, to
practice medicine in the State of Maryland, is REVOKED; and it is further

ORDERED that the summary suspension of Dr. Baltatzis’s medical license imposed by
Disciplinary Panel A of the Board on September 29, 2017, under Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t §
10-226(c)(2) is TERMINATED as moot; and it is further

ORDERED that this Final Decision and Order is a PUBLIC document pursuant to

Health Oce. § 1-607, § 14-411.1(b)(2), and Gen. Prov. § 4-333(b)(6).

PROPOSED FINDINGS OF FACT

 

! find the following facts by a preponderance of the evidence:

1, At all relevant times, the Respondent was licensed to practice medicine in the
State of Maryland. The Respondent’s license was issued on or about February 15, 1983 and it
was scheduled to expire on September 30, 2018. (State Ex. 1.)

2. The Respondent practiced internal medicine, His primary practice was general in
nature and located in Parkville, Maryland, in an office building the Respondent owns. The
Respondent’s patients were mostly adults. Many of the Respondent’s patients were immigrants
of Greek descent and a significant percentage of them communicated primarily in Greek, which
the Respondent also fluently speaks, (T.? Respondent.)

3. A number of the Respondent’s patients had issues with chronic pain, and he would
prescribe pain medications, some of which were classified as controlled dangerous substances
(CDS). (T. Respondent.)

4, Sometime in 2010, the Respondent began working, on a part-time basis, at the

Center QM). His primary duties involved seeing patients to
determine whether they were losing weight and, if not, to develop a plan to address why they were
not doing so and to help them do so; prescribe the appetite suppressant Phentermine to patients
when appropriate; and when necessary, do a brief examination of new patients. (T. | y

5, Phentermine is a CDS, The physicians who worked at BR had both

prescribing and dispensing privileges for Phentermine, which meant they were authorized to

3 The abbreviation “T” stands for testimony.
write patients prescriptions for the drug and also dispense it to the patients while on the Center’s
premises. The Respondent had prescribing privileges for Phentermine. (Id. .
6. The Respondent has the following disciplinary history with the Board, prior to
November 5, 2015:
e Consent Order, April 4, 1995
© Corrective Action Agreement, May 27, 1998
e Final Opinion and Order, March 22, 2005
e Final Decision and Order, October 20, 2009
(State Ex. 2; State Exs, 26, 28-30.)
7. On November 5, 2015, the Respondent entered into the Consent Order with the
Board. Under the Consent Order, the Board concluded as a matter of law that the Respondent
failed to meet the appropriate standard of quality care and failed to maintain adequate medical
records in violation of the Act. The Board imposed a reprimand on the Respondent, and ordered
the following: (i) the Respondent was permitted to retain his license to practice medicine, but he
was to remain on probation for the entire duration of his licensure, (ii) the Respondent “shall, as
he has indicated is his intention, permanently close his practice in May 2017, when he reaches
age [sixty-six] ... Respondent shall provide to the Panel written documentation of the office
closure”; and (iii) the Respondent could not accept any new patients to his practice from the date
of the Consent Order through the date on which he closed the practice. (State Ex, 31, p. 280.)
The Respondent signed the acknowledgment that he was entering the Consent Order voluntarily
on or about October 20, 2015. Ud., p. 282.)
8. Between November 5, 2015 and May 10, 2017, the Respondent made at least two
efforts to sell his practice, one to [EERE the owner of [RIMM and one to Pod
Neither effort was successful. (T. MRBE T. Respondent.)

9. The Respondent turned sixty-six on May 10, 2017, (T. Respondent.)
record keeping course within 18 months. He also agreed to a peer review of his medical practice
within 9 months.

The peer review conducted in 2001 identified standard of care deficiencies that included
prescribing multiple CDS and opioid analgesics in the absence of documentation to support the
prescriptions. The Board notified Dr. Baltatzis of these deficiencies and informed him that he
would be subject to another review in six months. A subsequent chart review revealed Dr.
Baltatzis’s failure to document complete history and physical examinations, order basic
laboratory studies, conduct routine cancer screening, or record rectal or pelvic examinations.

In 2003, the Board referred the patient medical records to two peer reviewers who
concluded that Dr, Baltatzis deviated from standards of quality care and documentation because
he failed to order or recommend routine health maintenance screening such as colorectal and
prostate screening, mammograms and Pap smears for patients over 50 years old. The reviewers
also concluded that he failed to order laboratory studies consistently to monitor for possible side
effects of medications he prescribed. In addition, they found that he failed to document past
medical or family history, failed to document patient complaints in adequate detail, failed to
consistently document a current medication list, medication allergies or significant side effects,
and failed to document his clinical thought processes or approaches to the treatment of patients’
presenting complaints.

Final Opinion and Order, March 22, 2005: Courses and Peer Review 2005-2007

After the issuance of charges based on the 2003 peer review reports, and an evidentiary
hearing at the Office of Administrative Hearings (“OAH”) before an Administrative Law Judge
(“ALJ”), the Board found that Dr. Baltatzis violated the standard of care with respect to clinical

care and record-keeping in his treatment of five patients. The specific violations included failure
10. By letter dated May 15, 2017 and addressed to “All My Patients and Friends,” the
Respondent advised that he was retiring from medical practice, effective June 1, 2017. The letter
further advised that beginning June 1, 2017, Dr. [RRR would see patients at the Parkville
office location on a part-time basis on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays from 9:30 a.m. to”
3:00 p.m, Additionally, the letter indicated the Respondent would be at the office to “assist you
with questions and records through the month of June.” (State Ex. 4.) Finally, the letter noted
the Respondent would be vacationing in Greece from July 1, 2017 through August 14, 2017, and
that upon his return in mid-August, he would be available to assist with referrals and records.

ll, On or around June 8, 2017, the Respondent entered into an employment
agreement with Dr. Ee Under the agreement, Dr. Biagreed to provide temporary, part-time
medical coverage “for the patients and practice of medicine for [the Respondent] until] such time
as the [Respondent] can arrange for full time permanent medical coverage for his patients and
medical practice.” The agreement further provided, “[The Respondent] will continue to own the
practice and run the business of the above medical practice.” (State Ex. 7.)

12. Dr. experienced difficulty interacting with the patients in the Respondent’s
practice, primarily because many of them only spoke Greek, which he did not speak. Asa result,
it was nearly impossible for him to take a medical or family history without the Respondent
present during the examination to act as an interpreter. As a result of the language barrier, it was
difficult for Dr. | to build rapport and bond with the patients, i

13, On or around DY first day working at the Respondent’s practice, the
practice was visited by investigators from the Board, When the investigators expressed concern

- about the practice being open, Dr. Eo expressed concern to the investigators about whether his
employment arrangement with the Respondent was permissible in light of the Consent Order, At

least one of the investigators advised Dr. tet the Board would get back to him with
guidance, Dr. ew! did not hear from the Board investigators at any point during June 2017 and,
as a result, he resigned from the practice on or around June 28, 2017. (id.)

14, On June 13, 2017, Zach Spivey, accompanied by a colleague, conducted a site visit
at the Respondent’s Parkville office location. At the time of the June 13, 2017 visit, there were
patients present in the waiting room and both the Respondent and Dr, Ba were on site. The
Respondent advised Mr. Spivey that while he still owned the practice, Dr. wes responsible
for providing patient care. The Respondent further advised he was occasionally present in the
examination room if Dr. [jj required him to interpret for the patient, and he occasionally filled
information in on the patients’ chart or took their blood pressure readings. (T. Spivey; State Ex. 2.)

15, When Dr. ee advised the Respondent that he was resigning, effective June 28,
2017, several of the patients in the Respondent’s practice came to the office to get prescriptions
written, as there would be no physician working in the practice as of July 1, 2017. Asa result,
the Respondent wrote some prescriptions on June 29, 2017, (T. Respondent; State Ex. 34.)

16. The Respondent went on vacation to Greece on or around July 1, 2017. He returned
to the United States on or around August 12, 2017. (T. Respondent; State Ex. 9.)

17. The Respondent travels to Greece for an extended period of approximately four to
six weeks every summer. As a result, he got into the habit of writing post-dated prescriptions for
patients with chronic conditions and whose medications required a refill while the Respondent
was scheduled to be out of town. (T. Respondent.)

18. While the Respondent was vacationing in Greece, his office staff called
prescriptions into pharmacies for patients during July and August 2017, (7. a)

19. On August 16, 2017, Patient A‘ came to the Parkville office for pain complaints

and weight loss treatment, The Respondent prescribed the appetite suppressant Phentermine and

 

“To preserve confidentiality, patients will be referred to alphabetically,

6
the pain medication Lortab for Patient A. During the visit, Patient A advised the Respondent that
his wife, Patient B, needed a refill of her prescription for Phentermine. The Respondent also
wrote a Phentermine prescription for Patient B on August 16, 2017, (T. Respondent.)

20. On August 16, 2017, Patient C came to the Parkville office for the Respondent to
sign a medical authorization form for Patient C to take his portable oxygen tank aboard an
airplane. (T. Respondent; T. Spivey; State Ex. 16, 17, 19.)

21. On August 17, 2017,-Mr. Spivey, accompanied by Doreen Noppinger, Board
Compliance Manager, conducted an unannounced site visit at the Parkville office. Mr. Spivey
and Ms, Noppinger arrived to the premises at approximately 9:40 a.m. While waiting in their
vehicle, they observed an elderly gentlemen enter the practice at approximately 10:00 a.m. (T.
Spivey; State Ex. 14.)

22, On August 17, 2017, Patient D came to the Parkville office for the Respondent to
fill out the medication authorization form for Patient D’s CPAP machine. Patient D was the
individual observed’by Mr. Spivey-and Ms. Noppinger entering the practice on the morning of
August 17, 2017. (T. Respondent; T. Spivey; State Ex. 14.)

23, While the Respondent was attending to Patient D, Mr. Spivey and Ms. Noppinger
entered the practice. They asked the receptionist, oe if the Respondent was
available and she confirmed he was seeing a patient. Patient D came out of the examining room
and exited the practice as Mr. Spivey and Ms. Noppinger waited to speak with the Respondent.
(T. Spivey; State Ex, 14.)

24. During their August 17, 2017 site visit, Mr. Spivey and Ms. Noppinger asked to.
see the Respondent’s records, including appointment logs from June 1, 2017 to the present, and
the employment agreement between the.Respondent and Dr. | Additionally, they

interviewed [RRM During the visit, the Respondent advised Mr. Spivey and Ms.
 

Noppinger that he had located a buyer for the practice, a clinical nurse practitioner named
BR. (State Ex. 14.)

25. During the August 17, 2017 site visit, Ms. Noppinger advised the Respondent that
the Board had received information alleging he had another patient scheduled for later in the day
on August 17, and she asked him if he had any other patients scheduled. The Respondent
advised her that he did not know. When Mr. Spivey and Ms. Noppinger inquired how patients
were scheduled, the Respondent advised them that because his office is open, patients sometimes
randomly showed up and asked to be seen, (Jd.)

26. As Mr, Spivey and Ms. Noppinger were leaving the practice on August 17, 2017,
they observed ‘a woman entering the practice. (T. Spivey; State Ex. 15.)

27, Patient E entered the Respondent’s practice as the Board investigators were
leaving on August 17, 2017. Patient E complained of issues related to arthritis and weight loss.
The Respondent conducted a limited physical examination of Patient E and wrote her
prescriptions for Lortab and Phentermine. (T. Respondent.)

28. On or around August 23, 2017, ie over the Parkville office, which
she renamed RR Center, and began regularly seeing patients. The sale of the
practice from the Respondent to mz: finalized on or around September 26, 2017.
The Respondent maintains an office within the building, but he does not see patients. vi

DISCUSSION
Legal Framework

The relevant grounds for reprimand or probation of a licensee, or suspension or

revocation of a license under the Act, include the following: .

(a) - In general. — Subject to the hearing provisions of § 14-405 of this subtitle, a
disciplinary panel, on the affirmative vote of a majority of the quorum of the

8
disciplinary panel, may reprimand any licensee, place any licensee on probation,
or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee:

(3) Is guilty of:

(ii) Unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine[.]
Mad. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii) (Supp. 2018). Unprofessional conduct refers to
conduct that breaches rules or ethical codes of professional conduct, or is conduct unbecoming a
member in good standing in the profession. Finucan v. Maryland Bd. of Physician Quality
Assurance, 380 Md. 577, 593 (2004).

In a physician disciplinary proceéding, the Act, at Section 14-405(b)(2), places upon
the State the burden of proving its charges by a preponderance of the evidence. For the reasons
set forth below, I conclude the State has satisfied its burden with respect to the charges under the
Act at § 14-404(a)(3)(ii).

The Merits of the Case
Arguments of the Parties

The State argued the Respondent engaged in unprofessional conduct in the practice of
medicine by violating the conditions of the Consent Order when he failed to close his medical
practice as of May 31,2017. The State argued the evidence overwhelmingly supports a finding
that the Respondent kept his practice open after May 3 1, 2017, in anumber of ways: he retained
his stat TS 2 I ; be hired Dr. BB he wrote
prescriptions for patients in June and August 2017; and in August 2017, he saw Patients A, C, D
and E at the practice. He prescribed medications for Patients A, B, and E in August 2017, and he
signed medical authorization forms for Patients C and D in that same month.

The State further argued that under the Consent Order, the Respondent had ample time to
close the practice. The Consent Order was signed on November 5, 2015, but Respondent had

9
until May 31, 2017 to permanently close the practice.° According to the State, there is no good
explanation for the Respondent failing to close his practice by May 31, 201 7° The State further
argued the Respondent did not permanently close his practice until September 26, 2017, when
the contract for sale with [RRR was finalized. The State maintained the Respondent .
waited until “the last minute” to try to sell his practice. He did not start talking to anyone else
about possibly buying the practice until mid- to late Spring 2017, and he did not notify his
patients that he was retiring until May 15, 2017, approximately sixteen days before the practice
was to close. The Respondent put himself in an untenable position by waiting so late to try to
sell the practice, but his doing so does not.excuse his failure to close the practice as of May 31,
2017. By failing to permanently close his practice as of May 31, 2017, the Respondent violated
the Consent Order. His action in violating the Consent Order, according to the State, is
unprofessional conduct.

With respect to a sanction, the State recommended a revocation of the Respondent’s
medical license. The State noted the Respondent has a prior disciplinary history with the Board,
and his prior disciplinary history should be taken into consideration in determining the
appropriate sanction. The State argued that the Board has given the Respondent multiple
opportunities to improve and remediate the problems with his practice. That the Respondent still
had difficulty conforming his behavior to professional standards was an issue for the Board at the
time it entered into the Consent Order. According to the State, this case represents another

example of the Respondent’ s inability or unwillingness to conform his behavior to the standards

 

5 The period between November 5, 2015 and May 31, 2017 is eighteen months.

61 also note that May 31, 2017 is a generous reading of the Consent Order, On its face as written, the Consent Order
requires the practice to be permanently closed when the Respondent reached sixty-six years old, which he did on
May 10, 2017. A strict reading of the Consent Order holds the practice should have been permanently closed by
May 10, 2017. By treating the Consent Order as though it required the practice to be closed by May 31, 2017, the
State adopted a reading of the Consent Order that is actually more favorable to the Respondent, because it gave him
twenty-one additional days within which the practice had to be permanently closed.

10
set for him by the Board, specifically by refusing to close his practice and by continuing to see
patients even after he was no longer permitted to do so.

The Respondent disagreed with the State’s characterization of him as someone who fails
to comply with the Board. He explained that he is an old-fashioned family doctor. He knows his
patients and their histories well, he has an excellent rapport with his patients, and his patients are
loyal to and love him. The Respondent acknowledged he has a lengthy disciplinary history. He
argued that despite this fact, he has always complied with the Board’s orders, He further noted |
the Board itself, through its prior orders, allowed the Respondent to continue practicing medicine,
as the Board’s primary issues with him centered around documentation of his medical records.
According to the Respondent, the Board never considered the Respondent to be a danger to
patients throughout all the years he was subject to monitoring by the Board. The Respondent
further explained that under the Consent Order, he was permitted to maintain his medical license,
because he was so permitted, it was his understanding that he could continue to practice medicine
— such as he did with zt but he could not continue to operate his practice at the
Parkville office.

Additionally, the Respondent explained that he wanted to keep his practice open via a
buyer who could seamlessly continue to provide care because there are not a lot of physicians
providing care for older adults in the community. He argued that he hired ms to help with
the transition and because he believed it gave him more time to find a buyer for the practice.

The Respondent maintained that while he was in Greece, he did not see, examine,
evaluate, or diagnosis patients, Although he acknowledged there are prescriptions dated for the
period he was in Greece (from July 1, 2017 through or around August 12, 2017), he argued this
was because he post-dated the prescriptions ‘0 patients could have them filled if refills were due

while he was out of town. The Respondent disputed any assertion that he provided medical care

]1
to Patients C and D. He argued that all he did for Patient C was to sign the form to allow him to
take oxygen onto a commercial airplane; all he did for Patient D was to sign the form
reauthorizing his CPAP machine. According to the Respondent, he did not have to examine
either patient to sign those forms and he did not examine them when they came in because he
was aware he was not allowéd to practice under the Consent Order.

The Respondent argued he made a “good faith effort” to close his practice. He had the
intent to comply with the Consent Order and he attempted to comply with the Consent Order by
hiring Dr. | work in a transitional capacity and by making arrangements with ia
to sell the practice to her. The Respondent conceded the possibility he committed a “technical
violation” of the Consent Order, He argued that to the extent it was only a technical violation,
it does not rise to a level which requires the revocation of his license. The Respondent
recommended a dismissal of the charges.

Analysis

I note at the outset that a great deal of time was spent at the hearing with the parties
disagreeing with each other about when the Respondent wrote certain prescriptions, and whether
certain interactions with patients — specifically, Patients C and D — actually constituted the
practice of medicine because the Respondent did not evaluate, examine, or diagnose Patients C
and D when he interacted with them. While all of the back and forth provided important and
engaging context, it was secondary to the central and solitary question before me: Did the
Respondent permanently close his medical practice on or before May 31, 2017? That question is
the crux of this matter and the answer to it informs my finding that the Respondent violated
Section 14-404(a)(3)(ii) of the Act,

The Consent Order is, as the State correctly noted, direct and unambiguous. It provided

that the Respondent “shall ... permanently close his practice in May 2017 and ... shall provide to

12
the Panel written documentation of the office closure.” (State Ex. 31, p. 280.) There is nothing
unclear or confusing about the language of the Consent Order. The Respondent was to
permanently close his practice in May 2017. The evidence before me overwhelmingly
demonstrates the Respondent’s practice was open well after May 31, 2017.

—oee and Dr. Siifall testified about the fact that they worked for the
Respondent, at the Parkville office, during June, July, and August 2017. They were working at
the office because the office was still open after May 31,2017. am mindful that the Respondent
hired Dr. Ee to help with the transition into the Respondent’s retirement, but even the hiring of
| is a violation of the Consent Order. Dr. es an employee of the Respondent. He
was not running the practice as though it was his practice; he was working for the Respondent.
The fact of Dr. JW employment, short though his tenure was, standing alone supports a
finding that the practice was still open afier May 31, 2017. There would have béen no need for
the Respondent to hire Dr. BB. keep the practice running while the Respondent attempted to
secure a buyer, had the Respondent closed the practice on May 31, 2017. The very fact that Dr.
aes working for the Respondent in June 2017 (from June 8 through June 28, 2017)
supports a finding the practice was still open after May 31, 2017.

The Respondent seems to conflate “practicing medicine,” with “permanently closing the
practice,” such that if he can successfully argue he did not do the former, then it somehow means
he did do the latter, I do not find the argument persuasive, for a number of reasons. First and
foremost, the Consent Order’s directive is for the practice to permanently close. It does not
indicate that as long as the Respondent does not engage in conduct which is considered
practicing medicine, that restraint is the equivalent of closing his medical practice. Second, the
Respondent actually engaged in practicing medicine at his Parkville medical office after May 31,

2017. He examined Patient A on August 16, 2017, and wrote prescriptions for Patient A and his

13
wife, Patient B, on that same date, He examined Patient E on August 17, 2017 and wrote
prescriptions for Patient E on that same date. Even if I assume for the sake of argument that
merely :signing medical authorization forms for Patients C and D somehow does not constitute
the “practice of medicine” within the meaning of the Act, the Respondent cannot successfully
argue he did: not practice medicine at any time after May 31, 2017. He did, in his interactions
with Patients A and E, and in writing prescriptions for Patients A, B and E.

The Respondent’s practice was open after May 31, 2017 and he engaged in practicing
medicine, at his medical office, after May 31,2017. Furthermore, even if Patients C and D “just”
got medical authorization forms signed on August 16 and 17, 2017, they were able to do so
precisely because the Respondent’s medical practice was open on those dates. Even if I give the
Respondent the benefit of the doubt and accept as tue his acknowledgment that the earliest point
at which his staff stopped scheduling patients was on June 29, 2017 (after Dr. a quit on June
28, 2017), that still represents almost an entire month the practice was open after May 31, 2017."

A significant amount of time was spent at the hearing around the issue of prescriptions .
written in June and July 2017 and bearing the Respondent’s signature. (See State Ex. 34.) The
Respondent maintained he had gotten into the practice, over the years, of post-dating prescriptions
for his patients to get filled during a time when he was out of the state or country, because he
regularly visited Greece for approximately four to six weeks every summer. The State argued it
was not appropriate for the Respondent to write post-dated prescriptions, particularly for CDS,
and it cited to federal regulations in support of its position. What is most persuasive to me,
however, is the simple fact that the reason patients were able to obtain their prescriptions during

the time the Respondent was in Greece was because his medical practice was still open. i

 

7 As noted, this is giving the Respondent the benefit of the doubt that no patients were seen after June 29, 2017. The
evidence demonstrates patients were scheduled in August 2017.

14
to educate an at-risk patient about the potential for a stroke, failure to follow up with another
patient about a CT scan showing a nodule on the patient’s lung, failure to treat a patient’s high
blood pressure for five months, and failure to order routine maintenance Pap and mammography
screenings, as well as requisite bloodwork for hyperthyroidism and diabetes.

Although the ALJ recommended revocation of Dr. Baltatzis’s license, the Board
exercised extraordinary leniency and gave him another opportunity for continued education and
remediation and monitoring of his practice. On March 22, 2005, the Board imposed a stayed
suspension of Dr. Baltatzis’s license and probation for five years, during which he was required
to enroll in and complete courses in diabetes, thyroid disease, hypertensive disease, vascular
disease, and a third course in medical record-keeping. In addition, his practice was subject to
another peer review.

The Board conducted a formal peer review of 10 patient medical records, focusing on Dr.
Baltatzis’s treatment of patients after March 2005. In April 2008, based on the peer review
results, the Board again charged Dr. Baltatzis with failing to meet appropriate standards for the
delivery of quality medical care, failing to keep adequate medical records, and violating the
March 2005 Final Opinion and Order.

Final Decision and Order, October 20, 2009, Course, Supervision, and Peer Review

After an evidentiary hearing on the charges at OAH, the Board again found that Dr.
Baltatzis violated the standard of quality care during the 20-month peer review period with
respect to 7 patients. In general, the violations involved his failure to properly monitor and treat
diabetes, hypertension, depression, gastroesophageal reflux disease, symptomatic prostatic
hypertrophy, cerebrovascular disease, hyperlipidemia, and his failure to document patient
referrals and specialist examinations. The Board imposed another 5-year period of probation,

with conditions that included completion of a course in the management of diabetes and related

who worked for the Respondent until Ms. a over the office on or around August
23, 2017, testified without contradiction that she called prescriptions into pharmacies on behalf of
patients during June, July, and August 2017. She was able to do this precisely because the
Respondent’s practice was not closed after May 31, 2017.

I] am sympathetic, to a point, to how difficult the idea of permanently closing his practice
likely was for the Respondent. It was clear from his testimony, as well as that of | |
Dr. | how much care and regard the Respondent had for his patients and they
for him, Additionally, being a practicing physician is no doubt a significant part of the
Respondent’s identity; he has been a licensed physician in Maryland for approximately thirty-five
years, | have no trouble understanding how being required to permanently close his practice
would be personally and professionally daunting to the Respondent. It is, however, what he was
required to do under the Consent Order. I do not find that he made a good faith effort to close the
practice by the deadline specified in the Consent Order. On the contrary, the evidence clearly
demonstrates he extended, on his own volition, the period the practice was open. He did not hire
Dr. i June 8, 2017. He wrote prescriptions for patients after May 31,2017. ‘He
examined patients and wrote prescriptions for them in August 2017. He did not finalize the sale of
the practice to Ms. ma September 26, 2017.. The Respondent did not conform his
conduct to the terms he agreed to in the Consent Order. Failing to comply with the directives of
the entity which oversees one’s licensure is unprofessional conduct in the practice of the
profession. | find by a preponderance of the evidence that the Respondent failed to permanently
close his medical practice by May 31, 2017. In failing to do so, the Respondent violated the
terms of the Consent Order, By violating the Consent Order, the Respondent violated Section

14-404(a)(3)(ii) of the Act.

15
Sanctioning Recommendation

Having found the State proved the Respondent engaged in unprofessional conduct in
the practice of medicine, I now tum to the question of what sanction, if any, is appropriate. The
State recommended a revocation of the Respondent’s license.

The guiding regulations in this matter, found at COMAR 10,32.02.09B, provide in
pertinent part as follows:

B. Aggravating and Mitigating Factors.

(1) Depending on the facts and circumstances of each case, and to the extent
that the facts and circumstances apply, the disciplinary panel may consider the
aggravating and mitigating factors set out in §B(5) and (6) of this regulation
and may in its discretion determine, based on those factors, that an exception
should be made and that the sanction in a particular case should fall outside the
range of sanctions listed in the sanctioning guidelines. ‘

(5) Mitigating factors may include, but are not limited to, the following:

(a) The absence of a prior disciplinary record,

(b) The offender self-reported the incident;

(c) The offender voluntarily admitted the misconduct, made full disclosure to
the disciplinary panel and was cooperative during the disciplinary panel
proceedings;

(d) The offender implemented remedial measures to correct or mitigate the
harm arising from the misconduct;

(e) The offender made good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify the
consequences of the misconduct,

(f) The offender has been rehabilitated or exhibits rehabilitative potential;

(g) The misconduct was not premeditated,

(h) There was no potential harm to patients or the public or. other adverse
impact; or

(i) The incident was isolated and is not likely to recur.

(6) Aggravating factors may include, but are not limited to, the following:

(a) The offender has a previous criminal or administrative disciplinary history;
(b) The offense was committed deliberately or with gross negligence or
recklessness;

(c) The offense had the potential for or actually did cause patient harm;

(d) The offense was part of a pattern of detrimental conduct;

(c) The offender committed a combination of factually discrete offenses
adjudicated in a single action;

16
(f) The offender pursued his or her financial gain over the patient’s welfare;

(g) The patient was especially vulnerable,

(h) The offender attempted to hide the error or misconduct from patients or
0) The offender concealed, falsified or destroyed evidence, or presented false
testimony or evidence,

() The offender didnot cooperate with the investigation; or

(k) Previous attempts to rehabilitate the offender were unsuccessful,

The State argued the existence of a significant aggravating factor, namely, the
Respondent’s prior disciplinary history. Additionally, the State argued the Respondent’s
disciplinary history demonstrates the Board has given him multiple opportunities to improve and
remediate the problems with his medical practice and he was not able to do so, which is why he

-has the lengthy disciplinary history. In this specific instance, the Respondent was not willing to
permanently close his practice as directed to by the Board and, in fact, he failed to permanently
close his practice as directed to by the Board.

Based on the evidence before me, I find that revocation of the Respondent’s license is the
appropriate sanction. Given his disciplinary history, the Respondent is aware of both (1) the
need to comply with Consent Orders and Final Orders issued by the Board, and (2) how
seriously the Board takes it when licensees fail to do so. The Respondent essentially refused to
conform his conduct to terms to which he agreed ~ the permanent closing of his practice as of
May 2017. Whatever explanation he may have related to the inability to find a buyer for the
practice by May 31, 2017 does not mitigate his refusal to conform his conduct to the terms of the
Consent Order, The closing of the practice was not, under the terms of the Consent Order,
contingent on whether the Respondent could find a buyer. There were no qualifications
whatsoever on the directive to permanently close the practice in May 2017. Despite the Consent

Order’s clear and unambiguous directive, the Respondent ignored it, Given his disciplinary

history and his likely awareness of the seriousness with which licensees are expected to take the

17
Board’s orders, I do not find any significant mitigating factor that makes the Respondent’s
failure to comply with the Consent Order in any way excusable. I recommend a revocation of
the Respondent’s license to practice medicine.
PROPOSED CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Based on the Proposed Findings of Fact and Discussion, J conclude as a matter of law
that the Respondent is guilty of unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine as a result of
violating the terms of a November 5, 2015 Consent Order by failing to permanently close his
medical practice in May 2017. Md. Code Ann., Health Occ., § 14-404(a)(3)(ii) (Supp. 2018).

I further conclude as a matter of law that a revocation of the Respondent’s license to
practice medicirie constitutes a reasonable and appropriate sanction. Md. Code Ann., Health
Occ., § 14-404(a) (Supp. 2018).

PROPOSED DISPOSITION

 

I PROPOSE that the Maryland State Board of Physicians’ October 26, 2017 charges
against the Respondent be UPHELD.

I further PROPOSE that the Respondent’s license to practice medicine be revoked.

Consent Order, November 5, 2015: Findings and Permanent Condition

In 2013, the Board received a complaint from a former patient of Dr. Baltatzis, who
alleged that he failed to address the physical causes of her chronic pelvic pain and did not
attempt to wean her off the CDS he prescribed for her. The Board began an investigation, and
subsequently performed a peer review of his medical care and recordkeeping. On November 5,
2015, Dr. Baltatzis entered into a Consent Order with Disciplinary Panel A of the Board to
resolve charges of general practice deficiencies, as well as failure to meet appropriate standards
of care and failure to maintain adequate medical records in his treatment of three specific
patients. The practice deficiencies included Dr. Baltatzis’s failure to address chronic health
maintenance issues such as colon cancer screening, failure to address a patient’s presenting
complaint, failure to address abnormal lab results with patients or to follow-up on abnormal
results, as well as brief and incomplete patient histories, notes that were scant and difficult to
read, and two-word treatment plans.

The specific standard of care violations for each patient included Dr. Baltatzis’s failure to
develop a treatment plan to address the complaining patient’s long-standing pelvic pain other
than prescribing opioids on a regular basis from 2001 through 2013. Panel A also found that Dr.
Baltatzis violated standards of quality care based on his treatment of a second patient with a
complex medical history that included Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (“COPD”),
coronary artery disease, hypertension, kidney stones, bladder and lung cancer. When the patient’s
blood tests indicated anemia, Dr. Baltatzis failed to consider that the patient’s severe COPD

would have resulted in a markedly elevated hematocrit level and that her anemia may have been
more severe than indicated by the lab results. Panel A also found that two pre-operative
examination reports completed by Dr. Baltatzis for this patient were incomplete, based on his
failure to document for the benefit of the surgeon whether the patient had cardiac or any other
medical risks. In addition, Panel A found that Dr. Baltatzis provided substandard treatment to a
third patient in her eighties with Alzheimer’s disease. He prescribed benzodiazepines, which alter
mental status, and Seroquel, an atypical anti-psychotic, a medication regimen that is
contraindicated in patients with that disease.

Under the 2015 Consent Order, Panel A imposed a reprimand, and placed Dr. Baltatzis on
probation for the entire duration of his medical licensure. More significantly, based on the
panel’s concerns about the enduring and irremediable nature of Dr. Baltatzis’s standard of care
and documentation deficiencies, and his indication to the panel that he intended to permanently
close his practice in May 2017, when he reached the age of 66, the Consent Order required Dr.
Baltatzis’s compliance and permanent closure of his practice. The Consent Order also required
him to provide the panel with written documentation of the office closure, and prohibited his
acceptance of any new patients to his practice between the date of the Order and the date he
closed his practice.

Violation of Consent Order and Subsequent Procedural History

The Board began another investigation after receiving information that Dr. Baltatzis
continued to treat patients in his private practice after May 2017. The investigation revealed that
Dr. Baltatzis continued to treat patients at his practice and to write prescriptions that included
CDS and non-CDS medications in June, July and August, 2017. On September 29, 2017,
Disciplinary Panel A summarily suspended Dr. Baltatzis’s medical license, and on October 26,

2017, charged him with failing to permanently close his practice in May 2017, in violation of the
2015 Consent Order’s requirement that he do so, and with unprofessional conduct in the practice
of medicine, under Md. Code Ann, Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii).

Both the summary suspension and charges alleged a violation of the 2015 Consent
Order based on his continued treatment of, and prescribing for, his patients at his medical
practice, after the date he agreed to close his practice in May 2017. Following a post-deprivation
hearing before Panel A on November 15, 2017, the panel affirmed the summary suspension. Dr.
Baltatzis timely appealed the summary suspension and waived the requirement that a hearing be
held within 30 days of the request for appeal. Dr. Baltatzis and the State agreed to consolidate the
OAH hearings for the summary suspension and charges.

. An evidentiary hearing took place at OAH on July 9, 12, and 13, 2018. Ina Proposed
Decision issued on October 11, 2018, the ALJ found that the direct and unambiguous language
of the November 5, 2015 Consent Order required Dr. Baltatzis to permanently close his practice
in May 2017. She also found that he kept his practice open after May 2017, employed a
physician to keep the practice running in June 2017; continued to employ staff and allow patients
to obtain prescriptions during June, July, and August, 2017; practiced medicine and examined
and treated patients in his medical office after May 2017, all in violation of the Consent Order’s
requirement that he permanently close his practice in May 2017. The ALJ concluded that Dr.
Baltatzis engaged in unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation of § 14-
404(a)(3)(ii) of the Health Occupations Article, and recommended that his medical license be
revoked.

Dr. Baltatzis filed written exceptions to the ALJ’s Proposed Decision and the State filed a
Response to Dr, Baltatzis’s exceptions. Both parties appeared before Disciplinary Panel B of the

Board for an oral exceptions hearing on December 19, 2018. After considering the entire record
in this case, including the evidentiary record made before the ALJ, and the written and oral
exceptions by both parties, Panel B now issues this Final Decision and Order.

FINDINGS OF FACT

Panel B adopts the findings of fact numbered 1-28 proposed by the ALI. (The ALJ’s
Proposed Decision of October 11, 2018, is incorporated by reference into this Final Decision and
Order and is appended to this Order as Attachment A). The panel also adopts the ALJ’s
discussion and analysis on pages 8-18 of the Proposed Decision. Dr. Baltatzis does not dispute
the accuracy of the ALJ’s proposed findings of fact, including findings that he turned 66 on May
10, 2017; that his medical practice remained open in June, July, and August, 2017; that he hired
another physician in June 2017 to provide coverage for patients in the practice; that his office
staff continued to work at his medical practice and called prescriptions into pharmacies for
patients during July and August, 2017; and that he treated patients at the practice and wrote
prescriptions for them in August 2017. Nor does he dispute the ALJ’s conclusions that he failed
to permanently close his practice in May 2017, and that he violated the 2015 Consent Order. He
does take exception to certain rulings and parts of the Proposed Decision.

CONSIDERATION OF EXCEPTIONS

First, Dr. Baltatzis excepts to the ALJ’s finding that his hiring of another physician to
provide care to his patients after June 1, 2017 was a violation of the 2015 Consent Order. He
argues that Board staff did not inform him that his employment arrangement with this physician
was non-compliant with the Consent Order during their visit on June 13, 2017, and that he
believed he was compliant at that time. A determination of non-compliance with a Board order is
a duty assigned to Board disciplinary panels, however, not to Board staff conducting an
investigation or visits to a physician’s office location. As Dr. Baltatzis pointed out, through his

counsel at the hearing, Board staff gather evidence, they do not make ultimate determinations

8
based on the evidence - the Board does. (T. 303.) His argument to the contrary at this point is
self-contradictory. In any event, as the ALJ found, the relevant question was the undisputed fact
of the physician’s employment by Dr. Baltatzis to treat patients at the practice in June 2017. That
fact supported a finding that Dr. Baltatzis’s private practice was still open in June 2017 due to his
failure to permanently close the practice as required in May 2017, when he reached the age of
66.' The panel agrees. By hiring the physician to see patients throughout most of June 2017, ata
practice that Dr. Baltatzis had agreed to close in May 2017, Dr. Baltatzis violated the 2015
Consent Order. Panel B rejects this exception.

Second, Dr. Baltatzis contends that the ALJ’s findings omit any reference to witness
testimony that his staff handed out referrals directing his patients to other primary care
physicians in May and that he continued to employ two staff members from June through August
2017 so they could refer patients and transmit patient records. This contention does not provide
support for Dr. Baltatzis.2 There was no dispute that Dr. Baltatzis retained staff members to
accomplish patient referrals and records transmission tasks while the practice remained open
after May 31, 2017, despite the 2015 Consent Order’s requirement that he permanently close his
practice. As the evidence showed, Dr. Baltatzis’s staff continued those tasks for months after the
requisite closure date of his practice because he did not timely initiate the crucial responsibilities
of notifying and transitioning patients and transmitting records. Dr. Baltatzis acknowledged on
cross examination that closing a practice takes some time, that patients have to be notified, that a

lot of things have to be done, and that the Consent Order gave him 18 months to close his

 

' The ALJ noted that a strict reading of the Consent Order, as written, held that Dr. Baltatzis’s practice should have
been permanently closed when he reached the age of 66 on May 10, 2017. In the ALJ’s view, by treating the Order
as though it required closure of the practice by May 31, 2017, the State’s generous reading of the Order was even
more favorable to Dr. Baltatzis, because it gave him an additional twenty-one days to permanently close his practice,
The panel will not modify the State’s reading of the 2015 Consent Order.

practice, He also conceded that he was late in doing so, and did not begin to notify patients of the
closure until mid-May 2017. (T. 408, 439, 444.) Dr. Baltatzis further testified that because the
physician he employed would be coming to work at the practice, he was not in a hurry to send
patient notices out because “we were not going to close the office.” (T. 449.) Even more
concerning, the evidence overwhelmingly showed that he not only kept his practice open and
operational, but engaged in the practice of medicine by seeing, examining, and treating Patients
A and E, and writing CDS prescriptions for Patients A, B, and E in August 2017. Patients
continued to obtain prescriptions in July and August strictly because Dr. Baltatzis’s practice was
still open, in violation of the 2015 Consent Order.

Panel B also finds that Dr. Baltatzis engaged in the practice of medicine by completing
and signing medical authorization forms for Patients C and D in August 2017. The purpose of the
form for Patient C was to enable an airline’s assessment of the patient’s fitness for plane travel
due to his need for portable oxygen. The form not only required Dr, Baltatzis’s signature as the
patient’s attending physician, but his knowledge of the patient’s medical data and detailed
medical diagnosis, the application of that knowledge to specify that the required oxygen flow
rate was 1.5 liters per minute via nasal cannula, and his consideration of the patient’s current
medical stability and prognosis for the flight. The recertification form for Patient D required Dr.
Baltatzis to assess the patient’s progress with and continuing need for a CPAP? machine to enable
continued CPAP treatment because of the patient’s diagnosis of sleep apnea. The panel rejects
Dr. Baltatzis’s contention that his actions merely involved the completion of paperwork. Rather,
his undertaking of those tasks on behalf of Patients C and D involved his knowledge of their

respective medical histories and his diagnosis of their medical ailments to ensure continued
