ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION

Disciplinary Panel A (“Panel A”) of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the
“Board”) hereby SUMMARILY SUSPENDS the license of DANIEL D, DIETRICK,
M.D. (the “Respondent”), License Number D45331, to practice medicine in the State of
Maryland.

Panel A takes such action pursuant to its authority under Md. Code Ann., State
Gov’t § 10-226(c) (2021 Repl. Vol. & 2023 Supp.), and Md. Code Regs. (“COMAR”)
10.32.02.08B(7), concluding that the public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires
emergency action.

INVESTIGATIVE FINDINGS

Based on information received by, and made known to Panel A, and the
investigatory information obtained by, received by and made known to and available to
Panel A, including the instances described below, Panel A has reason to believe that the

following facts are true: !

‘ The statements regarding Panel A’s investigative findings are intended to provide the Respondent with
reasonable notice of the basis of the suspension. They are not intended as, and do not necessarily represent,
a complete description of the evidence, either documentary or testimonial, to be offered against the
Respondent in connection with this matter.
 

L. BACKGROUND

1. At all times relevant hereto, the Respondent was and is licensed to practice
medicine in the State of Maryland. The Respondent initially was licensed to practice
medicine in Maryland on November 24, 1993, under License Number D45331. The
Respondent’s license expires on September 30, 2024, subject to renewal.

2. The Respondent is board-certified in Urology.

3, At all times relevant hereto, the Respondent was employed as a physician at
a health care facility (the “Facility’”) located in Towson, Maryland.

4, On or about October 5, 2023, the Board opened an investigation of the
Respondent after receiving a Mandated 10-Day Report from the Facility stating that on
September 13, 2023, it summarily suspended the Respondent’s Facility privileges based
on the Respondent testing positive for an elevated blood alcohol level on August 28, 2023,
after performing a procedure on a patient.

II. BOARD INVESTIGATION

5. As part of its investigation, the Board obtained medical and administrative
records from the Facility and other health care facilities with which the Respondent was
employed or associated. The Board also obtained a written response from the Respondent.

6. The Board’s investigation revealed that on or about August 28, 2023, the
Respondent was scheduled to perform a medical procedure on a patient at the Facility at
9:00 a.m. By 9:40 a.m. the Respondent had not arrived at the Facility, which prompted a

staff member to contact him. The Respondent finally arrived at the Facility at 9:53 a.m.
 

7. Upon the Respondent’s arrival, Facility staff members observed the
Respondent to be disheveled with the bottom of his pant leg tucked into his sock, his hair
unkempt and his shirt stained with deodorant. Facility staff members noticed the
Respondent’s speech was disjointed and slow. The Respondent proceeded to perform the
scheduled procedure and was observed to be “hyperfocused on each step of the procedure,
as if he was trying to remember what was to come next.” The Respondent performed the
procedure without any issues, but a Facility staff observed him to be rude when speaking
with the patient.

8. The Facility administrative staff decided not to allow the Respondent to
perform anymore procedures after the first patient. While Facility staff members were
speaking with the Respondent about his behavior in a consulting room, the Respondent
began retching and vomiting.

9. At approximately 1:00 p.m., the Respondent was driven by a Facility staff
member to another health care facility where he submitted a blood test for toxicology
screening. The result of the toxicology screening indicated that the Respondent was
impaired with an elevated blood alcohol content.

10. On or about October 20, 2023, the Respondent submitted a written response
to the Board in which he admitted to drinking more alcohol than he thought the night before
the stated incident on August 28, 2023, and also admitted that his blood alcohol level was

elevated on that date.
