’ The statements regarding the Respondent's conduct are intended to provide the Respondent with notice

Maryland on or about February 15, 1983, and his license is presently active
through September 30, 2018.

The Respondent practices internal medicine.

The Respondent has a lengthy disciplinary history with the Board. Pursuant to
an April 4, 1994 Consent Order, a March 22, 2005 Final Order and Opinion, an
October 20, 2009 Final Decision and Order and a November 5, 2015 Consent
Order, the Respondent has been required to successfully complete numerous
remedial courses including but not limited to: Controlled Dangerous Substances
(“CDS”) prescribing; polypharmacy; diabetes management and _ related
comorbidities; and multiple medical record keeping courses. The Respondent
has further been required to have a Board-approved physician monitor his
practice (2009) and has been subject to approximately eight chart or peer
reviews in which it was found that he failed to meet the standard of quality care
and failed to keep adequate medical records.

On May 14, 2015, Disciplinary Panel A charged the Respondent with violating a
condition of probation set forth in the October 20, 2009 Final Decision and Order.
Specifically, the Board charged the Respondent with violating the condition that
required him to meet the standard of care for the delivery of quality medical
services.

Effective November 5, 2015, the Respondent entered into a Consent Order to
resolve the Board’s charges.

Under the terms and conditions of the 2015 Consent Order, the Respondent was

reprimanded. The requirements of the Consent Order further provided:
ORDERED that the Respondent shall permanently close his
practice in May 2017, when he reaches age 66. The Respondent shall
provide to the Panel written documentation of the office closure; and it is
further

ORDERED that the Respondent shall not accept any new patients
to his practice at any time; and it is further

ORDERED that the Respondent shall remain on probation for the
entire duration of his licensure[.]

7. Disciplinary Panel A has received information that the Respondent has violated
the 2015 Consent Order. Specifically, Disciplinary Panel A’s investigation has
revealed that the Respondent continues to treat patients at his practice
subsequent to May 2017. The investigation further revealed that subsequent to
May 2017, the Respondent continues to renew prescriptions and write new
prescriptions for his private practice patients. The Respondent has written

numerous prescriptions for CDS and non-CDS medications.

Based on the foregoing facts, the Board concludes that the public health, safety
