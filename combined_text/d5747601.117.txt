Case No.: 2017-0162
License No.: D57476

Dear Dr. Dickinson and Mr. Gilbert:

On December 28, 2016, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of
Physicians issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO
PRACTICE MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-
226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl. Vol.). On January 11, 2017, Disciplinary Panel A held an initial
post-deprivation hearing, giving Dr. Dickinson an opportunity to argue why the summary
suspension should not continue. Dr. Dickinson attended the hearing without counsel. The
State was represented by Robert Gilbert, Assistant Attorney General, Administrative
Prosecutor. Dr. Dickinson submitted a letter to the Board prior to the hearing, which was
considered by Disciplinary Panel A. Both parties were permitted to present oral arguments at
the hearing.

Disciplinary Panel A of the Board, having considered the presentation of the parties
and relevant material, finds that the public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires the
summary suspension to continue. See State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2)(i). (2014 Repl. Vol.).

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Dr. Dickinson has the right to request a full evidentiary hearing before an
Administrative Law Judge. This request will be granted if the Board receives a written
request for the hearing within ten days of the date of this letter. The request for a hearing
shall be sent to Christine Farrelly, Executive Director, at 4201 Patterson Avenue, Baltimore,

request, see COMAR 10.32.02.081, though you may waive that 30-day requirement.

disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely yours,
