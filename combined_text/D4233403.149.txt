Case No.: 2219-0016A
License No.: D42334

Dear Dr. Jalali and Counsel:

On March 8, 2019, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann.,
State Gov’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl. Vol.).

On March 13, 2019, Disciplinary Panel A held a post deprivation hearing to show cause
why that suspension should not be continued. Neither you, or your counsel, Robert Maynard,
Esq, attended the hearing on that date on your behalf. Mr. Maynard sent a message to Ms. Brown
and to the Board’s Executive Director informing them that you would not be attending the post
deprivation hearing. The State was represented by Janet Brown, Assistant Attorney General,
Administrative Prosecutor. Ms. Brown presented oral arguments at the hearing on behalf of the
State.

After considering Ms. Brown’s arguments at the hearing and the investigative file,
Disciplinary Panel A determined that it would continue the summary suspension imposed on
March 8, 2019. Disciplinary Panel A thus will not lift the summary suspension order.

Disciplinary Panel A finds that the public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires the
suspension of Dr. Jalali’s license. See State Gov’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i). The order of summary

Kuchak Jalali, M.D. Summary Suspension Letter
March 14, 2019

suspension is thus reaffirmed and continues. See COMAR 10.32.02.08H(1). Disciplinary Panel
A, through its counsel, advised the administrative prosecutor of this decision orally on the
hearing date.

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, Dr. Jalali has the right to request a full evidentiary hearing
before an Administrative Law Judge at the Office of Administrative Hearings. To receive the
evidentiary hearing, Dr. Jalali or his counsel must file the request for the hearing within TEN
(10) days of the date of this letter. The request for a hearing should be sent to Christine Farrelly,
Executive Director, at the Board’s address. If the hearing is timely requested, the regulations
require that an Administrative Law Judge set the hearing to begin within 30 days of the request,
see COMAR 10.32.02.08I, though that 30-day time period may be waived.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel A resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely yours,
