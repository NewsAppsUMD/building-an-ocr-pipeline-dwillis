II. BOARD INVESTIGATION

3. In or around September 2017, the Board initiated an investigation of the
Respondent after receiving information that a Maryland health care facility (the “Facility”!
revoked his clinical privileges based on his failure to disclose that he had been indicted on
federal criminal charges.

4. As part of its investigation, the Board reviewed the Respondent’s 2017 on-
line renewal application (the “Application”), submitted on August 28, 2017, to determine
if he disclosed this information in the Application.

5. Inthe section of the Application titled Character and Fitness, the Respondent
was instructed to answer “YES” or “NO” to a series of questions pertaining to events
occurring since July 1, 2015 and provide written explanations for all “YES” responses.

6. The Respondent answered “NO” to all of the Character and Fitness questions
posed, including the following:

QUESTION 6(f): Has a hospital, related health care facility, HMO,
or alternative health care system denied your application for
privileges, or failed to renew your privileges, including your
privileges as a resident; or limited, restricted, suspended, or revoked
your privileges in any way?

QUESTION 6(i): Are there any charges pending against you in any

court of law, are you currently under arrest, released pending trial with
or without bond, or is there an outstanding warrant for your arrest?

' For confidentiality reasons, the name of any health care facility referenced herein will not be disclosed in
this document. The Respondent may obtain the identity of any health care facility referenced in this
document by contacting the assigned administrative prosecutor.
7. At the conclusion of the Application, the Respondent certified that he
personally reviewed all of the responses he made in the Application and that the
information he provided therein was true and correct. The Application notified the
Respondent that any false information he provided may be cause for the denial of his
Application.

8. By letter dated September 11, 2017, the Board informed the Respondent that
it had initiated an investigation of him based on his alleged failure to disclose in his
Application that he had been indicted on federal criminal charges and that a health care
facility had revoked his clinical privileges. The Board requested that the Respondent
address these non-disclosures in a written response.

9. By letter to the Board dated September 27, 2017, the Respondent
acknowledged that when filing his Application, he failed to disclose that he had been
indicted in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, under Case
Number 1:16-cr-00324-MJG-2, with the commission of criminal offenses; and that the
Facility had revoked his hospital privileges. The Respondent variously claimed that his
non-disclosures were “a mistake, actually three,” and that he “simply dropped the ball.”
The Respondent provided a copy of the criminal indictment with his response and reported
that his criminal trial was scheduled to commence on October 10, 2017. The Respondent
also disclosed that he failed to disclose that he was no longer permitted to bill for services
to patients who had insurance coverage through a specific insurance carrier.

10. The Board’s investigation confirmed that on or about June 28, 2016, the

Respondent, under Case Number 1:16-cr-00324-MLG-2, was charged in the United States
District Court for the District of Maryland pursuant to a multi-count indictment (the
“Indictment”) with violating the federal Anti-Kickback Act, committing health care fraud
and related unlawful acts.

11. Specifically, the Indictment charged the Respondent with: violating the federal
Anti-Kickback Act, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b; receiving unlawful
remuneration in violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Act (a violation of 42 U.S.C. §
1320a-7b); conspiracy to defraud the Internal Revenue Service (a violation of 18 U.S.C.
§ 371); health care fraud (a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1347); and making false statements
relating to health care matters (a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1035(a)(1) and (a)(2)). In 2017,
federal authorities issued a superseding indictment (the “Superseding Indictment”) that
superseded the Indictment.

12. The Board’s investigation confirmed that the Facility temporarily suspended the
Respondent’s clinical privileges on December 16, 2016, based on his failure to report the
Indictment, and that after he failed to provide further information to the Facility upon its
request, the Facility revoked his medical staff membership and clinical privileges,
effective March 17, 2017.

13. At the time the Respondent submitted his Application, he knew that federal
authorities had indicted him on criminal charges and that the Facility had revoked his
medical staff membership. The Respondent had an obligation to disclose these facts on
his Application but failed to do so.

14. The Respondent pleaded not guilty to the charges alleged in the Superseding

Indictment and prayed a jury trial in the United States District Court for the District of
Maryland, which commenced on October 10, 2017. Prior to the commencement of the
trial, the United State’s Attorney’s Office withdrew Count Fifteen (15) and severed Count

Eighteen (18) from the Superseding Indictment.

15. On October 27, 2017, a federal jury found the Respondent guilty of the
following counts of the Superseding Indictment: Count One (1), which charged him with
conspiracy to violate the Anti-Kickback Act and the Travel Act (a violation of 18 U.S.C.
§ 371); Counts Two (2) through Thirteen (13), which charged him with soliciting and
receiving illegal health care-related kickbacks (a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-
7b(b)(1)(A)); Counts Fourteen (14), Sixteen (16) and Seventeen (17), charging him with
violating the Travel Act (a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1952(a)(1) and (3)); Counts Nineteen
(19) through Twenty-Four (24), charging him with health care fraud (a violation of 18
U.S.C. § 1347); and Counts Twenty-Five (25) through Twenty-Seven (27), charging him
with making false statements relating to health care matters (a violation of 18 U.S.C. §
1035(a)(1) and (a)(2)).

Ill. DISCIPLINARY CHARGES, NOVEMBER 28, 2017

16. On November 28, 2017, Disciplinary Panel B issued disciplinary charges
(“Charges”) against the Respondent, alleging that his failure to provide true and correct
responses on his Application constituted the following violations of the Act under Health
Occ. § 14-404(a): (1) Fraudulently or deceptively obtains or attempts to obtain a license
for the applicant or licensee or for another; (3) Is guilty of: (ii) Unprofessional conduct in

the practice of medicine; (11) Willfully makes or files a false report or record in the
practice of medicine; and (36) Willfully makes a false representation when seeking or
making application for licensure or any other application related to the practice of

medicine.

IV. PROPOSED DEFAULT ORDER, OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE
HEARINGS, MAY 15, 2018

17. The Board referred the Charges to the Office of Administrative Hearings
(“OAH”) for adjudication. On April 13, 2018, the OAH issued written notice to the parties
that it would convene a scheduling conference on May 4, 2018. OAH sent the notices to
the State, the Respondent and his attorney of record at their addresses of record.

18. On May 4, 2018, an administrative law judge (“ALJ”) with the OAH convened
the scheduling conference. A representative of the State appeared. Neither the
Respondent nor his attorney of record appeared. The OAH found that it had provided
proper service to the Respondent and issued a Proposed Default Order, dated May 15,
2018. Pursuant to the Proposed Default Order, the ALJ proposed that: the Respondent
be held in default; the Board accept as fact the statements set forth in the Allegations of
Fact section of the Charges; the Board conclude as a matter of law that the Respondent
violated the Act under Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(1), (3)(ii) and (36) in the manner set forth
in the Charges; and the Board impose any disciplinary action against the Respondent that
it finds appropriate.

19. In a written filing dated May 31, 2018, the Respondent took Exception to the
Proposed Default Order. In a written filing dated June 8, 2018, the State responded to the

Respondent’s Exceptions.
Vv. PLEA AGREEMENT, JUNE 25, 2018
20. On June 25, 2018, the Respondent entered into a written plea agreement (the
“Plea Agreement”) with the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Maryland
in which he agreed to plead guilty to Count Eighteen (18) of the Superseding Indictment,
which charged him with Conspiracy to Defraud the United States (a violation of 18 U.S.C.
§ 371). The Respondent stipulated to a statement of facts in support of the Plea
Agreement.
VI. DISCIPLINARY PANEL ORDER, AUGUST 22, 2018
21. On August 8, 2018, Disciplinary Panel A convened an Exceptions hearing.
Because a criminal proceeding against the Respondent was progressing (see {| 20 above),
Disciplinary Panel A deferred action on the pending administrative case to consolidate it
with the administrative action anticipated from the disposition of the criminal proceeding.
VII. SENTENCING IN FEDERAL COURT, SEPTEMBER 11, 2018
22. On June 25, 2018, the Respondent pleaded guilty to Count Eighteen (18) of
the Superseding Indictment, Conspiracy to Defraud the United States (a violation of 18
U.S.C. § 371). On September 11, 2018, the Respondent appeared for sentencing in the
United States District Court for the District of Maryland and was sentenced to the June 25,
2018, charge and the charges for which he was previously found guilty by a jury on October
27, 2017, i.e., Counts One (1), Two (2) through Fourteen (14), Sixteen (16), Seventeen
(17), and Nineteen (19) through Twenty-Seven (27), as follows: Sixty (60) months
incarceration as to Counts One (1) through Fourteen (14), Sixteen (16) through Eighteen

(18), and Twenty-Five (25) through Twenty-Seven (27), to run concurrently with each
Seventeen (17), and Nineteen (19) through Twenty-Seven (27), as follows: Sixty (60)
months incarceration as to Counts One (1) through Fourteen (14), Sixteen (16) through
Eighteen (18), and Twenty-Five (25) through Twenty-Seven (27), to run concurrently
with each other; and Ninety-Six (96) months incarceration as to Counts Nineteen through
Twenty-Four (24), to run concurrently with each other, and concurrent with Counts One
(1) through Fourteen (14), Sixteen (16) through Eighteen (18), and Twenty-Five (25)
through Twenty-Seven (27). The Respondent was also ordered to be placed on
supervised release for three (3) years after completing his imprisonment; and was ordered
to pay restitution totaling $1,332,712; a fine totaling $75,000; and an assessment totaling
$2600.’
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Panel A concludes as a matter of law that
the Respondent violated the following provisions of the Act under Health Occ. § 14-
404(a): (1) Fraudulently or deceptively obtains or attempts to obtain a license for the
applicant or licensee or for another; (3) Is guilty of: (ii) Unprofessional conduct in the
practice of medicine; (11) Willfully makes or files a false report or record in the practice
of medicine; and (36) Willfully makes a false representation when seeking or making
