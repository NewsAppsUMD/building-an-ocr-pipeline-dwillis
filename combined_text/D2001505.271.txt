Case No.: 2221-0078
License No.: D20015

Dear Dr. Mohiuddin and Counsel:

On May 14, 2021, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued
an ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE in
this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl. Vol.). On May
26, 2021, Dr. Mohiuddin was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing before
Disciplinary Panel B to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. Dr. Mohiuddin
attended the hearing on that date and was represented by counsel, Matthew Fogelson, Esquire.
The State was represented by Gregory Lockwood, Assistant Attorney General, Administrative
Prosecutor. Both parties presented oral arguments at the post-deprivation hearing.

After considering these arguments at the hearing and the investigative file, Disciplinary
Panel B determined, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the health, welfare, and safety of
the public imperatively required the disciplinary panel to summarily suspend Dr. Mohiuddin’s
license and that there exists a substantial risk of serious harm to the public health, safety or
welfare in Dr. Mohiuddin’s continued practice. Disciplinary Panel B thus will not lift the

summary suspension order and the summary suspension imposed on May 14, 2021 is reaffirmed
and continues. See COMAR 10.32.02.08H(1).

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, Dr. Mohiuddin has the right to request a full evidentiary
hearing before an Administrative Law Judge at the Office of Administrative Hearings. This
request will be granted if the Board receives a written request for the hearing within TEN (10)
days of the date of this letter. Any request for a hearing should be sent to Christine A. Farrelly,
Executive Director, at the Board’s address. If Dr. Mohiuddin requests such a hearing, the
regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set the hearing to begin within 30 days of
the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08I, though Dr. Mohiuddin may waive that 30-day
requirement.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel B resulting from

formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely yours,

Signature on File

Christine A. Farrelly, Executive Dist
Maryland State Board of Physicians
