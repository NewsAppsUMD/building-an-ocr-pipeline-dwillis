CONSENT ORDER
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

The Maryland Board of Physicians (the “Maryland Board”) received information
that Vinson DiSanto, DO, (the “Respondent”) License Number H72057, was disciplined
by the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure (the “Kentucky Board”). In an Order dated
March 19, 2019, the Kentucky Board restricted the Respondent from prescribing,
dispensing, or professionally utilizing controlled substances.

Based on the above referenced Kentucky Board sanction, the Maryland Board has
grounds to charge the Respondent with violating the following provisions of the
Maryland Medical Practice Act (the “Act”), under H. O. § 14-404(a):

(a) Subject to the hearing provisions of § 14-405 of this subtitle, a

disciplinary panel, on the affirmative vote of a majority of the quorum
of the disciplinary panel, may reprimand any licensee, place any
licensee on probation, or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee:
(21) Is disciplined by a licensing or disciplinary

authority or convicted or disciplined by a court of

any state or country or disciplined by any branch of

the United States uniformed services or the

Veteran’s Administration for an act that would be

grounds for disciplinary action under this section,

The Maryland Board has determined that the acts for which the Respondent was

disciplined by the Kentucky Board would be grounds for disciplinary action under H.O. §
14-404(a). The underlying grounds for disciplinary action under H.O. § 14-404(a) are as
follows:

(4) Is professionally, physically, or mentally incompetent;

(22) Fails to meet appropriate standards as determined by appropriate peer
review for the delivery of quality medical and surgical care performed in
any outpatient surgical facility, office, hospital, or any other location in
this State.

Based on the action taken by the Kentucky Board, the Respondent agrees to enter
into this Consent Order with the Maryland Board of Physicians, consisting of Procedural
Background, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and disciplinary Order.

I. FINDINGS OF FACT
The Board finds the following:

1. At all times relevant hereto, the Respondent was a physician licensed to
practice medicine in the State of Maryland. The Respondent was initially licensed in
Maryland on or about April 5, 2011.

2. In an Emergency Order of Restriction, dated March 19, 2019, the
Kentucky Board found that the Respondent failed to conform to acceptable and
prevailing medical practices, and in one instance, demonstrated gross negligence by
prescribing controlled substances without medical necessity.

3. Under Agreement with the Kentucky Board, the Respondent submitted to
a clinical skills assessment at the Center for Personalized Education for Professionals
(“CPEP”).

4. CPEP found that the Respondent’s overall knowledge and judgment in the

broad scope of general family medicine was outdated and that it would not be safe for the
intermittent headache and nausea, which he diagnosed as either stress or
environmental toxins, without considering other possible gastrointestinal,
neurologic or functional possibilities.

In the review of charts submitted, Dr. DiSanto was noted to show several
judgment errors in his management of men with presumed hormonal issues,
most commonly diagnosed as hypogonadism. For example, although he was
able to describe a relatively complete history, examination, and laboratory
investigation, the consultants noted that his actual patient charis often
demonstrated lapses in this protocol, such as failure to consistently check a
DHEA, estradiol, or FSH/LH level. He did not check for secondary
hypogonadism when both testosterone and LH were noted to be low. He did
not alter the dose of testosterone when polycythemia was noted in one chart.
In another chart where the testosterone was abnormally high, he added HCG
instead of decreasing the dose of testosterone. With another patient
complaining of weakness and lethargy who was on alprazolam, bupropion,
and fluoxetine, he did not investigate the role of the underlying illness or
medications in these symptoms or the possibility of suicidal or homicidal
ideation, but started him on testosterone, HCG, and Oxandrolone despite
normal testosterone level five months prior (while off all hormones).

16. CPEP reviewed patient charts from Dr. DiSanto’s actual practice, as well as notes written
by him at CPEP during simulated patient encounters, and found that his actual patient care

documentation was poor and his simulated patient encounter documentation to be

inadequate, stating in part,

+» Dr. DiSanto’s patient care documentation was poor. His documentation
contained the basic elements of a medical record, but the notes were
incomplete, lacked sufficient detail in the Subjective and Objective
components, and failed to provide any justification for the subsequent
assessment and plan. There was little internal consistency between the
various components such as lab results and the objective or assessment notes.
One consultant specifically stated that he could not assume effective care of
any of the patients abased on these medical records.

Overall, Dr. DiSanto’s SP [simulated patient] documentation was inadequate.
He demonstrated that he understood some of the components of acceptable
single-encounter patient documentation, but did not provide adequate
information about the overall medical context in which the SP presented. In
addition, he did not provide sufficient information in the HPI and review of
systems to effectively support a diagnosis or narrow a differential diagnosis.
His assessments were generally appropriate for the information obtained, but
17,

his plans were non-specific in the use of medications or any counseling
regarding such medications.

By his conduct, the licensee has violated KRS 31 1.595(9), as illustrated by KRS 311.597(3)

and (4). Accordingly, legal grounds exist for disciplinary action against his Kentucky

osteopathic license.

. The licensee is directed to respond to the allegations delineated in the Complaint within

thirty (30) days of service thereof and is further given notice that:
(a) His failure to respond may be taken as an admission of the charges;

(b) He may appear alone or with counsel, may cross-examine all prosecution
witnesses and offer evidence in his defense.

- NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that a hearing on this Complaint is scheduled for September

September 24, 25 & 26, 2019, at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Standard Time, at the Kentucky Board
of Medical Licensure, Hurstbourne Office Park, 310 Whittington Parkway, Suite 1B,
Louisville, Kentucky 40222. Said hearing shall be held pursuant to the Rules and
Regulations of the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure and pursuant to KRS Chapter
13B. This hearing shall proceed as scheduled and the hearing date shall only be modified
by leave of the Hearing Officer upon a showing of good cause,

WHEREFORE, Complainant prays that appropriate disciplinary action be taken against

the license to practice osteopathy held by VINSON M. DiSANTO, D.O.

This 19" day of March, 2019.

EMERGENCY ORDER OF RESTRICTION

 

The Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure (hereafter “the Board”), acting by and through
its Inquiry Pane! A, considered this matter at its February 21, 2019, meeting. At that meeting the
Panel considered memoranda by Jon Marshall, Medical Investi gator, dated February 20, 2018 and
February 7, 2019; a memorandum by Michael S. Rodman, Executive Director, dated August 4,
2017; Idaho State Board of Medicine Stipulation and Order, dated June 2, 2017; the licensee’s
explanation of the Idaho Order, received June 9, 2017; a compliance letter from Darlene Parrott,
CMBI, Compliance Monitor, State of Idaho Board of Medicine, dated July 11, 2017;
correspondence from the licensee, dated July 16, 2017; a copy of the prescription to “Patient B.A.”
from the licensee, dated July 26, 2016; a Board consultant report, along with Expert Review
Worksheets, dated January 2018; the licensee’s response to the Board consultant’s report, dated
February 11, 2018; the Board consultant’s final response, dated February 14, 2018; the Interim
Agreed Order (Diversion), filed of record May 3, 2018; Center for Personalized Education for
Professionals (CPEP) Assessment Report, dated February 6, 2019; and a Neuropsychological
Evaluation prepared by W. Kent Hicks, Ed.D., Raskin & Associates, dated January 14, 2019.

Having considered all of this information and being sufficiently advised, Inquiry Panel A

ENTERS the following EMERGENCY ORDER OF RESTRICTION, in accordance with KRS
311.592(1) and 13B.125(1):
FINDINGS OF FACT

 

Pursuant to KRS 13B.125(2) and based upon the information available to it, Inquiry Panel

A concludes there is probable cause to make the following Findings of Fact, which support its

Emergency Order of Restriction:

1.

At all relevant times, Vinson M. DiSanto, D.O., was licensed by the Board to practice
osteopathy within the Commonwealth of Kentucky.

The licensee’s osteopathic specialty is family medicine.

In or around 2010, the licensee was issued a license to practice osteopathy in the
Commonwealth of Kentucky contingent upon him entering into an Agreed Order of Fine
based upon his non-disclosure of his dismissal from osteopathic school for academic
reasons,

On or about June 2, 2017, the licensee entered into a Stipulation and Order with the Idaho
State Board of Medicine, pursuant to which he was reprimanded and fined, based upon his
prescribing of testosterone, a controlled substance, to Idaho patients via email and
telephone, without having obtained required registrations through the Idaho Board of
Pharmacy and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to issue prescriptions to

patients located in Idaho.

. An investigation into the licensee’s practices in the Commonwealth of Kentucky via

telemedicine and a KASPER review disclosed four (4) patients having received controlled
substance prescriptions from the licensee in Kentucky.
The licensee produced three (3) patient charts in response to a Board subpoena for the four

(4) patient charts. The licensee denied that he treated the fourth patient (“Patient BA”) or

had a chart on Patient BA.

tw
7.

10.

11.

12.

A copy of the prescription to Patient BA was obtained and showed that it was written under
the licensee’s name, with a New Jersey address. Patient BA’s address was listed as being
in Utah, but the prescription was delivered to a UPS store in Murray, Kentucky.

A Board consultant reviewed the three (3) patient charts produced by the licensee and
opined that the licensee failed to conform to acceptable and prevailing medical practices in
the Commonwealth of Kentucky and, in one instance, demonstrated gross negligence by
prescribing controlled substances without medical necessity.

On or about February 11 2018, the licensee responded that he had made a number of
changes in his practice, including that he decreased overprescribed medications to one
patient and made personnel changes. The licensee stated, in part, that “when compliance
issues became apparent to me, I discontinued care to the patients and have since made
personnel changes which has repaired this flaw. Kentucky was never planned as an area
of focus for Anti-Aging Medicine, and this activity has been discontinued since 2016,”
Upon this information, the Board consultant opined that until his current practices can be
evaluated, his prescribing be monitored if he maintains an active Kentucky medical license.
In or around November 2018, under agreement with the Board, the licensee submitted to a
clinical skills assessment at Center for Personalized Education for Professionals (“CPEP”)
in the specialty of family medicine, with a focus on adult hormone deficiency.

CPEP found that the licensee’s overall knowledge and judgment in the broad scope of
general family medicine was outdated and in need of updating and review and opined that
these needs would best be addressed through remediation in a formal educational setting

such as residency, fellowship or residency-like setting. According to CPEP, this level of
13

recommendation indicates that it would not be safe for this physician to practice

independently while attempting to remediate the noted deficiencies.

. In addition, CPEP found the licensee’s knowledge and judgment in his focus area of male

hypogonadism (adult hormone deficiency) to be inadequate; that the level of educational
needs in this area would require oversight and supervision; and recommended that
remediation in his focus area of adult hormone deficiency be addressed after remediation

of foundational knowledge in his primary specialty, family medicine.

. In regard to the licensee’s medical knowledge, CPEP found that the licensee demonstrated

“significant educational needs,” stating in part

... although he was able to describe the common symptoms of asthma and
appropriate treatment for a mild case, he was not able to correctly describe
the recommended management of increasingly severe asthma. He was
unaware of the current recommendations for administration of Prevnar and
Pneumovax in adults. In discussing various urology topics, he described
screening for prostate cancer with a digital rectal exam and prostate-specific
antigen (PSA) test, both of which are no longer recommended. He recalled
only one of the medications used for management of prostatic hypertrophy
symptoms. When presented with a young male with flank pain and meaturia,
he correctly identified the possibility of a ureteral stone, but was unable to
describe the various crystalline forms of stones or their specific treatment. In
discussing care of the elderly, he indicated that he would use a tricyclic
antidepresessant (amitriptyline) or trazadone for insomnia, both of which are
relatively contraindicated in this age group. Similarly, he recommended use
of anticholinergic medications to manage urinary incontinence in the elderly,
but was unware of the significant risk of side effects. He described few
measures used to decrease the risk of falls in the elderly.

.. In treating a hypothetical male patient with hypogonadism (symptoms of
fatigue, decreased libido and erectile dysfunction), but a normal testosterone
level, Dr. DiSanto recommended treatment with testosterone with added HCG
and occasionally Oxandrolone, which is not the current standard of care in
allopathic or functional medicine. ... Additionally, when asked about
hormonal replacement in women, he was not able to clearly describe the
diagnostic criteria for female menopause, and incorrectly stated that the
USPSTF guidelines currently recommend estrogen supplementation in the
post-menopausal period for osteoporosis, vaginal dryness, and climacteric
issues, He was not aware of the risk of endometrial/uterine cancer with
unopposed estrogen therapy, and would not use progesterone
supplementation because of its androgenic side effects, which is contrary to
current recommendations.

15. CPEP found that the licensee demonstrated “inadequate” clinical judgment and reasoning,

stating in part

.he did not demonstrate the ability to gather information in a logical,
organized, and complete fashion; his overall approach to many of the
hypothetical clinical cases appeared to be somewhat superficial and focused
only on the most commonly known symptoms and findings. For example,
when presented with a hypothetical case of a 45-year old female with
increasing fatigue and a history of apparent viral pharyngitis one year prior,
he inquired about the metabolic profile and thyroid level (which were normal)
and immediately diagnosed the problem as chronic fatigue syndrome. He did
not investigate other causes such as occult infection, lifestyle issues, chronic
anxiety, depression, drug or alcohol abuse or possible toxins. All consultants
that reviewed his charts noted a lack of adequate information in the history,
physical examination and laboratory investigation of many patients.

Dr. DiSanto demonstrated some difficulty recognizing acuity of illness, and
suggested less-than-appropriate plans, often ignoring known clinical evidence
of best practices. For example, in the hypothetical case of a 60-year old male
with polydipsia, polyuria, weight loss, and a blood glucose of 300, he initially
recommended lifestyle changes and a diet, without investigating other
possible comorbidities. When pressed, he suggested that he might add
Lisinopril and metformin, without recognizing that most probably a more
aggressive anti-glycemic regimen would be necessary. He rarely proposed a
differential diagnosis for a patient’s complex symptoms, such as in a
hypothetical young male starting a job in a new building and complaining of
intermittent headache and nausea, which he diagnosed as either stress or
environmental toxins, without considering other possible gastrointestinal,
neurologic or functional possibilities.

In the review of charts submitted, Dr. DiSanto was noted to show several
judgment errors in his management of men with presumed hormonal issues,
most commonly diagnosed as hypogonadism. For example, although he was
able to describe a relatively complete history, examination, and laboratory
investigation, the consultants noted that his actual patient charts often
demonstrated lapses in this protocol, such as failure to consistently check a
DHEA, estradiol, or FSH/LH level. He did not check for secondary
hypogonadism when both testosterone and LH were noted to be low. He did
not alter the dose of testosterone when polycythemia was noted in one chart.
In another chart where the testosterone was abnormally high, he added HCG
instead of decreasing the dose of testosterone. With another patient
complaining of weakness and lethargy who was on alprazolam, bupropion,
and fluoxetine, he did not investigate the role of the underlying illness or
medications in these symptoms or the possibility of suicidal or homicidal
ideation, but started him on testosterone, HCG, and Oxandrolone despite
normal testosterone level five months prior (while off all hormones).

16. CPEP reviewed patient charts from Dr. DiSanto’s actual practice, as well as notes written
by him at CPEP during simulated patient encounters, and found that his actual patient care

documentation was poor and his simulated patient encounter documentation to be

inadequate, stating in part,

... Dr. DiSanto’s patient care documentation was poor. His documentation
contained the basic elements of a medical record, but the notes were
incomplete, lacked sufficient detail in the Subjective and Objective
components, and failed to provide any justification for the subsequent
assessment and plan. There was little internal consistency between the
various components such as lab results and the objective or assessment notes.
One consultant specifically stated that he could not assume effective care of
any of the patients abased on these medical records.

Overall, Dr. DiSanto’s SP [simulated patient] documentation was inadequate.
He demonstrated that he understood some of the components of acceptable
single-encounter patient documentation, but did not provide adequate
information about the overall medical context in which the SP presented. In
addition, he did not provide sufficient information in the HPI and review of
systems to effectively support a diagnosis or narrow a differential diagnosis.
His assessments were generally appropriate for the information obtained, but
his plans were non-specific in the use of medications or any counseling
regarding such medications.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

 

Pursuant to KRS 13B.125(2) and based upon the information available to it, Inquiry Panel
A finds there is probable cause to support the following Conclusions of Law, which serve as the

legal bases for this Emergency Order of Restriction:

1. The licensee’s Kentucky osteopathic license is subject to regulation and discipline by this

Board.
» KRS 311.592(1) provides that the Board may issue an emergency order suspending,
limiting, or restricting a physician’s license at any time an inquiry panel has probable
cause to believe that a) the physician has violated the terms of an order placing him on
probation; or b) a physician’s practice constitutes a danger to the health, welfare and
safety of his patients or the general public.

There is probable cause to believe that the licensee has violated the provisions of KRS
311.595(9), as illustrated by KRS 31 1.597(3) and (4).

- The Panel concludes there is probable cause to believe this physician’s practice
constitutes a danger to the health, welfare and safety of his patients or the general public,

- The Board may draw logical and reasonable inferences about a physician’s practice by
considering certain facts about a physician’s practice. If there is proof that a physician
has violated a provision of the Kentucky Medical Practice Act in one set of
circumstances, the Board may infer that the physician will similarly violate the Medical
Practice Act when presented with a similar set of circumstances. Similarly, the Board
concludes that proof of a set of facts about a physician’s practice presents representative
proof of the nature of that physician’s practice in general. Accordingly, probable cause to
believe that the physician has committed certain violations in the recent past presents
probable cause to believe that the physician will commit similar violations in the near
future, during the course of the physician’s medical practice.

. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that it is no violation of the federal Due
Process Clause for a state agency to temporarily suspend a license, without a prior
evidentiary hearing, so long as 1) the immediate action is based upon a probable cause

finding that there is a present danger to the public safety; and, 2) the statute provides for a
Respondent to practice independently while attempting to remediate the noted
deficiencies.

5. By Emergency Order of Restriction dated March 19, 2019, the Kentucky
Board restricted the Respondent from prescribing, dispensing or professionally utilizing
controlled substances,

A copy of the Kentucky Board Order is attached hereto.

6. Based on the Kentucky Board Order, the Rhode Island Board of Medical
Licensure and Discipline summarily suspended the Respondent’s license and controlled
substance registration by Order dated April 25, 2019.

7. On June 26, 2019, the Alabama Board of Medical Examiners issued an
Order Temporarily Suspending License and Setting Hearing.

8. By Consent Order dated July 8, 2019, with the Arkansas State Medical
Board, the Respondent agreed to not practice medicine in the State of Arkansas until he
appears before the Board and agrees to follow any and all orders and decisions of the
Kentucky Board.

9. On August 21, 2019, the Virginia Department of Health Professions issued
an Order of Mandatory Suspension.

10. The New York State Board for Professional Medical Conduct issued an
Order of Summary Action on August 21, 2019.

Il. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW.

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, the Maryland Board concludes as a

matter of law that the disciplinary action taken by the Kentucky Board against the

Respondent was for an act or acts that would be grounds for disciplinary action under
prompt post-deprivation hearing. Barry v. Barchi, 443 U.S. 55, 61 L.Ed.2d 365, 99 S.Ct.

 

2642 (1979); FDIC v. Mallen, 486 U.S. 230, 100 L.Ed.2d 265, 108 S.Ct. 1780 (1988) and

Gilbert v. Homar, 117 S.Ct. 1807 (1997). C& KRS 13B.125(1).

 

KRS 13B.125(3) provides that the Board shall conduct an emergency hearing on
this emergency order within ten (10) working days of a request for such a hearing by the
licensee. The licensee has been advised of his right to a prompt post-deprivation hearing

under this statute.

IN RE: THE LICENSE TO PRACTICE OSTEOPATHY IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF
KENTUCKY HELD BY VINSON M. DiSANTO, D.O., LICENSE NO. 03250, 4428
LAKE BREEZE DRIVE, McKINNEY, TEXAS 75071
COMPLAINT
Comes now the Complainant Dale E. Toney, M.D., Chair of the Kentucky Board of
Medical Licensure’s Inquiry Panel A, and on behalf of the Panel which met on February 21, 2019,
states for its Complaint against the licensee, VINSON M. DiSANTO, M.D, as follows:

1. At all relevant times, Vinson M. DiSanto, D.O., was licensed by the Board to practice
osteopathy within the Commonwealth of Kentucky.

2. The licensee’s osteopathic specialty is family medicine.

3. In or around 2010, the licensee was issued a license to practice osteopathy in the
Commonwealth of Kentucky contingent upon him entering into an Agreed Order of Fine
based upon his non-disclosure of his dismissal from osteopathic school for academic
reasons.

4, On or about June 2, 2017, the licensee entered into a Stipulation and Order with the Idaho
State Board of Medicine, pursuant to which he was reprimanded and fined, based upon his
prescribing of testosterone, a controlled substance, to Idaho patients via email and
telephone, without having obtained required registrations through the Idaho Board of
Pharmacy and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to issue prescriptions to

patients located in Idaho.
10.

An investigation into the licensee’s practices in the Commonwealth of Kentucky via
telemedicine and a KASPER review disclosed four (4) patients having received controlled
substance prescriptions from the licensee in Kentucky.

The licensee produced three (3) patient charts in response to a Board subpoena for the four
(4) patient charts. The licensee denied that he treated the fourth patient (“Patient BA”) or
had a chart on Patient BA.

A copy of the prescription to Patient BA was obtained and showed that it was written under
the licensee’s name, with a New Jersey address. Patient BA’s address was listed as being
in Utah, but the prescription was delivered to a UPS store in Murray, Kentucky.

A Board consultant reviewed the three (3) patient charts produced by the licensee and
opined that the licensee failed to conform to acceptable and prevailing medical practices in
the Commonwealth of Kentucky and, in one instance, demonstrated gross negligence by
prescribing controlled substances without medical necessity.

On or about February 11 2018, the licensee responded that he had made a number of
changes in his practice, including that he decreased overprescribed medications to one
patient and made personnel changes, The licensee stated, in part, that “when compliance
issues became apparent to me, I discontinued care to the patients and have since made
personnel changes which has repaired this flaw. Kentucky was never planned as an area
of focus for Anti-Aging Medicine, and this activity has been discontinued since 2016.”
Upon this information, the Board consultant opined that until his current practices can be

evaluated, his prescribing be monitored if he maintains an active Kentucky medical license.

11. In or around November 2018, under agreement with the Board, the licensee submitted to a
clinical skills assessment at Center for Personalized Education for Professionals (“CPEP”)
in the specialty of family medicine, with a focus on adult hormone deficiency.

12. CPEP found that the licensee’s overall knowledge and judgment in the broad scope of
general family medicine was outdated and in need of updating and review and opined that
these needs would best be addressed through remediation in a formal educational setting
such as residency, fellowship or residency-like setting. According to CPEP, this level of
recommendation indicates that it would not be safe for this physician to practice
independently while attempting to remediate the noted deficiencies.

13. In addition, CPEP found the licensee’s knowledge and judgment in his focus area of male
hypogonadism (adult hormone deficiency) to be inadequate; that the level of educational
needs in this area would require oversight and supervision; and recommended that
remediation in his focus area of adult hormone deficiency be addressed after remediation
of foundational knowledge in his primary specialty, family medicine.

14, In regard to the licensee’s medical knowledge, CPEP found that the licensee demonstrated

“significant educational needs,” stating in part

.». although he was able to describe the common symptoms of asthma and
appropriate treatment for a mild case, he was not able to correctly describe
the recommended management of increasingly severe asthma. He was
unaware of the current recommendations for administration of Prevnar and
Pneumovax in adults. In discussing various urology topics, he described
screening for prostate cancer with a digital rectal exam and prostate-specific
antigen (PSA) test, both of which are no longer recommended. He recalled
only one of the medications used for management of prostatic hypertrophy
symptoms. When presented with a young male with flank pain and meaturia,
he correctly identified the possibility of a ureteral stone, but was unable to
describe the various crystalline forms of stones or their specific treatment, In
discussing care of the elderly, he indicated that he would use a tricyclic
antidepresessant (amitriptyline) or trazadone for insomnia, both of which are
relatively contraindicated in this age group. Similarly, he recommended use
of anticholinergic medications to manage urinary incontinence in the elderly,
but was unware of the significant risk of side effects. He described few
measures used to decrease the risk of falls in the elderly.

... In treating a hypothetical male patient with hypogonadism (symptoms of
fatigue, decreased libido and erectile dysfunction), but a normal testosterone
level, Dr. DiSanto recommended treatment with testosterone with added HCG
and occasionally Oxandrolone, which is not the current standard of care in
allopathic or functional medicine. ... Additionally, when asked about
hormonal replacement in women, he was not able to clearly describe the
diagnostic criteria for female menopause, and incorrectly stated that the
USPSTF guidelines currently recommend estrogen supplementation in the
post-menopausal period for osteoporosis, vaginal dryness, and climacteric
issues. He was not aware of the risk of endometrial/uterine cancer with
unopposed estrogen therapy, and would not use progesterone

supplementation because of its androgenic side effects, which is contrary to
current recommendations.

15. CPEP found that the licensee demonstrated “inadequate” clinical judgment and reasoning,

Stating in part

.he did not demonstrate the ability to gather information in a logical,
organized, and complete fashion; his overall approach to many of the
hypothetical clinical cases appeared to be somewhat superficial and focused
only on the most commonly known symptoms and findings. For example,
when presented with a hypothetical case of a 45-year old female with
increasing fatigue and a history of apparent viral pharyngitis one year prior,
he inquired about the metabolic profile and thyroid level (which were normal)
and immediately diagnosed the problem as chronic fatigue syndrome. He did
not investigate other causes such as occult infection, lifestyle issues, chronic
anxiety, depression, drug or alcohol abuse or possible toxins. All consultants
that reviewed his charts noted a lack of adequate information in the history,
physical examination and laboratory investigation of many patients.

Dr. DiSanto demonstrated some difficulty recognizing acuity of illness, and
suggested less-than-appropriate plans, often ignoring known clinical evidence
of best practices. For example, in the hypothetical case of a 60-year old male
with polydipsia, polyuria, weight loss, and a blood glucose of 300, he initially
recommended lifestyle changes and a diet, without investigating other
possible comorbidities. When pressed, he suggested that he might add
Lisinopril and metformin, without recognizing that most probably a more
aggressive anti-glycemic regimen would be necessary. He rarely proposed a
differential diagnosis for a patient’s complex symptoms, such as in a
hypothetical young male starting a job in a new building and complaining of
