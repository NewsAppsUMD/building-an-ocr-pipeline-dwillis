Disciplinary Panel B (“Panel B”) of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the
“Board”) hereby SUMMARILY SUSPENDS the license of HAILEY E. DEKLERK, R.C.P.
(the “Respondent”), License Number L06500, to practice respiratory care in the State of
Maryland.

Panel B takes such action pursuant to its authority under Md. Code Ann., State
Gov't ("State Gov't") § 10-226(c)(2) (2014 Repl. Vol. and 2017 Supp.) and Md. Code
Regs. (“COMAR’) 10.32.02.08B(7), concluding that the public health, safety or welfare
imperatively requires emergency action.

INVESTIGATIVE FINDINGS

Based on information received by, and made known to Panel B, and the
investigatory information obtained by, received by and made known to and available to
Panel B, including the instances described below, Panel B has reason to believe that the

following facts are true:'

‘ The statements regarding the Respondent's conduct are intended to provide the Respondent with notice
of the basis of the summary suspension. They are not intended as, and do not necessarily represent a
complete description of the evidence, either documentary or testimonial, to be offered against the
Respondent in connection with this matter.
1. The Respondent was originally licensed to practice respiratory care in
Maryland on September 16, 2015, under License Number LO6500. The Respondent's
latest license was given the expiration date of May 30, 2018.

2. At all times relevant hereto, the Respondent was employed as a respiratory
care practitioner at a health care facility (the “Facility’) that is located in the State of
Maryland. The Facility employed the Respondent from November 16, 2015, until
December 7, 2017.

3. On or about December 11, 2017, the Facility notified the Board through a
Mandatory 10-Day Report (the “Report”) that it terminated the Respondent’s employment
as a respiratory care practitioner, effective December 7, 2017, after she failed to return to
work after completing an employee assistance program.

4. After reviewing the above Report, the Board initiated an investigation of this
matter. By first class mail to the Respondent at her address of record, dated January 25,
2018, the Board notified her of its investigation and requested that she provide a written
response to the notifications that were set forth in the Report. The Board also requested
that the Respondent sign Authorization of Release of Information forms for any substance
abuse or mental health treatment that she may have received. On February 12, 2018,
the Board received its January 25, 2018, letter, returned as undeliverable, despite it being
sent to her address of record.

5. By email to the Respondent, dated February 8, 2018, the Board requested
that the Respondent contact the Board.

6. By first class mail to the Respondent, dated February 8, 2018, the Board

again notified her of its investigation and requested that she provide a written response
to the notifications that were set forth in the Report. The Board also requested that the
Respondent sign Authorization of Release of Information forms for any substance abuse
or mental health treatment that she may have received.

7. On February 13, 2018, Board staff contacted the Respondent by email and
telephone and requested that she provide her current address.

8. On February 14, 2018, the Respondent emailed the Board and provided an
updated mailing address.

9. By first class mail and email to the Respondent's updated address, dated
February 14, 2018, the Board again notified her of its investigation and requested that
she provide a written response to the notifications that were set forth in the Report. The
Board also requested that the Respondent sign Authorization of Release of Information
forms for any substance abuse or mental health treatment that she may have received.

10. By first class mail to the Respondent, dated March 9, 2018, the Board sent
the Respondent a subpoena ad testificandum to appear for a testimonial interview at the
Board’s offices on March 29, 2018. On March 29, 2018, the Respondent failed to appear
at the Board’s offices for her testimonial interview.

11. By UPS Next-Day Air and email to the Respondent dated April 4, 2018, the
Board directed the Respondent to appear for toxicology screening at a specific laboratory
on April 6, 2018. The letter recounted the Board’s earlier unsuccessful attempts to contact
her regarding this matter and informed her that her unreasonable failure to submit to the
screening could be construed as a failure to cooperate with a lawful investigation of the

Board.
12. By email dated April 5, 2018, the Respondent contacted the Board, after
which Board staff attempted to contact her by telephone, without success.

13. On April 6, 2018, the Respondent failed to appear for toxicology screening
as the Board directed her to do in its April 4, 2018, letter.

14. Based on the investigative facts, Panel B finds that the Respondent
presents a substantial likelihood of a risk of serious harm to the public health, safety and
welfare.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Based upon the foregoing Investigative Findings, Panel B of the Board concludes
that the public health, safety, or welfare imperatively requires emergency action, and
that pursuant to State Gov't § 10-226(c)(2) and COMAR 10.32.02.08B(7), the
Respondent's license is summarily suspended.
