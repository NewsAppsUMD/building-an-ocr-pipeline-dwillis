ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION

Disciplinary Panel A (“Panel A”) of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the
“Board”) hereby SUMMARILY SUSPENDS Kuchak K. Jalali, M.D.’s (the
“Respondent”) license to practice medicine in the State of Maryland, License Number
D42334.

Panel A takes such action pursuant to its authority under Md. Code Ann., State
Gov’t ("State Gov’t") § 10-226(c)(2) (2014 Repl. Vol. and 2018 Supp.), concluding that
the public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires emergency action. Panel A
bases its conclusion on the following investigative findings.

INVESTIGATIVE FINDINGS'

Panel A has obtained investigatory information that Respondent’s continued
practice of medicine poses a substantial likelihood or risk of serious harm to public health
safety and welfare as evidenced by:

1. His responses, behavior, and conduct during an interview by Board staff on
January 7, 2019;

' The statements regarding Respondent’s conduct are intended to provide Respondent with notice of the
basis of the suspension. They are not intended as, and do not necessarily represent a complete description
of the evidence, either documentary or testimonial, to be offered against Respondent regarding this
matter.
2. His responses, behavior, and conduct, four days later, on January 11, 2019,
when Board staff conducted a site visit at his medical office;

3. His initial consultation at the Maryland Professional Rehabilitation
Program (“MPRP”) on February 4, 2019, which revealed evidence of

professional, physical or mental incompetence; and

4. His failure to submit to an appropriate examination as directed by the
Board, pursuant Health Occ. § 14-402.

The Board opened this case based on a complaint about Respondent’s prescribing
of opioids for a patient who subsequently overdosed and required several days of
hospitalization. The initial focus of the investigation was on possible inappropriate
prescribing of opioids and other controlled dangerous substances (“CDS”). However,
after Board staff interviewed Respondent in January 2019, the focus of the investigation
became Respondent’s competence and potential danger to the public.

Based on the investigatory information obtained by Panel A as summarized
above, and the specific instances described below, Panel A has reason to believe that the
following facts are true and that there is a substantial likelihood of a risk of serious harm
to the public health, safety, or welfare by Respondent.

L Background of License

1. At all times relevant hereto, Respondent was, and is, licensed to practice
medicine in Maryland. Respondent was originally licensed to practice medicine in
Maryland on September 17, 1991. On or about September 16, 2018, Respondent last

renewed his license, which will expire on September 30, 2020.

1978, which expired in or about 2015. Respondent also holds inactive licenses to
practice medicine in New Jersey (granted 1970), Massachusetts (granted 1990), and
Connecticut (granted 1992).

3. Respondent graduated from medical school in 1959. He received post-
graduate training in anesthesiology, surgery, preventive medicine, occupational medicine,
and psychiatry. At present, Respondent’s self-designated specialty is pain management.

6. On August 22, 2012, Respondent was reprimanded, and he was placed on
probation for a minimum of two years with terms and conditions. The Board found that
Respondent failed to meet standards of quality medical care in regard to nine of thirteen
patients reviewed because of deficiencies in his pain management practice, including his
prescribing of opioids, and he failed to keep adequate medicals records because they were
illegible.

Board of Medicine and was placed on probation for two years, based on the action taken
by the Maryland Board. His Pennsylvania license expired while Respondent was on
probation.

Respondent having successfully complied with the terms and conditions. The Reprimand
remains in effect.

prescribing practices from a physician who is licensed to practice medicine in another

Respondent (“Patient 1’) had been admitted to a hospital in Maryland (“Hospital A’) on
July 10, 2018, for an opioid overdose and was on a ventilator for five days. The

Complainant reported that when he asked Patient 1’s friends where Patient 1 obtained
“his pills” they stated, “From Dr. Jalali. bring him an MRI and for $250 cash he will
write you a script for 90 oxys (oxycodone).”

print-out from the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (“PDMP”) of all CDS written
by Respondent from July 1, 2017 to August 8, 2018.

11. On September 18, 2018, pursuant to subpoena, Respondent submitted

has had low blood sugar incidents since his appointment with MPRP. The Family
Member questioned the necessity of the evaluation and terminated the conversation.
