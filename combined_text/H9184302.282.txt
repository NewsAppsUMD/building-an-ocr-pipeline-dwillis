ORDER FOR SUSPENSION OF LICENSE
TO PRACTICE MEDICINE

Disciplinary Panel A (“Panel A”) of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the
“Board”) hereby SUSPENDS the license of VIRGIL WAID MCMILLION, D.O. (the
“Respondent”), License Number H91843, to practice medicine in the State of Maryland.
Panel A takes such action pursuant to its authority under Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. §
14-3A-01 §§ 10(d), 24(c) and Interstate Medical Licensure Compact Rule 6.5g.

On June 9, 2021, the Respondent was licensed to practice medicine in Maryland,
under License Number H91843 through the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact
(““IMLC”). Health Occ. § 14-3A-01 § 5. The Respondent’s license is current through
September 30, 2023.

On February 18, 2022, the Board received a notice from the IMLC that the
Respondent’s Wyoming medical license was summarily suspended. On February 17,
2022, the Wyoming Board of Medicine issued an Order titled Order of Summary
Suspension of Virgil Waid McMillion, D.O., Wyoming Physician License No. 13661C,
NPI 1073520466, Pending a Contested Case Hearing. That Order summarily suspended

the Respondent’s license beginning on February 17, 2022.
Under the compact, Health Occ. § 14-3A-01 § 10(d), “if a license granted to a
physician by a member board is . . . suspended, then any license(s) issued to the physician
by any other member board(s) shall be suspended, automatically and immediately
without further action necessary by the other member board(s), for ninety (90) days on
entry of the order by the disciplining board, to permit the member board(s) to investigate
the basis for the action under the Medical Practice Act of that state.”

Under the compact, Health Occ. § 14-3A-01 § 24(c), “all rules . . . promulgated by
the Commission, are binding on the member states.” IMLC Rule 6.5g states that “[u]pon
receipt of notice from the Interstate Commission of an action taken by a non-state of
principal license, the other member Boards shall suspend the Compact physician for 90
calendar days on entry of the order of the disciplining Board to permit the member Board
to investigate under the Medical Practice Act of that state.” And, under IMLC Rule 6.5h,
“After an investigation has been completed, but within 90 calendar days of the
suspension, one of the following may occur: (1) a state of principal license may terminate
the suspension of the license; (2) a non-state of principal license may terminate the
suspension if the state of principal license has already terminated the suspension; (3) any
member Board may impose reciprocal discipline or pursue reciprocal discipline pursuant
to Rule 6.5(b) or (c); or (4) any member Board may continue the suspension until the
member Board that initially took the action has taken a final action.”

Based upon the foregoing, Panel A concludes that the Board is required to

automatically administratively suspend the Respondent’s license for a period of 90 days.
