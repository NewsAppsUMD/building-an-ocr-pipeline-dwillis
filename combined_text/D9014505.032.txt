ORDER FOR SUSPENSION OF LICENSE
TO PRACTICE MEDICINE

Disciplinary Panel A (“Panel A”) of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the
“Board”) hereby SUSPENDS the license of FARHAAD R. RIYAZ, MD (the
“Respondent”), License Number D90145, to practice medicine in the State of Maryland.
Panel A takes such action pursuant to its authority under Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. §
14-3A-01 §§ 10(d), 24(c) and Interstate Medical Licensure Compact Rule 6.5g.

On August 11, 2020, the Respondent was licensed to practice medicine in
Maryland, under License Number D90145 through the Interstate Medical Licensure
Compact (“IMLC”). Health Occ. § 14-3A-01 § 5. The Respondent’s license is current
through September 30, 2023.

On April 22, 2022, the Board received a notice from the IMLC that disciplinary
action had been taken by the Colorado Medical Board, the Arizona Medical Board and
the Alabama Medical Licensure Commission against the Respondent’s medical licenses.
On February 23, 2022, the Colorado Medical Board issued an Order titled Order of

Summary Suspension Pursuant to §24-4-104(4), CRS. The Respondent subsequently
entered into a Non-Disciplinary Interim Cessation of Practice Agreement, dated March
22, 2022.

By letter dated March 3, 2022, the Alabama Medical Licensure Commission
administratively suspended the Respondent’s license based on the suspension of his
Colorado medical license.

In lieu of summary suspension, the Respondent entered into an Interim Consent
Agreement for Practice Restriction with the Arizona Medical Board on March 11, 2022.

Under the compact, Health Occ. § 14-3A-01 § 10(d), “if a license granted to a
physician by a member board is . . . suspended, then any license(s) issued to the physician
by any other member board(s) shall be suspended, automatically and immediately
without further action necessary by the other member board(s), for ninety (90) days on
entry of the order by the disciplining board, to permit the member board(s) to investigate
the basis for the action under the Medical Practice Act of that state.”

Under the compact, Health Occ. § 14-3A-01 § 24(c), “all rules... promulgated by
the Commission, are binding on the member states.” IMLC Rule 6.5g states that “[u]pon
receipt of notice from the Interstate Commission of an action taken by a non-state of
principal license, the other member Boards shall suspend the Compact physician for 90
calendar days on entry of the order of the disciplining Board to permit the member Board
to investigate under the Medical Practice Act of that state.” And, under IMLC Rule 6.5h,
“After an investigation has been completed, but within 90 calendar days of the
suspension, one of the following may occur: (1) a state of principal license may terminate

the suspension of the license; (2) a non-state of principal license may terminate the
suspension if the state of principal license has already terminated the suspension; (3) any
member Board may impose reciprocal discipline or pursue reciprocal discipline pursuant
to Rule 6.5(b) or (c); or (4) any member Board may continue the suspension until the
member Board that initially took the action has taken a final action.”

Based upon the foregoing, Panel A concludes that the Board is required to
automatically administratively suspend the Respondent’s license for a period of 90 days.
