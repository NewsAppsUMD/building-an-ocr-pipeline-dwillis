BACKGROUND

1. At all times relevant, the Respondent was licensed to practice as a respiratory
care practitioner ("RCP”) in the State of Maryland. The Respondent was initially
licensed in Maryland on or about July 2, 2010, and her license is scheduled to expire on
or about May 30, 2018.

2. At all times relevant, the Respondent was employed by Hospital A? in Baltimore,
Maryland, as a Respiratory Therapist.

3. The Respondent was employed at Hospital A from July 12, 2010 through May 5,
2016, when Hospital A terminated her from employment for reasons set forth below.

4. On or about May 16, 2016, Hospital A filed a Mandated 10-Day Report (the
“Report”) with the Board notifying the Board the Respondent's employment had been
terminated based on her diversion of intravenous (“IV”) fentanyl, a Schedule Il
controlled dangerous substance (“CDS”), from a patient’s IV bag.

5. After receiving notification of the Report, the Board initiated an investigation into
the allegations.

6. The Board’s investigation into the complaint as set forth below included issuing
subpoenas to obtain the Respondent's personnel and fitness for duty files from Hospital
A, obtaining treatment records, and conducting interviews of Hospital A’s staff and the
Respondent.

7. On or about July 6, 2016, the Board notified the Respondent of its investigation

and requested a response.

? In order to maintain confidentiality, facility, patient and employee names will not be used in this
document, but will be provided to the Respondent on request.
8. On or about July 18, 2016, the Respondent submitted a written response to the
Board, acknowledging that at 5:30 a.m. on April 23, 2016, after making patient rounds,
while in the restroom at Hospital A, she injected fentanyl into her thigh, and “passed
out,” subsequently vomiting. A co-worker (“Employee A”) located the Respondent in

Report.

9. On or about July 29, 2015, while on duty, between 3:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m., the
Respondent lost consciousness at work after she overdosed on CDS including
oxycodone, morphine, fentanyl and Suboxone. She reportedly was being treated for
pain for a medical condition, and took more medication than had been prescribed. The
Respondent was evaluated by Hospital A’s emergency room and treated with Narcan, a
medication used to block the use of opioids. The Respondent was counseled not to
take narcotics while at work, and that she should find “alternate medications.”

place on or about April 23, 2016, when she was assigned to the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit.

12. At approximately 6:00 a.m. on April 23, 2016, two of the Respondent's co-
workers, Employees A and B, attempted to locate the Respondent, who was missing
from the unit. And subsequently, at 6:30 a.m., the Respondent was not present at shift
report.

13. At approximately 6:55 a.m., Employee A located the Respondent in a toilet stall
in the employee locker room. According to Employee A, the Respondent was “covered
in vomit and there was a syringe on the floor.” The Respondent's speech was slurred.
14. Employee A assisted the Respondent with cleaning and changing the
Respondent's scrub suit, and based on the Respondent's condition, Employee A drove
her to Employee A’s residence. During the ride, the Respondent “confessed” to taking a
bag of fentanyl from the unit.*

thigh.

16. At Employee A’s residence, Employee A searched the Respondent's bag, and
found additional syringes filled with fluid.

from the Employee Assistance Program (“EAP”) the next day. The Respondent did not
report to the EAP, and instead proceeded to work additional shifts.

18. The incident was initially reported to the Director of Respiratory Therapy at

Hospital A by Employee C on May 2, 2016.

3 Employee A subsequently reported the Respondent’s conduct to Employee C, who reported it to the Director of
Respiratory Care Services (the “Director”).

19. On or about May 2, 2016, the Respondent's manager sent her for a Fitness for
Duty Evaluation. The Director noted that the evaluation was based on the

name for Narcan), fentanyl and buprenorphine (generic name for Suboxone).

21. On or about May 3, 2016, the Director conducted an investigation, and
determined that “large volumes” of “drugs” had been missing from ICU units at Hospital
Aon six separate dates in April 2016 in which the Respondent had been on duty.

employment.
