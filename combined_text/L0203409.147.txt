Case No.: 2017-0349A
License No.: L02034

Dear Mr. Opoku and Mr. Gilbert:

On August 31, 2017, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
RESPIRATORY CARE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t II, § 10-
226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl. Vol. and 2016 Supp.). Mr. Opoku was given an opportunity to attend a
postdeprivation hearing before Disciplinary Panel A to show cause why that suspension should
not be continued on September 13, 2017. Mr. Opoku attended the hearing on that date. The State
was represented by Robert J. Gilbert, Deputy Counsel, Administrative Prosecutor. Both parties
presented oral arguments at the show cause hearing.

After considering these arguments at the hearing and the investigative file, Disciplinary
Panel A determined that it would continue the summary suspension imposed on August 31,
2017. Disciplinary Panel A thus will not lift the summary suspension order. The arguments
submitted, when considered in the light of the investigative findings in the file, persuade
Disciplinary Panel A there exists a substantial risk of serious harm to the public health, safety or
welfare in Mr. Opoku’s continued practice. Disciplinary Panel A, through its counsel, advised
Mr. Opoku of this decision orally on the hearing date.

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, Mr. Opoku has the right to request a full evidentiary hearing
before an Administrative Law Judge. This request will be granted if the Board receives a written
request for the hearing within TEN (10) days of the date of this letter. Any request for a hearing
should be sent to Christine A. Farrelly, Executive Director, at the Board’s address. If such a
hearing is requested, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set the hearing to
begin within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08 I, though that 30-day requirement

may be waived.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel A resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely yours,

j i «

Maryland State Board of Physicians
