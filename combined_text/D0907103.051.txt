Panel A takes such action pursuant to its authority under Md. Code Ann., State
Gov’t § 10-226(c) (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2020 Supp.) and COMAR 10.32.02.08B(7),
concluding that the public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires emergency action.

INVESTIGATIVE FINDINGS

Based on information received by, and made known to Panel A, and the
investigatory information obtained by, received by and made known to and available to
Panel A, including the instances described below, Panel A has reason to believe that the

following facts are true:!

' The statements regarding Panel A’s investigative findings are intended to provide the Respondent with
notice of the basis of the suspension. They are not intended as, and do not necessarily represent, a complete
description of the evidence, either documentary or testimonial, to be offered against the Respondent in
connection with this matter.
1. At all times relevant hereto, the Respondent was and is licensed to practice
medicine in the State of Maryland. The Respondent was originally licensed to practice
medicine in Maryland on January 18, 1971, under License Number D09071. The
Respondent’s license is current through September 30, 2022.

2. The Respondent is board-certified in neurological surgery.

3. At all times relevant, the Respondent is the owner of a medical practice where
he works part time and he holds hospital privileges at a hospital in Howard County (the
“Hospital”).

THE COMPLAINT

4. On or about April 1, 2020 the Board received a complaint from a former

patient (“Complainant”) about an incident that occurred in 2013.
BOARD INVESTIGATION

5. On receipt of the Complaint, the Board initiated an investigation into the
allegation. As part of its investigation, Board staff conducted interviews with the
Respondent, witnesses, and subpoenaed records including the Respondent’s personnel file
and the Complainant’s medical records.

6. The Board’s investigation revealed that on or about August 10, 2020, the
Hospital reprimanded the Respondent and required him to undergo an intake evaluation
and education by a physician health program (the “Program”).

7, On or about January 28, 2021, at the direction of the Program, the
Respondent underwent an independent evaluation to determine his present fitness to safely

practice medicine. On or about March 2, 2021, the Board received the report from the

2
independent evaluators. Based on his comprehensive testing and evaluation, the evaluator

concluded that the Respondent is “incapable of practicing medicine safely” as a result of

his condition.?
