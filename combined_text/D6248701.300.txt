Case No.: 2219-0202B
License No.: D62487

Dear Dr. Schnitzlein, Ms. McSherry, and Mr. Malizio:

On January 14, 2020, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann.,
State Gov’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2019 Supp.).

Pursuant to the Order, on January 29, 2020, Disciplinary Panel B held a postdeprivation
hearing to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. Dr. Schnitzlein, and his
counsel, M. Natalie McSherry, Esq. attended the hearing on that date. The State was represented
by W. Adam Malizio, Assistant Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor. Dr. Schnitzlein
and his counsel did not contest the summary suspension at the postdeprivation hearing.

After considering the investigative file, Disciplinary Panel B determined that it would
continue the summary suspension imposed on January 14, 2020. Disciplinary Panel B thus will
not lift the summary suspension order. Disciplinary Panel B finds that the public health, safety or
welfare imperatively requires the suspension of Dr. Schnitzlein’s license. See State Gov’t, § 10-

226(c)(2)(i). The order of summary suspension is thus reaffirmed and continues. See COMAR
10.32.02.08H(1).

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, Dr. Schnitzlein has the right to request a full evidentiary
hearing before an Administrative Law Judge at the Office of Administrative Hearings. To
receive the evidentiary hearing, Dr. Schnitzlein or his counsel must file the request for the
hearing within TEN (10) days of the date of this letter. The request for a hearing should be sent
to Christine Farrelly, Executive Director, at the Board’s address. If the hearing is timely
requested, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set the hearing to begin
within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08I, though that 30-day time period may be
waived.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel B resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely yours,

Signature On File
