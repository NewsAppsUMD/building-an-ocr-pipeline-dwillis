FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
INTRODUCTION

On April 4, 2016, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
(“Panel B”) charged Bryan S. Williams, M.D. with immoral and unprofessional conduct in the
practice of medicine, willfully making or filing a false report in the practice of medicine, and
willfully making a false representation when seeking or making application for licensure. See
Md. Code Ann., Health Occupations (“Health Occ.”) §§ 14-404(a)(3), (11), and (36). The
charges also alleged that Dr. Williams violated the Board’s sexual misconduct regulations,
COMAR 10.32.17.01-.03, by inappropriately touching three female patients when performing
physical examinations.

After the charges were issued, the Board received complaints from additional patients
who reported similar allegations regarding Dr. Williams’s conduct. On May 18, 2016, following
the receipt of the additional complaints, Panel B summarily suspended Dr. Williams’s license to
practice medicine. On May 25, 2016, Dr. Williams was provided with the opportunity to show
cause as to why the summary suspension should not be continued. Following the hearing, Panel
B concluded that Dr. Williams continued to present a substantial likelihood of a risk of serious
harm to the public health, safety, or welfare and voted to affirm the summary suspension. Dr.
Williams initially requested a full evidentiary hearing before an Administrative Law Judge

(“ALJ”) at the Office of Administrative Hearings (“OAH”), but withdrew the request for a
hearing prior to the scheduled hearing date. Accordingly, the summary suspension remains in
effect.

On May 27, 2016, Disciplinary Panel B issued amended charges, which added the
allegations of four additional patients to the original charges, pursuant to the same disciplinary
grounds. The amended charges were forwarded to OAH for an evidentiary hearing and a
proposed decision. A six-day hearing was held before an ALJ at OAH. On February 13, 2017,
the ALJ issued a proposed decision concluding that Dr. Williams was guilty of unprofessional
and immoral conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3);
willfully made or filed a false report in the practice of medicine, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-
404(a)(11); and willfully made a false representation when seeking or making application for
licensure or any other application related to the practice of medicine, in violation of Health Occ.
§ 14-404(a)(36). The ALJ proposed that the amended charges be upheld and recommended the
permanent revocation of Dr. Williams’s medical license.

On March 6, 2017, Dr. Williams filed exceptions to the ALJ’s proposed decision, and the
State filed a response to Dr. Williams’s exceptions. On May 10, 2017, both parties appeared
before Disciplinary Panel A (“Panel A” or “the Panel’) of the Board for an exceptions hearing.

FINDINGS OF FACT

At all times relevant to this proceeding, Dr. Williams was a licensed physician in the
State of Maryland, initially licensed on October 18, 2007. From November 2010 through
October 2014, Dr. Williams was employed as an interventional pain management specialist at

Facility A.! The charges in this case concerned Dr. Williams’s inappropriate touching of seven

was not being controlled with the current medication in the pump. Dr. Williams indicated that he
wished to conduct an examination and Patient 3 consented. Dr. Williams asked Patient 3 to lower
her pants and underwear to the point where her entire buttocks was exposed. Dr. Williams
pressed up and down Patient 3’s spine and then when he got to her hips, he moved around
towards the front of her body. When he got to the front of her body, he pressed on a soft spot and
Patient 3 winced in pain. Dr. Williams stated that it was pelvic pain and began examining in
between Patient 3’s legs.

According to Patient 3, Dr. Williams started pushing up in between her legs on both sides
and then placed two fingers inside her vagina and pushed on each side. Patient 3 said to Dr.
Williams, “I don’t like where you’re at.” Dr. Williams did not stop pressing in the vaginal area or
explain to Patient 3 what he was doing or why he needed to examine that area. Dr. Williams then
concluded the examination and left the room. After Patient 3 left the office, she told her husband
and her primary care provider what had occurred and researched online whether it was
appropriate for Dr. Williams to insert his fingers into her vagina as part of an examination for
back pain. At her next appointment, she brought her husband with her and addressed her
concerns with Dr. Williams. Dr. Williams said to Patient 3’s husband, “You have a very smart
wife” and then changed the subject to other issues concerning Patient 3’s care and treatment.

Dr. Williams does not challenge any of the ALJ’s factual findings with respect to Patient
3, but rather, argues that the investigation into Patient 3’s allegations was incomplete, which
deprived him of the opportunity to demonstrate inconsistencies in Patient 3’s testimony. Dr.
Williams argued that the Board should have interviewed the individuals that Patient 3

complained to about Dr. Williams’s conduct.

11
As discussed above, Dr. Williams had the opportunity to call witnesses at the hearing
before the ALJ to challenge the patient’s testimony, but he declined to do so. He had the
opportunity to subpoena witnesses that were not called or interviewed by the Board and explore
any evidence that he deemed was missing from the Board’s investigation in his own case in
chief. Dr. Williams had the opportunity for a full and fair hearing on the charges. The State
presented sufficient evidence to support the charges without any additional witnesses named by
Dr. Williams. The Panel finds that Dr. Williams committed a sexual violation as to Patient 3,
and, therefore, is guilty of immoral and unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in
violation of Health Occ. §14-404(a)(3). Dr. Williams’s exception is denied.

Patient 4

Dr. Williams takes exception to the ALJ’s finding that he committed a sexual violation
by giving Patient 4 a caudal spinal steroid injection in her gluteal cleft without medical necessity.
He contends that he performed an appropriate caudal epidural steroid injection on Patient 4 at the
sacral hiatus.

The patient testified that, on May 8, 2014, she believed she was at Dr. Williams’s office
to receive a lumbar epidural steroid injection. She signed a consent form, which included consent
for “Lumbar, sacral, caudal epidural steroid injection” and hip injection under ultrasound. Dr.
Williams then asked the patient to lay face-down and lower her pants. She lowered her pants to
midway on her buttocks, which she believed was appropriate based on the lumbar injections that
she received in the past. Dr. Williams asked her to lower her pants farther down, which she did,
and her entire buttocks were then exposed. Dr. Williams explained that he was doing the

procedure using ultrasound and that he would first numb the area. Patient 4 explained:
When he got ready to, you know, start the procedure, he spreaded my butt
cheeks. He was pushing with a finger, I don’t know which finger, but it was a lot

of poking down there.

And I said to him, “No doctor has ever done down this far before. I’ve had

these injections done before and no doctor has ever gone down this far,” and he

said to me that he’s trying to get it as close to the nerve as possible.

Patient 4 explained that the injection she received was different from the previous injections
because this injection was “in between my buttocks.”

Dr. Williams did not tell her that she was getting a different type of injection than she had
previously received or explain to her the reason for the different type of injection. The medical
record reflects that a caudal epidural steroid injection under ultrasound guidance was performed,
which is different from the lumbar epidural steroid injection that she had received in the past.
The patient testified on cross examination that she had never received a caudal injection before
and that she now recognizes that this injection is done lower than the lumbar injections which
she was used to receiving.

While Dr. Williams should have informed the patient that she would be getting a
different type of injection then she had received in the past and explained the reasons for doing
the caudal injection, in light of the apparent confusion about the type of injection being
performed, the Panel finds that there is insufficient evidence to substantiate a finding of sexual
misconduct as to Patient 4. Dr. Williams’s exceptions to the ALJ’s decision pertaining to Patient
4 are granted. The Panel does not adopt the ALJ’s discussion for Patient 4.

Patient 5

Dr. Williams began treating Patient 5’s back pain in 2013. On November 23, 2013, Dr.

Williams saw Patient 5 for a follow-up examination without anyone else present in the

examination room. Dr. Williams asked Patient 5 to lay face down on the examination table. The

patient’s pants were lowered to her thighs and her underwear was lowered just above the crack in

13
her buttocks. Dr. Williams asked about her pain and the previous procedures that she had
undergone and then started squeezing her thigh and worked his way up her leg until he got about
a tenth of an inch from her rectum and vagina. Patient 5 testified that the examination lasted
approximately 4 minutes, which she felt was a long time considering Dr. Williams was already
familiar with her history of pain. Patient 5 saw Dr. Williams on several occasions for injections
and procedures related to the treatment of her back pain, but at the appointment in question,
Patient 5 did not undergo a procedure. On the date in question, Patient 5 was certain that she was
alone in the room with Dr. Williams and that no other staff were present.

Patient 5 felt very uncomfortable during and after the examination, but she dismissed her
feelings at the time and continued seeing Dr. Williams because she continued to have pain. In
April of 2016, Patient 5’s daughter told Patient 5 that she saw a news story concerning sexual
assault allegations against Dr. Williams, which prompted Patient 5 to file a complaint with the
Board.

Dr. Williams argued that Patient 5 was not credible because she changed the date of the
alleged incident, which she stated was March 27, 2014, in the complaint to November 27, 2013,
at the OAH hearing and changed the location of the examination from Largo to Kensington.
Patient 5 acknowledged in her testimony that she gave the wrong date in her complaint and in
her interview with the Board investigator. She explained that, upon further review of her medical
records, the date could not have been March 27, 2014, because there were nurses present at that
appointment and the appointment that the inappropriate touching occurred happened when there
was no one else besides Patient 5 and Dr. Williams in the room.

The ALJ considered the discrepancies in Patient 5’s testimony pointed out by Dr.

Williams and, nevertheless, found Patient 5 credible. The ALJ placed more weight on the details

14
that Patient 5 gave regarding the examination rather than on the accuracy of the dates and found
that the changes in Patient 5’s testimony did not undermine her credibility. On the other hand,
the ALJ did not find Dr. Williams to be credible. The Panel adopts the ALJ’s credibility
determinations with respect to Patient 5 and Dr. Williams.

Patient 5 was steadfast in her testimony about what occurred at her November 23, 2013,
office visit with Dr. Williams. She acknowledged the discrepancies in the dates she gave, yet
remained unwavering in her testimony as to what occurred at the appointment. The details of the
inappropriate touching remain consistent, and the ALJ who had the opportunity to make
demeanor based credibility findings found Patient 5 credible. The Panel agrees with the ALJ’s
finding that Dr. Williams committed a sexual violation as to Patient 5 and, as a result, Dr.
Williams is guilty of immoral and unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in
violation of Health Occ. §14-404(a)(3). Dr. Williams’s exception as to Patient 5 is denied.
Patient 6

Patient 6 began seeing Dr. Williams for lower back pain in May of 2011. She was
referred to Dr. Williams by another doctor because Dr. Williams performed epidural injections
under sedation. On one occasion, during a low back examination, Dr. Williams asked Patient 6 to
lower her jeans and he pressed on her spine until he got to her buttocks and then when he got
down to her buttocks he took her buttocks in his hands and groped her buttocks. Patient 6 was
clear that the “fatty part of [her] butt” was in Dr. Williams’s hands. Patient 6 was shown a You
Tube video of a lumbar spinal examination and she testified, “Dr. Williams did all of that, but
then his hands came down further. And then as he was going down my spine, my buttocks was
like in his hands, and that doctor [in the video] did not do that to the young lady.” The Panel

finds that Dr. Williams exceeded the boundaries of a medically indicated appropriate lower back

15
examination and abused the trust of the patient in engaging in inappropriate sexual touching of
her buttocks.

Patient 6 returned to see Dr. Williams for subsequent appointments because he was the
only doctor she knew who would perform spinal injections under sedation. During one
appointment when Patient 6 was at the surgical center to get a spinal injection, Dr. Williams
conducted an examination of her and his thumb brushed across her clitoris. Patient 6 was
wearing a gown and was fully unclothed except for her underwear. On both occasions there was
no chaperone present during the examination and Dr. Williams did not wear gloves. Patient 6 did
not complain to anyone about Dr. Williams’s conduct at the time because she trusted him and
thought that maybe she misinterpreted his conduct. Patient 6 testified that she was uncomfortable
with Dr. Williams’s conduct, yet still believed he was a good doctor and was complimentary of
his care. She did not want to believe that Dr. Williams would touch her inappropriately, but
when she was informed of the news broadcast concerning allegations against Dr. Williams she
reassessed whether her concerns were unfounded and she filed a complaint with the Board
because she did not want anyone else to go through what she went through.

Dr. Williams argues that Patient 6 is not credible because she could not remember
specific dates when the conduct occurred and she changed her testimony regarding whether Dr.
Williams was standing or sitting on a stool during the examination where he brushed her clitoris.
At the OAH hearing Patient 6 admitted that she was unsure about whether Dr. Williams was
standing or sitting when he examined her, but she was unyielding in her testimony that the
touching occurred. She explained, “I know what he did. I know his finger went across my
clitoris. I’m sorry if I did not get everything correct when I went there. I know that’s what he did

to me.”
The ALJ considered the discrepancies in Patient 6’s testimony pointed out by Dr.
Williams and, nevertheless, found Patient 6 credible despite the lack of precision in her
testimony. The ALJ placed more weight on the details Patient 6 gave regarding Dr. Williams’s
conduct and did not find Dr. Williams credible. The Panel adopts the ALJ’s credibility
determinations with respect to Patient 6 and Dr. Williams. The Panel finds that Dr. Williams
committed a sexual violation as to Patient 6 and, therefore, is guilty of immoral and
unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation of Health Occ. §14-404(a)(3).
Dr. Williams’s exception as to Patient 6 is denied.

Patient 7

As discussed above, Patient 7 did not testify at the OAH hearing. The State submitted the
transcript of Patient 7’s interview with the Board investigator, which was admitted into evidence.
Patient 7 could not recall the date of the inappropriate exam, but estimated that it occurred during
the summer of 2014. Patient 7’s medical records, however, reflect that the date of the
examination was May 23, 2013. On May 30, 2013, Patient 7 called the office and spoke with a
physician assistant asking for an explanation of the exam Dr. Williams performed on her.

Dr. Williams argues that the ALJ had no ability to assess demeanor of Patient 7 because
Patient 7 did not testify at the hearing and erroneously relied on the transcript of Patient 7’s
Board interview while ignoring the uncontroverted testimony of several witnesses who described
Patient 7 as dishonest. Dr. Williams also points out several inconsistencies in Patient 7’s
interview. For example, Dr. Williams notes that Patient 7 stated in her email through the patient
portal that Dr. Williams was wearing gloves during the examination, but in the complaint and in
her Board interview that Dr. Williams was not wearing gloves. Patient 7 also stated that she had

seen Dr. Williams for several years before the date of the alleged incident, but her medical
records indicate that May 23, 2013 was the first visit that Patient 7 saw Dr. Williams. Dr.
Williams also points out that the Largo office location was not open as of the date when the
examination was alleged to have taken place.

Patient 7’s inconsistent statements were not able to be reconciled at the OAH hearing.
Further, the ALJ was not able to make any demeanor based credibility findings with respect to
Patient 7 because Patient 7 did not testify. While the transcript of her interview was properly
admitted, after considering the significant inconsistencies in Patient 7’s story, the lack of
testimony to harmonize the inconsistencies, the character witnesses who described her as
dishonest and drug-seeking, and the inability for the ALJ to make any demeanor based
credibility findings with respect to Patient 7, the Panel finds that there is insufficient evidence to
support a violation as to Patient 7. Dr. Williams’s exception with respect to Patient 7 is granted.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The Panel concludes that Dr. Williams is guilty of immoral and unprofessional conduct in
the practice of medicine, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3), due to his violations of the
Board’s sexual misconduct regulations, COMAR 10.32.17, for Patients 2, 3, 5, and 6, willfully
making or filing a false report in the practice of medicine, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-
404(a)(11), and willfully making a false representation when seeking or making application for
licensure or any other application related to the practice of medicine, in violation of Health Occ.
§ 14-404(a)(36). The Panel does not find a violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3) with respect
to Patients 1, 4, and 7.

SANCTION

Dr. Williams takes exception to the ALJ’s proposed sanction of a permanent revocation

and argues that a period of suspension followed by a period of probation would be a more

equitable sanction. The Panel found that Dr. Williams committed a sexual violation against four

18
patients. He abused his professional status and destroyed the trust his patients placed in him. The
Panel determines that revocation is an appropriate sanction in this case.
ORDER

On an affirmative vote of a majority of a quorum of Disciplinary Panel A, it is hereby

ORDERED that Dr. Williams’s license to practice medicine in Maryland (License
Number D66774) is REVOKED, and it is further

ORDERED that the May 18, 2017 order imposing a summary suspension is terminated
as moot; and it is further

ORDERED that this is a public document pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Gen. Prov. § 4—

Findings of Fact were proven by the preponderance of the evidence.

EXCEPTIONS

Dr. Williams filed five exceptions to the ALJ’s proposed decision and, additionally,
challenged the ALJ’s factual and credibility findings related to the seven patients who made
allegations against Dr. Williams. Each of Dr. Williams’s exceptions will be discussed in turn.

IL Facility A Subpoena and Investigation (Exceptions 1 and 2)

On August 18, 2016, the ALJ conducted a scheduling conference at OAH and indicated
to the parties that Dr. Williams could ask OAH to issue subpoenas to Facility A to produce its
investigation notes pertaining to the in-house investigation conducted based on Patient 1’s
complaint. The ALJ stated, “i]t is up to [Facility A] either to comply with or move to quash the
subpoena.” On September 19, 2016, the ALJ held a prehearing conference to address, in part,
any dispute that might arise from Dr. Williams’s subpoena for Facility A’s investigative notes.

On September 26, 2016, OAH issued seven subpoenas requested by Dr. Williams,
including one to Facility A. The subpoena issued to Facility A required a Facility A employee to
appear at the hearing scheduled for November 14, 2016, and produce “[a]ny/all notes made by

“ Dr. Williams does not take exception to the ALJ’s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law that he
willfully filed a false report or record in the practice of medicine, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(11), and
willfully made a false representation when making application for licensure, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-

‘PROPOSED DISPOSITION °
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
On April 4, 2016, a disciplinary panel of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (Board)
issued charges against Bryan S. Williams, M.D. (Respondent) for violating various provisions of
the Maryland Medical Practice Act (Act), the law governing the practice of medicine in this
State. Md. Code Ann., Health Occ, §§ 14-101 through 14-507, and 14-601 through 14-607 (2014
& Supp. 2016). The Board issued amended charges on May 27, 2016 (Amended Charges). The
Amended Charges contain two categories of charges by the Board against the Respondent. The
Board based its first category of charges on its investigatory findings that the Respondent had
inappropriately touched seven female patients in such a way that it constituted sexual

misconduct, subjecting him to sanction under sections 14-404(a)(3)(i) and (ii) of the Act and

Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) 10.32.17. It based its second category of charges on
its investigatory findings that the Respondent willfully made or filed false reports in the practice
of medicine and willfully made a false representation when seeking or making an application for
licensure, subjecting him to sanction under sections 14-404(a)(11) and (36) of the Act. The
disciplinary panel to which the complaint was assigned forwarded the Amended Charges to the
Office of the Attorney General for prosecution, and another disciplinary panel delegated the
matter to the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) for issuance of a Proposed Decision (i.e.,
Proposed Findings of Fact, Proposed Conclusions of Law and a Proposed Disposition). COMAR
10.32.02.03E(8); COMAR 10.32.02. 04B(1).)

Theld a hearing on November 14-18, 201 6 and November 21, 2016, at the OAH in Hunt
Valley, Maryland. Health Occ. § 14-405(a) (2014); COMAR 10.32.02.04. Assistant Attomey
General and Administrative Prosecutor Victoria H. Pepper represented the State of Maryland
(State). Catherine W. Steiner and M. Natalie McSherry, Attorneys-at-Law, represented the
Respondent, who was present.

Procedure in this case is governed by the contested case provisions of the Administrative
- Procedure Act, the Rules for Hearings Before the Board of Physicians, and the Rules of
Procedure of the OAH. Mad. Code Ann., State Gov’t §§ 10-201 through 10-226 (2014 & Supp.
2016); COMAR 10.32.02; COMAR 28.02.01.

ISSUES

1. Is the Respondent subject to sanction under section 14-404(a)(3)(i) and (ii) of the

Act for being guilty of immoral and unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, based on .

acts of sexual misconduct that he committed with respect to seven female patients?

1 On May 18, 2016, the Board summarily suspended the Respondent from the practice of medicine. (State’s Exhibit
No. 1.) It continued the Respondent’s summary suspension by an order it issued on May 25, 2016, after conducting a
show cause hearing on that date. (State’s Exhibit Nos, 2 and 3.) That summary suspension remains in effect.

2
2. Is the Respondent subject to sanction under section 14-404(a)(1 1) and (36) of the
Act for willfully making or filing false reports in the practice of medicine and/or willfully .
making a false representation when seeking or making an application for licensure?
3. If the Respondent is subject to sanction, what sanction is appropriate?
SUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE
The State pre-marked fifty-one exhibits, which it placed in binders in compliance with
my September 23, 2016 Prehearing Order. I admitted all of those exhibits except State Exhibit
Nos. 6, 23 and 40, which the State did not offer into evidence. The Respondent pre-marked thirty
exhibits and offered two additional exhibits (Nos. 31 and 32) during the hearing. The Respondent
also complied with my September 23, 2016 Prehearing Order by placing his exhibits in binders. I
did not admit Respondent Exhibit Nos. 15, 19, 28, 29, 30 and 32, because I sustained objections
to those exhibits raised by the State? (Ihave attached a complete Exhibit List as an Appendix to
this decision.)

PROPOSED FINDINGS OF FACT
Having considered all of the evidence presented, I find the following facts by a
preponderance of the evidence:
1. At all times relevant to this proceeding, the Respondent was a licensed physician
in the State of Maryland. he Respondent was initially licensed to practice n medicine in Maryland

on October 18, 2007, (stip. Parties,*)

“The parties agreed to several stipulations during the September 23, 2016 prehearing conference, which I have
incorporated into this decision,

4
2. The Respondent’s Maryland medical license is scheduled to expire on September
30, 2017. (Stip. Parties.)

3. The Respondent held active medical licenses in the District of Columbia and
Virginia until those licenses were suspended based on the Maryland Board’s summary
suspension. The Respondent also holds inactive medical licenses in California, Illinois and
Michigan. (Stip. Parties.)

4. The Respondent is board-certified in anesthesiology and the sub-specialty of pain
management. (Stip. Parties.)

5. From November 2010 through October 2014, the Respondent was employed as an

interventional pain management specialist 2 offices in Maryland. (Stip.
wt me a
Parties.)

6. On September 2, 2010, before beginning -his employment wit
the Respondent signed an Employment Agreement. The térms of that agreement allowed either
the Respondent i: terminate the Respondent’s employment relationship with

fF without giving’any reason for doing so. To exercise this voluntary separation

clause, the terminating party had to give the other party to the agreement ninety days’ prior
written notice. The Employment Agreement also stipulated that | terminate
the Respondent’s employment for cause immediately upon written notice to the Respondent.
(State’s Ex. 7 at 0040.)

7. Among the “for cause” bases for termination delineated in the Respondent’s
Employment Agreement wit TT: “Failure to comply wit
standards and policies, including but not limited to quality assurance, EEO, credentialing,
harassment, utilization management or confidentiality policies as in effect at this time or as may

be modified or adopted in the future.” (State’s Ex. 7 at 0041.)
 

8. At all times relevent TT ecroyea a chaperone policy applicable to

all of its physicians. That chaperone policy allowed all ‘patients (as well as parents and guardians)
to request a non-family member chaperone to be present during an examination or procedure,
including, but not limited to: (1) any pelvic examination and (2) any genital, breast and/or anal

Findings with Respect to Patient 1

9. - Patient 1 is fifty-eight-year-old woman.’ The Respondent treated Patient 1 from .
November 21, 2012 through January 24, 2014 for complaints of lower back pain that is most
prominent in her left buttock, hip and groin. (Test. Patient 1, T. at 198 and 200; State’s Ex. 8 at
6, 10; State’s Ex. 41 at 8-12.)

10. The lower back pain that Patient 1 was experiencing stemmed from an on-the, ob
accident that Patient 1 had in 2009. (Test. Patient 1, T. at 193.) 7

11. Patient 1, as a member of, lm a health maintenance organization (HMO),
generally must seek medical treatment TE. .:::-s if Bien: does not
have a health care practitioner who can treat his or her particular condition, he or she can seek a
referral to a physician outside of inf sem (Test. Patient 1, T. at 195.)

12. Before becoming the Respondent’s patient, Patient 1 had also sought relief from
her lower back pain by getting transforaminal epidural steroid injections (TFESI) from a pain
management physician at a a medical provider outside ine
system. After receiving at least six of these injections, Patient 1 was reluctant to have more of

them becausé of their painfulness. (Test. Patient 1, T. at 194-95; State’s Ex. 8 at 4.)

> The age given for all patients is their age as of the date that they testified at hearing.

13. To eliminate the need for TFESIs, Patient 1 underwent a surgical fusion of her
sacroiliac joint. That surgical fusion did not significantly reduce Patient 1’s lower back pain.
(Test. Patient 1, T. at 195; State’s Ex. 8 at 6; State’s Ex. 41 at 8.)

14. . In November 2012, the Patient sought a referral from her primary care physician
to A... management specialist, because of the poor experience she had when she
received TFESI procedures from her out-of-system pain management specialist. (Test. Patient, T.

- at 196.)

15. Patient 1 leamed through her primary care physician at) that the
Respondent might be helpful in alleviating her lower back pain, because he did not oppose
sedating patients while performing the TFESI procedure. Because the Respondent employed a
sedation technique called “twilight,” Patient 1 made an appointment to seek pain relief treatment
from the Respondent. (Test. Patient, T. at 196-97; State Ex. 8 at 4.)

16. - On November 21, 2012, Patient 1 visited the Respondent ‘ii

a Maryland Medical Office Building. There, he performed a physical examination of
Patient 1. No chaperone was present in the examination room while the Respondent examined
her. (Test Patient 1, T. at 198-99; State’s Ex. 41 at 11.)

17. When the Respondent physically examined Patient 1 on November 21, 2012, he
started by manipulating Patient 1’s legs while Patient 1 sat on an examination table. After
completing the leg manipulation, the Respondent had Patient 1 stand up and pull up her shirt, so
he could feel around her waist and hips. He then had her pull down her pants and underwear past
her buttocks. The Respondent then took his bare, ungloved hands and examined Patient 1’s lower

waist and buttocks. Starting at Patient 1’s hips, the Respondent went up and down Patient l’s
buttocks until, with both hands, he spread open Patient 1’s buttocks’ cheeks. To spread open
Patient 1’s buttocks cheeks, the Respondent grasped inside of Patient 1’s gluteal cleft (buttocks’
crack) with his fingers. Even though he separated Patient 1’s buttocks’ cheeks in this manner, he
did not digitally penetrate Patient 1’s anus. (Test. Patient 1, T. at 196-97, 200-01, 230, 245;
State’s Ex. 8 at 5, 13 and 15.) After he had examined Patient 1, the Respondent told Patient 1
that a nurse would call her to schedule a procedure (that is, a TFESI and/or lumbar facet joint
(LFJ) injection) to alleviate her lower back pain. (Test. Patient 1, T. at 198; State Ex. 41 at 12.)

18. Patient 1 considered the Respondent’s examination of her buttocks cheeks in the
manner that the Respondent examined them unnecessary to diagnose and treat her lower back
pain. Immediately after having her November 21, 2012 appointment with the Respondent, she
believed that the Respondent might have touched her inappropriately. Even so, she made no
complaints about the Respondent to anyone at that time. (Test. Patient 1, T. at 198.)

19, On December 14, 2012, the Respondent administered a TFESI and an LFJ
injection to Patient 1’s lower back in the Ambulatory Surgical Center (ASC) at

a: without incident, (State’s Ex. 41 at 16-38.)

20. On January 26, 2013, the Patient had a follow-up appointment with the
Respondent i She told the Respondent that the TFESI] and LFJ injection resolved _
many of her pain complaints in her lower back and buttocks, but she was now having pain in her
anterior hip area. (State’s Ex. 41 at 40.)

21. ‘On the afternoon of June 14, 2013, Patient 1 came to the ASC at

ae}: for another series of injections. (Test. Patient 1, T. at 203;

State’s Ex. 41 at 44, 48-69, 176-78.)
22. OnJune 14, 2013, in preparation for having a TFESI and an Ly injection to her
lower back region, the Respondent had Patient 1 disrobe completely and dress in a hospital
gown. (Test. Patient 1, T. at 203; State’s Ex. 8 at 17-18.) .

23. Before he administered the two injections to Patient 1 on June 14, 2013, the
Respondent examined her in a cubicle near the operating room at the ASC. The cubicle was
open, with patient privacy protected only by two moveable blue curtains that hung from a ceiling
track. That track allowed the curtains to be rolled into place in such a way that they met each
other and surrounded the cubicle. (Test. Patient 1 at 203.)

24, Only Patient 1 and the Respondent were present in the cubicle at _ |
ASC on June 14, 2013, when the Respondent examined Patient 1. (Test. Patient 1, T. at 204.)

25. On the afternoon of June 14, 2013, the Respondent closed the cubicle’s curtains
and examined Patient 1 by having her stand while he sat on a stool. The Respondent was facing
Patient 1’s back. He moved his hands from the bottom of Patient 1’s legs upward to her thighs.
He then moved up to Patient 1’s buttocks region, where placed his hands to the front of Patient
1’s body toward her vagina, coming close to the vaginal opening.” (State’s Ex. 8 at 18.)

26. | When the Respondent approached Patient 1’s vagina with his hands, Patient 1
exclaimed, “Man, what are you doing?” The Respondent reacted to Patient 1’s exclamation by

saying, “It’s all right. Don’t worry. It’s all right.”* (State’s Ex. 8 at 18.)

 

5 The ASC Surgery Consent Form that Patient 1 signed on June 14, 2013 identifies the procedure as a “lumbar
epidural steroid injection facet joint injection (left),” in other words, an LFJ injection, (State’s Ex. 4] at 176.) TFESI
is mentioned on Patient 1’s Anesthetic Record for June 14, 2013. (State’s Ex. 41 at 178.)

7 When she testified, Patient 1 melded her recollection of the June 2013 and January 2014 incidents. Although I find
what she related as a whole credible, I consider what she said to Board Investigator Noppinger on July 8, 2015 more
accurate than when she testified on November 14, 2016, because her Board interview occurred closer in time to
when the incidents happened. (See T. at 205.)

* Patient 1’s recollection of what the Respondent said varied slightly between what she testified to and what she told
Ms. Noppinger on July 8, 2015, At the hearing, Patient 1 stated that when the Respondent's hands came close to her
vagina, she exclaimed, “What are you doing,” and quoted the Respondent's reply as, “Don’t worry. It will be all
right.” On July 8, 2015, Patient 1 told Ms. Noppinger that she exclaimed, “Man, what are you doing?” and quoted
the Respondent’s reply as, “It’s all right. Don’t worry. It’s all right.” The two versions are very similar, but ] am
accepting the July 8, 2015 version, again, because it was closer in time to the date of the incident.

[Patient 1], [Physician A], [Physician B], [Employee A] or Dr. Bryan Williams regarding the
complaint made by [Patient 1] and investigated by [Facility A].” On November 4, 2016, Facility
A filed a motion to quash the subpoena. On November 9, 2016, the ALJ issued a ruling on
Facility A’s motion to quash, stating that he considered the matter closed based on the untimely
filing of Facility A’s motion to quash and, therefore, did not rule on Facility A’s motion “one

way or another.”*

The ALJ acknowledged at the hearing that the subpoenas were not quashed,
but that he did “not consider the subpoena outstanding at this pointf[.]”

Dr. Williams argues that the ALJ erred by failing to enforce the subpoena that was
issued to Facility A for the notes associated with the internal investigation Facility A conducted
regarding the allegations made by Patient 1. Dr. Williams also argues that the ALJ erred by
refusing to allow him to question witnesses from Facility A regarding the investigation. The
State responded that the investigation conducted by Facility A was an independent investigation,
which was not part of the Board’s investigation and, therefore, not relevant to the proceedings in
the case.

The subpoena in question was issued by OAH on September 26, 2016. There is nothing
in the record to suggest that the subpoena was improperly served. Facility A filed a motion to
quash the subpoena on November 4, 2016, citing attorney-client and work product doctrine
privileges. The ALJ did not rule on the motion one way or another, but considered the matter
closed based on Facility A’s untimely filed motion to quash based on the deadline imposed by
the ALJ. Because, however, the subpoena was not quashed, there remained an active subpoena
that the ALJ failed to enforce. According to Dr. Williams, the subpoena, if enforced, could have

provided evidence to disprove Patient 1’s allegations. The Panel agrees with Dr. Williams that

° Following the prehearing conference, the ALJ issued an Order stating, in part: “If, however, no action occurs with
regard to a subpoena request for [Facility A]’s patient interview notes by October 31, 2016, I shall consider the
matter closed.”
a7 . Patient 1 had no further discussion with the Respondent about the way he
examined her, because minutes later, an anesthesiologist administered an intravenous anesthetic
to Patient 1, sedating her, so she could tolerate the TFESI and LFJ procedures. (State’s Ex. 8 at
18.)

28. Patient | had other appointments with the Respondent between June 14, 2013 and
January 24, 2014, including appointments on July 26,.2013 and September 27, 2013, when the
Respondent administered injections to Patient 1’s lower back. Nothing noteworthy occurred
during those appointments. (Test. Patient 1, T. at 206; State’s Ex. 41 at 74-139, 170-72.)

29. Because of her concern about the way the Respondent had examined her on June
14, 2013, Patient 1 thereafter invited family members to serve as chaperones while the
Respondent examined her or performed procedures. (Test. Patient 1, T. at 208.)

30. On January 4, 2014, Patient | appeared at the ASC i. receive a
steroid injection/cooled radiofrequency ablation of lateral branch.? She invited her boyfriend,
Person 1, who was also her driver, to stay with her while the Respondent examined her. Patient 1
had previously disclosed her concerns about the Respondent’s examination techniques to Person
1. (Test. Patient 1, T. at 208; Test. Resp. at 1189-90; State’s Ex. 8 at 20-21; State’s Ex. 41 at
166-68.) a

31. On January 24, 2014, the Respondent had Patient 1 disrobe and put on a hospital
gown to facilitate the procedure. (Test. Patient 1, T. at 209; State’s Ex. 8 at 21-22.)

32. On January 24, 2014, the Respondent examined Patient 1 in a cubicle similar to
the one where he examined her on June 14, 2013. There was a bed and a chair inside the cubicle.
Just as on June 14, 2013, two movable curtains surrounded the cubicle. (Test. Patient 1, T. at
208.)

> Patient 1 misidentified the location of where the Respondent gave her her injections. Patient 1’s medical records
- reflect that on January 24, 2014, the injection procedures took place at the ASC in? tient 1 testified
that she thought she was i on that date. (Test. Patient 1, T. at 208.)

10
33. While the Respondent examined Patient 1 on January 24, 2014, Person 1 was
seated in a chair to the left of the bed on the opposite side of the cubicle from where the
Respondent was examining Patient 1. The Respondent closed the curtains. Person 1 was outside
the curtains. (Test. Patient 1, T. at 209.)

34. On January 24, 2014, the Respondent began his examination of Patient 1 by
having her stand with her arms spread out in front of her. With gloves on his hands, he sat on a
movable stool and started palpating at the base of Patient 1’s legs and continued to move his
- hands up her body until they reached underneath her hospital gown. He kept moving up until his

hands touched Patient 1’s vagina. Once there, the Respondent put his fingers inside Patient 1’s
vagina, and while doing so, his knuckles touched Patient 1’s clitoris. (rest Patient 1, T. at 209—
10, 212.) .

35. When Patient 1 felt the Respondent’s fingers inside her vagina, she became
annoyed. She asked the Respondent “Why are you doing this? You already determined there’s
nothing there triggering any pain. So, why you keep doing this?” The Respondent did not
respond. He ignored her and continued to feel around Patient 1’s vagina. (Test. Patient 1, T. at
209-11; Test. Person 1, T. at 288; State’s Ex. 8 at 22.)

36. After completing his examination of Patient 1, the Respondent took off his gloves,
sniffed them, rolled them up, and threw them in the trash. The Respondent sat on the stool for a
little while, then exited to the hallway, throwing his arms in the air as he walked away from the
examination cubicle. (Test. Person 1, T. at 289; State’s Ex. 9 at 13.)

37. After the Respondent examined Patient 1, he took Patient 1 to the ASC and
administered the steroid injection/cooled radiofrequency ablation of lateral branch to her in her

lower back under sedation. (State’s Ex. 41 at 140-68.)
 

: 38. . Not long after January 24, 2014, Patient 1 had an appointment with her primary
care physician, Dr. i: also was employed a During that

* visit, Patient 1 told Dr. a about how she believed the Respondent touched her
inappropriately when he examined her on January 24, 2014, immediately before she received her
injection. (Test. Patient 1, T. at 213, 246.)

genitals might become involved. The Respondent indicated to Dr. | he understood
that he had to use chaperones in the future, and noted he had, “learned a valuable lesson” from
the incident involving Patient 1. (Test. | T. at 547-48 and res T. at
633-34; State’s Ex. 19 at 7-8.) ,

43. On April 22, 2014, the Respondent attended an online Continuing Medical
Education (CME) seminar presentation called, “Understanding Boundary Violations and
Chaperone Use-Best Practices.” He attended this seminar at the direction of Dr. i Dr.

i: directed the Respondent to attend this seminar as a condition of returning to his
medical practice in February 2014. (Test. Resp., T. at 1243-47; State’s Ex. 32; Resp. Ex. 21.)
Findings with Respect to Patient 2 :

44, Patient 2 is a forty-two-year-old woman who was a member of| ma The
Respondent treated Patient 2 in TT ia Office Building on August 18;
2014 for spine-related pain. Patient 2 visited the Respondent based on a recommendation from
her primary care physician, > ic est. Patient 2, T. at 326-27; State’s Ex. 10 at 3;
State’s Ex. 43 at 00041-00045.)

45, Although Patient 2 only visited the Respondent once, she sent e-mails to him or
his staff until October 3, 2014. (Test. Patient 2, T. at 342; State’s Ex. 42 at 00031.)

46. The Respondent had Patient 2 obtain x-rays of her back before seeing her for an
examination.’! (Test. Patient 2, T. at 341.)

47. The Respondent examined Patient 2 in a small examination room. That room had

an examination table that was covered with paper, a sink, and a desk with a computer on it to

 

‘| When she testified at the hearing, Patient 2 did not mention anyone taking x-rays before she went into the
examination room with the Respondent, It is only logical, however, that she had her x-rays taken before seeing him,
because August 18, 2014 was the only time that the Respondent examined Patient 2, She mentioned the x-rays as an
afterthought in response to the Administrative Prosecutor’ questions concerning e-mails that she sent to the
Respondent. (T. at 341-42.)

13
allow the examining physician to make electronic entries in patients’ medical récords. A rolling
stool was also present for the physician's use during examinations. A door could be closed to
ensure patient privacy during examinations. (Test. Patient 2, T. at 328-29; State’s Ex. 10 at 4.) _

48. After a nurse escorted Patient 2 to the examination room, the Respondent entered
the room, closed the door and inquired about what he could do for Patient 2. (Test. Patient 2, T.
at 328; State’s Ex. 10 at 4.)

49. At the time of the examination, Patient 2 was wearing blue jeans and a white shirt.
(Test. Patient 2, T. at 331; State’s Ex. 10 at 13.)

50. No chaperone was present in the examination room when the Respondent
examined Patierit 2 on August 18, 2014. (Test. Patient 2, T. at 329.)

51. Patient 2 explained to the Respondent that she was having a lot of back problems,

with pain present throughout her spine. (Test. Patient 2, T. at 329.)

52. Patient 2 further explained to the Respondent that in December 2013, she fellin .

the snow while playing with her son. She thought she might have broken her tailbone when she
fell. She told the Respondent that since that accident, she had been having “really, really bad
pain” that became more pronounced when she sat, coughed or sneezed. (Test. Patient 2, T. at
330.)

53. After Patient 2 explained her symptoms to the Respondent, the Respondent had
Patient 2 lie down on the examination table so he could examine her. He started with leg
exercises, asking Patient 2 whether she was experiencing any pain as she performed the

exercises. (Test. Patient 2, T. at 330.)
54. After the Respondent had Patient 2 perform the leg exercises on the examination
table, he directed her to stand up facing toward the door, The Respondent was behind Patient 2.
The Respondent went on to palpate Patient 2°s spine from her neck to her abdomen. As he
pressed down Patient 2’s spine, he asked Patient 2 if it hurt at each pressure point. Patient 2

- indicated that it did not hurt substantially in the areas where he was pressing, except in the waist
area, (Test. Patient 2, T. at 330.)

55. The Respondent continued pressing downward. When he got to the region where
Patient 2’s buttocks started, he asked Patient 2 to unbutton her blue jeans, so be could palpate
further down Patient 2’s spine. (Test. Patient 2, T. at 331.) .

56. The Respondent grabbed Patient 2’s panties and tried to pull them down. When he
did not have success in doing this, he asked Patient 2 if she could pull them down to the point
that she was exposing her whole buttocks, which would allow him to examine the end of her
spine. Patient 2 complied with this request. (Test. Patient 2, T. at 331.)

57. The Respondent continued to palpate downward until he touched around Patient
2s anal area on the outside only. He was gentle, but he still made Patient 2 feel very
uncomfortable.!* The Respondent asked Patient 2 if his touching hurt, to which Patient 2 replied,
“Not really.” (Test. Patient 2, T. at 331.)

58. The Respondent reached for soie gloves that were available on the sink, placed
them on his hands, and began touching the inside of Patient 2’s anus. He did so without using
any cream or lubricant. (Test. Patient 2, T. at 331.)

59. Patient 2 continued to feel uncomfortable as the Respondent examined her around

her anus, but she did not tell the Respondent about her discomfort. (Test. Patient 2, T. at 332.)

 

12 When Patient 2 testified that she was “uncomfortable,” I understood this to mean that she was uncomfortable
“because she was embarrassed by what the Respondent was doing to her.

15
60. After examining Patient 2’s anus, the Respondent returned to his computer and
began explaining to Patient 2 what her most recent Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) study
had shown. He showed an MRI image to Patient 2 and told her that there was no evidence that
she had ever broken her tailbone. He did note that the MRI image showed there was a water sac
forming around ‘one of Patient 2’s discs and noted that this water sac could have been the source
of Patient 2’s back pain. (Test. Patient 2, T. at 332.)

°61. Patient 2 also complained to the Respondent that she was experiencing foot and
ankle pain. The Respondent told Patient 2 that he could not treat those conditions, but he would
refer her to a podiatrist who would be able to do so. (Test. Patient 2, T. at 332-33.) |

62.. ° Just as Patient 2’s examination was concluding, a nurse knocked at the door of-the
examination room. The nurse communicated through the closed door to the Respondent that
another physician needed him. The Respondent told the nurse that he would be able to see that
doctor in five minutes. (Test, Patient 2, T. at 333.)

63. The Respondent never opened the door while he was speaking to the nurse. (Test.
Patient 2, T. at 333.)

64. Patient 2 sat back down on the examination table while the Respondent was
conversing with the nurse. After he spoke with the nurse, the Respondent rolled the examining
stool over closer to Patient 2 and said, “Can you come over one more time?” (Test. Patient 2, T.
at 333.)

65. The Respondent directed Patient 2 to stand again. He positioned her sideways, so
she would be looking at the side of the wall. He then positioned his legs between Patient 2's legs
and asked Patient 2 to unbutton her jeans one more time, because he wanted to “make sure of

something.” (Test. Patient 2, T. at 333.)
66. | The Respondent assisted Patient 2 with pulling her jeans and panties down to the.
point where her full buttocks was exposed. He put on new gloves, and faced Patient 2. He placed
about one quarter of a finger inside Patient 2’s anus and asked Patient 2 whether it hurt. Patient 2 ~
replied, “Not really.” (Test. Patient 2, T. at 333-34.)

67. . Once the Respondent examined Patient 2’s anus, he ended the examination. He
stood up, removed his gloves and washed his hands at the sink. Patient 2 buttoned her jeans and
sat on the examination table. (Test. Patient 2, T. at 334.) ,

68.  Atno time during any part of his examination of Patient 2 did the Respondent
explain what he was doing or why he was doing it. (Test. Patient 2, T. at 335.)

69. The Respondent ended his visit with Patient 2 by saying, “Okay, it has been a
pleasure. If you have any questions, please contact me.” Both he and Patient 2 left the
examination room at this point. (Test. Patient 2, T. at 334.)

70. The Respondent prescribed prednisone to Patient 2 for the treatment of her back,
based on the results of the August 18,2014 examination. (Test. Patient 2, T. at 340-41; State’s
Ex, 42 at 00045.)

71, Patient 2 went directly to the Ladies’ Room to clean herself with toilet paper,
because she still had the sensation that the Respondent’s finger was in her anus. (Test. Patient 2,
T. at 334.)

72, Patient 2 left the Kaiser medical building, went to her car, and from there, she
called her husband and told him that she thought she had been sexually abused by the
Respondent, because he touched her in her anus and she did not know if he was supposed to have

done that. (Test. Patient 2, T. at 335.)

17
73. Patient 2 continued to feel uncomfortable for the remainder of the day. (Test.
Patient 2, T. at 335.)

74. Soon afterward, Patient 2 received a routine e-mail from the Respondent, which
, acknowledged her visit with him on August 18, 2014. (Test. Patient 2, T. at 339; State’s Ex. 42 at
00045.) . .

75. On September 3,:2014, Patient 2 sent an e-mail to the Respondent. In her e-mail,
Patient 2 explained to the Respondent that she believed that the prednisone that he had
prescribed was causing her to develop a rash that had affected her entire body. She wanted him
to prescribe a medication to her to treat the rash, (Test. Patient 2, T. at 340; State’s Ex. 42 at
00021.) .

76. The Respondent did not answer Patient 2’s e-mail concerning her presumed
prednisone-induced rash. (Test. Patient 2, T. at 340.) °

77. On September 3, 2014, Patient 2 sent a second e-mail to the Respondent. In that e-
mail, Patient 2 wanted to know some more about her spinal problems based on the x-ray studies
he performed of her spine on August 18, 2014. (Test. Patient 2, T. at 341.)

78. The Respondent replied to Patient 2’s second September 3, 2014 e-mail, but did
not answer her questions. (Test. Patient 2, T. at 342; State’s Ex. 42 at 00031.) .

79. On October 3, 2014, at 11:29 a.m., Patient 2 sent another e-mail to the
Respondent as a follow-up to her September 3, 2014 e-mail. The Respondent did not reply.
(Test. Patient 2, T. at 342-43.)

80. On October 15, 204 R.N., sent a return e-mail to Patient 2, in
answer to Patient 2’s October 3, 2014 e-mail, indicating that she would forward Patient 2’s

81. As of October 15, 2014, Patient 2. was also seeking updated records ion ll
concerning a disability claim that she was pursuing. (Test. Patient 2, T. at 360.)

82. On October 15, 2014 at 1:26 p.m., Patient 2 wrote to > fi: an effort to
obtain updated medical records related to her disability claim. (State’s Ex. 43 at 00002.)

83. On October 15, 2014, at 1:56'p.m., Dr. a: a return e-mail to Patient
2, indicating that he was covering for Dr. | day. He advised Patient 2 to e-mail Dr.

Ree he retumed to the office the following Monday and to make an appointment with
him to address her ongoing concems. (State’s Ex. 43 at 00002.)

84. On October 15, 2014, at 3:55 p.m., Patient 2 sent an e-mail to of in reply
to of earlier e-mail. That e-mail stated the following:

Your service is getting worse and worse[.] 1 felt that I was sexually abused by

one of your colleagues, has been hard to know what are my health issues and I

[nave] been asking to update my records since Nov 2013 but nobody has done

anything[.] I e-mail another department and someone told me that it will take

some weeks, after somebody else review it, this is unbelievable[.]

(Test. Patient 2, T. at 344; State’s Ex. 43 at 0002.)

85.  WhenDr. i - back from vacation, he read Patient 2's e-mail, noting
with particularity Patient 2’s allegation of sexual abuse by the Respondent. That allegation
prompted him to call Patient 2 to gather more information. Over the telephone, Patient 2
explained to prin. method that the Respondent used to examine her. pr f>-s
greatly displeased with what he heard and told Patient 2, “He wasn’t supposed to touch you like
that. Nobody is supposed to touch you like that and not even with a chaperone present.” (Test.

Patient 2, T. at 345.)
the ALJ erred by refusing to rule on the motion to quash subpoena and failing to enforce an
active subpoena. Dr. Williams’s exceptions with respect to the enforcement of the subpoena and
questioning related to Facility A’s investigation, exceptions | and 2, are granted.°

Il. Procedural Defects (Exception 3)

During the Board investigator’s testimony, the State objected to Dr. Williams’s questions
pertaining to alleged defects in the Board’s investigation, including questions regarding why
certain witnesses were not interviewed and why certain documents were not obtained. Dr.
Williams argued that the questions should be permitted to challenge the substantive basis for the
charges that were developed as a result of the Board’s investigation. The ALJ concluded that the
questions relating to the Board’s investigation and process by which the charges were formulated
would not be permitted on the basis of Health Occ. 14-405(g), which prohibits the challenge of
any procedural defects alleged to have occurred prior to the filing of charges. The ALJ did,
however, permit Dr. Williams to proffer the testimony he believed he could have elicited if he
was permitted to engage in the line of questioning that was prohibited. Dr. Williams made 29
proffers concerning purported failures or deficiencies in the Board’s investigation. The ALJ
heard the proffers and accepted them into the record.

Health Occ. § 14-405 provides, “[t]he hearing of charges may not be stayed or challenged
by any procedural defects alleged to have occurred prior to the filing of charges.” In analyzing
the scope of Health Occ. § 14-405, the Court of Appeals explained:

To the extent that deficiencies or irregularities in the pre-charge proceedings

actually compromise the accused’s opportunity for a full and fair hearing on the

charges, in conformance with applicable Constitutional, statutory, or other legal

requirements, or suffice in some way to deprive the agency (or court) of true
jurisdiction to proceed, the accused is necessarily entitled, and must be allowed,

° The Facility A subpoena only pertained to documents relating to Patient 1. Rather than remanding this case back to
the ALJ for further proceedings, the Panel will simply not find a violation against Dr. Williams with respect to
Patient 1.
 

 

86. Before he ended the call, >i told Patient 2 that he needed to report what
Patient 2 told him to his supervisor. (Test. Patient 2; T. at 345.)

87. Not long after Patient 2 spoke with pr i: the telephone, of called
Patient 2 back; an unnamed woman employed vy 0 participated in the conversation by ,
conference call. Dr. | the woman informed Patient 2 that the call was being recorded.
They asked Patient 2 what occurred during her examination by the Respondent on August 18,
2014. Patient 2 related everything that happened with regard to the Respondent touching her in ©
areas that she considered inappropriate. (Test. Patient’s 2, T. at 345; State’s Ex. 10 at 34-35.)

88. Later, Dr face another telephone call to Patient 2 and left a message. She
called back later and apologized for not answering the telephone, and explained to Dr. 7”
that she did not answer because she did not want to talk about the incident any further. (Test.

meeting with the Respondent on October 24, 2014 at 7. a. iii

also participated in that meeting. (rest J. at 550; State’s Ex. 37,)

 

93. During the October 24, 2014 meeting, the Respondent denied performing an anal
or rectal examination of Patient 2. When Dr. P| asked the Respondent about
whether he thought of asking for a chaperone, the Respondent avoided the question by replying,
“I explain even more than I did in January. It was very difficult for me to examine people after
the last incident. The nurses cannot leave until I leave at the end of the day whether or not male
or female in case I need a chaperone.” (Test. a: at 550; State's Ex. 37 at 0002.)

94, During the October 24, 2014 meeting, the Respondent also noted that he did not
believe a chaperone was necessary to be present during examinations as long as the patient was
“not fully undressed.” He explained that he only pulled Patient 2’s pants down to the point of the
gluteal fold. The Respondent also noted, with regard to Patient 2, “If 1 was going to do a rectal
exara, I would have told her that I was going to do a rectal exam.” (State’s Ex. 37 at 0002.)

Respondent no TE. terminating his employment. Dr. ie: that

Patient 2’s complaint was the second time in eight months that a female patient had alleged that

the Respondent had inappropriately touched her. In this regard, De since to the

Respondent that the basis for his termination was his failure to use a chaperone during his

21
 

- examination of Patient 2. He averred that, “It shows an incredible lack of judgment to proceed
with an examination without a chaperone.” (Test. a. at 552; State’s Ex. 50.)
97. During the October 28, 2014 meeting, > asked if the Respondent

recalled their earlier conversation about the need to use chaperones. The Respondent nodded in

agreement. oof at 552; State’s Ex. 50.)
98. On November 7, 2014, the Senior Benefits Administrator for P|

sent a letter to the Respondent, verifying the Respondent’s termination from his employment,
effective October 28, 2014, and informing him of medical and dental benefits that might be
available to him after his termination through the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act (COBRA). (State’s Ex. 7 at 071-076.)

Findings with Respect to Patient 38

100. Patient 3 is a forty-eight-year-old woman. She suffers from two medical
conditions, Amold-Chiria Type 2 malformation and degenerated cervical discs, which cause her
to experience severe, chronic and constant back pain. (State’s Bx. 44 at 00001.)

101. An Arnold-Chiria Type 2 malformation is a congenital condition that involves a
malformity around the skull. (Test. Patient 3, T. at 28.)

102. Patient 3 had nuts and bolts implanted in her spine to address the degeneration of

her cervical discs. (Test. Patient 3, T. at 28.)

8 Patients 3 through 7 experienced acts of inappropriate touching by the Respondent votre
terminated the Respondent’s employment. Because these acts of inappropriate touching only became known to the
Board after the Respondent's termination, however, I decided to address them here rather than earlier in my
Proposed Findings of Fact, even though they are chronologically out of sequence.

22
103. The severity of the pain in Patient 3’s back required her to have an intrathecal
pump implanted beneath the skin in her abdomen. An intrathecal pump supplies pain medication
to a patient through a catheter inserted into his or her spine twenty-four hours a day. The
medication comes from a reservoir within the pump. A patient with an intrathecal pump must
obtain periodic refills of the prescription medication for the pump’s reservoir from his or her

" physician, (Test. Patient 3, T. at 29-30.)

104. Atall times relevant, Patient 3 was a member of im (Test. Patient 3, T. at 32.)

105. Before June 2011, Patient 3 had been having her back pain issues treated at | |
me Center, which included having her intrathecal pump prescription refills provided
there, When the Respondent began providing pain management services through a | |

switched Patient 3 to the Respondent, because he was able to provide the same services asf
| (Test. Patient 3, T. at 32.)
106. From June 2011 through December 2013, the Respondent provided pain
management services to Patient 3 without incident. (Test, Patient 3, T. at 35-36, 50.)
107, On December 16, 2013, Patient 3 had ber regular appointment with the
Respondent. The Respondent saw Patient 3 in a small examination room i
| aa The room had a door, but no windows. At that time, the Respondent cleaned
the area of Patient 3’s abdomen where the intrathecal pump was inserted and replaced the pump.
(Test. Patient 3, T. at 36, 48-49.)
108. There was no chaperone in the examination room when the Respondent was
examining Patient 3 on December 16, 2013. Patient 3 did not request a chaperone because she
did not believe the Respondent would be performing a kind of medical examination that would

necessitate the presence of a chaperone. (Test. Patient 3, T. at 37, 49.)

 

4 The Respondent use the word “repatriate” to describe the process of returning patients mm who had been
obtaining health care services from other providers onc| egan providing those same services, He noted that
he was recruited primarily to facilitate the repatriation of pain management patients. (Test. Respondent, T. at 1022.)

23
109. During her December 16, 2013 examination, Patient 3 told the Respondent that
her pain was not being controlled and, in fact, was increasing. She also reported numbness in her
feet. The Respondent replied that he wanted to examine Patient 3, and Patient 3 agreed to the
examination. (Test. Patient 3, T. at 36; State’s Ex. 20 at 11.)

110. . Patient 3 had been sitting on an examination table. The Respondent directed
Patient 3 to get off the table and stand up. He stood behind Patient 3 and had her lower her pants
below her buttocks and began pressing up and down her spine, toward the bones that protrude
from each side of the spinal column. Patient 3’s underwear was below the cheeks of her buttocks.
(Test. Patient 3, T. at 36, 48; State’s Ex. 20 at 20.)

111. The Respondent stood behind Patient 3 and began examining her hips. As he
conducted that examination, he caused Patient 3 discomfort by pressing on a soft spot in her _
pelvic region. A discussion ensued between the Respondent and Patient 3 about whether Patient
3 was experiencing pelvic pain as opposed to hip pain. (Test. Patient 3, T. at 36.)

112. The Respondent then began examining Patient 3 between her legs. He started
pushing up between her legs on both sides and up in between her legs. (Test. Patient 3, T. at 36-
37.)

113. When Patient 3 realized the Respondent was about to put his fingers near her
vagina, she told him, “I do.not like where you’re at.” The Respondent did not stop pressing
around Patient 3’s vaginal region, nor did he say anything about what he was doing or why he
was doing it. (Test. Patient 3, T. at 37.)

114. The Respondent pressed twice on one side of Patient 3’s vagina and then pressed

twice on the other side of it. (Test. Patient 3, T. at 37.)
 

115. The Respondent concluded Patient 3’s examination and left the examination
room. He went to another room. APRoployee brought Patient 3 her paperwork, and Patient
3 left the building. (Test. Patient 3, T. at 38.)

116. After leaving the BR city on December 16, 2013, Patient 3 researched
examination techniques for back pain using the Internet, and discovered that there was no need to
touch the vaginal area during an examination where a female patient describes the kind of back
pain that Patient 3 was experiencing on December 16, 2013. (Test. Patient 3, T. at 39-40; Resp.
Ex. 6.)

117, On February 12, 2014, ‘Patient 3 visited the Respondent it i
office so she could get a medication refill for her intrathecal pump and seek relief for continued
lower back pain. She was also scheduled to get an MRI scan that day. She asked her husband to
accompany her because of the bad experience she had with the Respondent during her December
16, 2013 examination, (Test. Patient 3, T. at 52; State’s Ex. 20 at 41; State’s Ex. 44 at 00048.)

118. On February 12, 2014, although the Respondent talked about measures to ease
Patient 3’s chronic back pain, Patient 3 also confronted the Respondent about the way he .
examined her on December 16, 2013. Patient 3’s husband was in the examination room with
Patient 3 when she confronted the Respondent about his examination techniques. Patient 3
showed the Respondent information from the Internet that demonstrated that the examination
methods that he used on December 16, 2013 were inappropriate. (Test. Patient 3, T. at 40, 51-52;
State’s Ex. 20 at 32.)

119. On February 12, 2014, the Patient and the Respondent also engaged in a
discussion about the propriety of having an MRI scan done that day. Patient 3 was fearful that
the MRI equipment might empty the medication from her intrathecal pump’s reservoir. Although

the Respondent attempted to convince Patient 3 that having an MRI would not affect her pump,

25
she and the Respondent agreed to delay the MRI scan to allow her intrathecal pump to empty.
Patient 3 ultimately had her MRI scan performed on February 24, 2014, (Test. Patient 3, T. at
70-71; State’s Ex. 44 at 00048, 00055.)

120. The Respondent also examined Patient 3 on February 24, 2014. (State’s Ex. 44 at
00073.) -

121. After the February 24, 2014 visit, Patient 3 had additional medical visits with the
Respondent on April 28, 2014, June 30, 2014 and September 3, 2014.5 (Test. Patient 3, T. at 75;
State’s Ex. 44 at 00147, 00170-00171, and 00199.)

122. A few months after the December 16, 2013 incident, Patient 3 spoke to her
primary caregiver, Dr. i: the way the Respondent examined her on that
date, Drltold Patient 3 that it “as between him and I [sic], and I should go back and talk

to him.” (Test. Patient 3, T. at 53.)

123. Later in 2014, after the Respondent’s termination ion Patient 3
visited a BR. specialist, iim i a She told Dr.

ow the Respondent examined her on December 16, 2013, focusing on the Respondent’s
act of touching her vagina and surrounding region. In response to Patient 3’s description of what
the Respondent did on that date, DAE scicates that he did not believe the Respondent’ s

examination techniques were appropriate, !® (Test, Patient 3, T. at 53-54.)

'S When the Respondent's counsel cross-examined Patient 3, she listed the February date as the 28th, not the 24th
and the September date as the 9th, not the 3rd when she asked Patient 3 whether she had seen the Respondent on
specific dates. Patient 3, in response to counsel’s questioning, agreed that she had seen the Respondent on all of the
dates that the Respondent’s counsel had recited. Despite Patient 3’s answer in the affirmative to two erroneous dates,
Patient 3’s medical records, found at State’s Exhibit No. 44 and Respondent No. 23, show that February 24, 2014
and September 3, 2014 are the correct dates.

16 According to Patient 3, Dr ii: specific reply was, “Well, no I don’t know you that well.” (Test. Patient 3,
T. at 54.) :

26
124, On May 13, 2015, Patient 3 notified the Virginia Department of Health
Professions that the Respondent inappropriately touched her on December 16, 2013. Virginia
subsequently referred Patient 35 case to the Board, because the Respondent’s reported
misconduct occurred in Maryland. (Test. Patient 3, T. at 55~56, State’s Ex. 11 at 000005—
000012.) ‘

Findings with Respect to Patient 4

125. Patient 4isa forty-four-year-old woman and a member i She was
formerly employed by oe 0p. Police Department. She began
experiencing back pain in 2004, after slipping on ice and injuring her lumbar spine. In 2010,
Patient 4 had an accident at work; an elevator malfunctioned and dropped her to the basement."
That accident aggravated Patient 4’s lumbar spine injury from 2004 and caused an additional
injury to Patient 4’s cervical spine. (Test. Patient 4, T. at 404-05; State’s Ex. 46 at 000925.)

126. ° Patient 4°s back pain is chronic and severe. It affects both her lumbar and cervical
spines, with pain radiating to Patient a's left upper buttock, down her left leg and into. the heel of
her left foot, including her toes. It also radiates from Patient 4’s neck to her left shoulder, the
upper left part of her back and down her left arm into her left hand and fingers. (Test. Patient 4,
T. at 405.)

127. From 2004 through 2014, Patient 4 received treatment for her spine injuries and
back pain that included nerve blocks, epidural steroid injections in both the lumbar and cervical
regions of the spine, acupuncture, three rounds of physical therapy and aquatherapy. (Test.

Patient 4, T. at 406.)

EE

" Patient 4 testified that the elevator dropped her “below the basement.” (Test. Patient 4, T. at 404.) “To the
basement” is probably what she meant.
 

128. . On April 1, 2014, Patient 4 visited the Respondent for the first time. Patient 4’s
primary care physician, > ii had referred Patient 4 to the Respondent because he
deemed her in need of pain management services to address her chronic back pain. (Test. Patient
4, T. at 407; State’s Ex. 12 at 14; State’s Ex. 46 at 000925-000927.)

129. On April 1, 2014, the Respondent examined Patient 4 cia
Office Building. During the examination, the Respondent checked Patient 4’s spine and the
strength of her arms and legs. Patient 4 described to the Respondent all the treatment she had had
up to the time of her appointment with him. (Test. Patient 4, T. at 408; State’s Ex. 46 at 000926.)

130. During the April 1, 2014 examination, Patient 4 told the Respondent that she
recently had an MRI scan of her cervical spine. The Respondent suggested that Patient 4 also
have an MRI scan of her lumbar spine. Patient 4 and the Respondent also talked about lumbar
and cervical injections. (Test Patient 4, T. at 408; State’s Ex. 46 at 000927.)

131. Patient 4 agreed to have a caudal!® epidural steroid injection of her lumbar spine.
She scheduled that procedure for May 8, 2014, at Es cica Office Building. (Test.
Patient 4 at 408; State’s Ex. 46 at 001619.)

132. No chaperone was present in the examination room when the Respondent
examined Patient 4 on April 1, 2014. (Test. Patient 4 at 408.)

133. On May 8, 2014, Patient 4 appeared TRE ii for the caudal
epidural steroid injection of her lumbar spine. She signed the informed consent form and

prepared for the procedure immediately after arrival. (Patient 4, T. at 409.)

18 4 “caudal injection” means an injection that goes into the epidural space to address pain that is radicular. The

a: is into the sacral hiatus and the commu (ie e., the opening leading into the epidural space). (Test.
T. at 978.)

28
134. The Respondent performed the caudal epidural steroid injection” of Patient 4’s
lumbar spine by having Patient 4 lie face down on the bed located in an examination room. He
directed Patient 4 to lower the sweatpants and underwear that she was wearing such that she
exposed her entire buttocks. (Test. Patient 4, T. at 408-09; State’s Ex. 12 at 18-23.)

135. The Respondent explained to Patient 4 that he would use an ultrasound device to
locate the injection site. He noted that he would numb that area first. Patient 4’s main concern at
this point was whether the injection would be painful. She asked the Respondent whether the
injection would burt. He replied, “You will feel a pinch.” (Test. Patient 4, T. at 410.)

136. When the Respondent started the procedure, he spread the cheeks of Patient 4’s
buttocks and pushed and poked with his finger. As the Respondent manipulated Patient 4’s
buttocks, Patient 4 told the Respondent, “No doctor has ever gone this far before. I’ve had these
injections done before no doctor has ever gone down this far.” The Respondent replied that he
was trying to get as close to the nerve as possible. (Test. Patient 4, T. at 410; State’s Ex. 12 at
21-23.)

137. The Respondent gave Patient 4 the caudal epidural steroid injection in between
her buttocks, inside the gluteal cleft, just above the anus. (Test. Patient 4, T. at 410-11; State’s
Ex, 12 at 24-25.) .

138. On May 8, 2014, no chaperone or other staff members were present in the room
- when the Respondent injected Patient 4 in between her buttocks. (Test. Patient 4; T. at 412, 416.)

139. On May 8, 2014, and immediately afterwards, Patient 4 expressed unease and
displeasure to her daughter and Friend | about how the Respondent chose a site in between her

buttocks to perform the caudal epidural steroid inj ection. At that time, neither Patient 4’s

to raise those deficiencies or irregularities, notwithstanding the statute or rule.
Beyond that, however, the statute means what it says and must be given effect.

Board of Physician Quality Assur. v. Levitsky, 353 Md. 188, 206 (1999).

Dr. Williams argues that the ALJ erred in refusing to allow him to cross examine the
Board’s investigator regarding alleged deficiencies in the Board’s investigation. Dr. Williams
contends that he should have been permitted to question the Board’s investigator about facts and
witnesses she had not developed to establish that there was potentially exculpatory information
that was missing from the Board’s investigation.

The Panel agrees with Dr. Williams that alleged deficiencies in the Board’s investigation
are not procedural defects and, therefore, Health Occ. § 14-405 is not applicable. The ALJ erred
by disallowing questioning regarding the sufficiency of the Board’s investigation on the basis of
Health Occ. § 14-405. Dr. Williams’s exception in that respect is granted.

The Panel, however, finds that Dr. Williams had the opportunity to subpoena witnesses
who were not called or interviewed by the Board and to explore any evidence that he deemed
was missing from the Board’s investigation in his own case in chief. Any alleged deficiencies in
the Board’s investigation have no bearing on this Panel’s ultimate determination regarding the
sufficiency of the evidence to support the charges. The Panel bases its findings on the evidence
contained in the record, not the lack thereof. Accordingly, Dr. Williams has suffered no prejudice
from the lack of cross-examination of the Board’s investigator on the line of questioning at issue,
and, therefore, it is not necessary to remand for further proceedings.

I. Hearsay Statements (Exception 4)

During the testimony of the Board’s investigator, the State sought to admit the complaint

filed by Patient 7, medical records of Patient 7, and transcript of Patient 7’s interview with the

Board investigator. Dr. Williams objected because Patient 7 would not be testifying at the
 

daughter nor Friend 1 took Patient 4’s complaints about the Respondent seriously. (Test. Patient
4 at 419; Test. Friend 1 at 472-74; State’s Ex, 12 at 53-54.)

140. On July 24, 2014, Patient 4 returned to me. to have the
Respondent perform an epidural steroid injection in her cervical spine. Because of ber prior
experience with the Respondent, Patient 4 returned to the Respondent with some reluctance. She
ultimately decided to allow him to give her an epidural steroid injection because she wanted
relief from her back pain. (Test. Patient 4; T. at 415, 420; State’s Ex. 46 at 001619.)

141. On July 24, 2014, a nurse assisted the Respondent when he performed the ,
epidural steroid injection in Patient 4’s cervical spine. That procedure went forward without
incident. (Test. Patient 4; T. at 416, 422; State’s Ex. 46 at 001002001005.)

142. Onor about April 12, 2016, Friend 1 called Patient 4 to tell her that the Channel
9 news”! was reporting that the Respondent had been brought up on charges for molesting his
patients. Patient 4 performed an Internet search using Google to verify that the Respondent was,
in fact, the physician brought up on these charges. (Test. Patient 4, T. at 424-26, 433-34.)

143, Patient 4 located an article on the Internet that described the charges that the
Board had filed against the Respondent up to that time; that article also provided the telephone
number of Administrative Prosecutor Victoria Pepper. Remembering her experience from 2014
and believing that that the way the Respondent performed the caudal steroid injection in between
her buttocks on May 8, 2014 constituted possible misconduct by him, Patient 4 left a message for
Ms. Pepper. She left that message because it was after business hours and all State offices were

closed. (Test. Patient 4, T. at 425-26.)

?° According to Patient 4, her original attempt at submitting her complaint by facsimile failed, and Board
Investigator Doreen Noppinger asked her to resubmit it by scanning it and then sending it. Ms. Noppinger was
responding to the telephone message that Patient 4 left for Ms. Pepper. (Test. Patient 4, T. at 426.) Therefore, Patient
4 surmised that she most likely received the call from Friend 1 on April 12, 2016. (Test. Patient 4, T. at 433.)

*! Friend 1 identified Fox 5 as the television station that broadcast the news report about the Respondent’s alleged
misconduct. (Test. Friend 1, T. at 475.)

144. Patient 4 also went to the Board's website, printed out a complaint form, wrote a
statement describing the Respondent’s misconduct on May 8, 2014, and on April 13, 2016, she
sent it by facsimile to the Board, That submission did not reach the Board, although a later,
scanned version of her complaint form did, (Test. Patient 4, T at 425-26; State’s Ex. 24.)
Findings with Respect to Patient 5 .

145. Patient 5 is a fifty-three-year-old woman, who is a member of: began
visiting the Respondent for back-related pain management treatments in 2013. (Test. Patient 5,
T. at 112; State’s Ex. 47 at 001468.) .

146, Patient 5 worked in a variety of capacities for a bank and an auto dealership. She
then briefly worked as a cosmetologist at | Force Base. She had to stop working in
2008 when she became disabled. (Test. Patient 5, T. at 110.)

147, In 2008, Patient 5 was diagnosed with lumbar displacement. This condition
resulted in Patient 5 experiencing severe back pain, which required her to receive treatments
such as cortisone injections and nerve burning, to help ease that pain. Despite receiving those
treatments, Patient 5 continued to experience chronic and severe back pain. (Test. Patient 5; T. at
110; State’s Ex. 14 at 40.)

148. Patient 5 became familiar with the Respondent because he treated her husband to

help him deal with pain in his clavicle. (Test. Patient 5; T. at 112.)

149. ‘On November 27, 2013, Patient 5 saw the Respondent at Fs
Medical Office Building as a follow-up visit. The visit occurred in an examination room. The
visit began with Patient 5 and the Respondent conversing about whether treatments that the
Respondent had prescribed for Patient 5 had been effective. (Test. Patient 5, T. at 115, 147, 155;

State’s Ex. 47 at 001512.)
150. After their conversation, the Respondent examined Patient 5. He directed Patient
5 to lie down on the examination table and pull down her pants and panties to the point just
above the crack in her buttocks. (Test. Patient 5, T. at 116; State’s Ex. 14 at 18-20.)

151. When he started examining Patient 5, Respondent began by squeezing Patient 5’s
legs hard, asking Patient 5 if it hurt as he squeezed or pressed down on certain parts of her legs.
(Test. Patient 5, T. at 116.) ,

152. The Respondent continued squeezing Patient 5’s legs moving upward toward her
buttocks. He continued moying up until he reached an area close to Patient 5’s rectal area (ie.,
anus). He also got close to Patient 5’s vagina. (Test. Patient 5, T. at 116.)

153. The Respondent also began squeezing Patient 5’s thigh. (State’s Ex. 14 at 4-5,
18.)

154. When the Respondent had finished examining Patient 5 on November 27, 2013,
he asked Patient 5 whether she wanted to get another cortisone injection, and she told him, yes,
she wanted one. (Test. Patient 5; T. at 117.) .

155. Because the Respondent had. examined her in her rectal/anal and vagina areas,
Patient 5 felt weird and uncomfortable after the examination had concluded, Patient 5 did not
expect the Respondent to examine her in those areas of her body. Additionally, the Respondent
had never examined Patient 5 while she was lying on her stomach during previous visits. (Test. -
Patient 5; T. at 117-18.)

156. No chaperone was present in the examination room on November 27, 2013 when
the Respondent examined Patient 5. Patient 5 did not request a chaperone on that occasion,
because she did not believe one was necessary since she was not having a gynecological

examination. (Test. Patient 5; T. at 118-19.)
157. The door to the examination room was closed at all times on November 27, 2013
when the Respondent examined Patient 5. (State’ s Ex. 14 at 28.) .

158, Patient 5 continued to visit the Respondent after November 27, 2013, because she
needed to receive treatment for her back pain, such as epidural steroid injections. (Test. Patient 5,
T. at 119; State’s Ex. 47 at 001528-001533, 001558001566, 001597001601, 001629-001637.)

159. On April 15, 2016, Patient 5 filed a written complaint with the Board, because her
adult daughter had alerted her that she had s seen a television news story about the Respondent’s
alleged misconduct involving inappropriate touching of female patients. Based on the
- Respondent’s behavior on November 27, 2013, Patient 5 believed that the Respondent had
inappropriately touched her on that date as well. (Test. Patient 5, T. at 119, 131.)

160. Patient 5 suffers from bipolar disorder and experienced a sexual assault as a
young child, The realization that the Respondent had inappropriately touched her in the sexual
regions of her body caused Patient 5 to experience severe anxiety and required her to seek sexual
assault counseling on a weekly basis. (Test. Patient 5, T. at 131-32, 137-40; State’s Ex. 47 at
001556.)

Findings with Respect to Patient 6

161. Patient 6 is a fifty-eight-year-old woman. She has been a phlebotomist since the
1980s. She began working | in December 1993 as a phlebotomist, but sometime later,
she began working i tilization Management Operation Center (UMOC) in an
administrative capacity. She is a member es (Test. Patient 6 T. at 487.)

162. Patient 6 began seeing the Respondent for pain management in May 2011. (Test.

Patient 6, T. at 489-90.)
163. Patient 6 found the Respondent’s approach to pain management attractive to her,
because he ‘was the only physician she knew of who sedated patients when performing epidural
injections. (Test Patient 6, T. at 492.)

164. During an examination that occurred sometime between 2012 and 2014, Patient 6
visited the Respondent at one o: medical office buildings for treatment of lower left-side
back pain. (Test. Patient 6; T. at 491.)

165. The Respondent examined Patient 6 during one visit in which Patient 6 was
seeking treatment for lower left-side back pain. On that occasion, he directed Patient 6 to lower
her jeans until part of her buttocks was exposed. After Patient 6 lowered her jeans, the
Respondent started pressing in the middle of Patient 6’s back and continued pressing down her
spine until he reached Patient 6’s buttocks. Once at Patient 6’s buttocks, the Respondent began”
groping them. (Test. Patient 6, T. at 491-92.)

166. No chaperone was present during the examination in which the Respondent
groped Patient 6’s buttocks, (Test. Patient 6, T. at 492.)

167. On another occasion, Patient 6 also presented to the Respondent for the treatment
of back pain. The Respondent examined Patient 6 in a manner similar to the previous visit, but
during this examination, he brushed against Patient 6’s clitoris with his thumb. (Test. Patient 6,
T. at 492-94.) .

168. The Respondent never wore gloves when he examined Patient 6. (Test. Patient 6,
T. at 492.):

169. Patient 6 did not complain to anyone about the Respondent’s conduct at the time
that he groped her buttocks and brushed her clitoris with his thumb, because she trusted him and
thought she was misinterpreting what he was doing, believing her fears unfounded, (Test. Patient

6, T. at 490, 492.)
170. Before she filed a complaint with the Board, Patient 6 had an overall favorable
opinion of the Respondent, so much so that she invited him to her daughter’s wedding in April
2014. (Test. Patient 6, T. at 497-98, 527; State’s Ex. 33 at 00035 »)

171. Patient 6 filed a complaint against the Respondent with the Board on April 25,
2016. (State’s Ex. 26.)

Findings with Respect to Patient 7

172. Patient 7 is a forty-year-old woman. She suffers from lower back pain. As of May -
2013, she had been seeing the Respondent for pain management treatments for approximately
two years. She usually visited him once every three months.” (State’s Ex. 17 at 3, 5.) _

173. On May 28, 2013, Patient 7, accompanied by her five-year-old daughter, went to
a cility”® to get a hard copy of a prescription refill from the Respondent. She had her

vital signs taken at that location, but was told that the Respondent had an emergency and was not

 
 

there; he was edical Office Building. (State’s Ex. 17 at 4.)

174. edical Office Building to get the hard

copy of the prescription refill from the Respondent. (State’s Ex. 17 at 4)

 

The State issued a subpoena for Patient 7 to testify at the hearing, but she failed to appear. According to Ms.
McSherry, Patient 7 was incarcerated at the Charles County Detention Center on November 16, 2016, the date she
was scheduled to appear. (T. at 746.) Although no one verified Patient 7’s incarceration, the State's counsel, Ms.
Pepper, did acknowledge that Patient 7 had been incarcerated previously. (T. at 746-47.) Consequently, I am relying
on the information that Patient 7 provided during her Board interview with Ms. Noppinger on May 4, 2016 as the

primary source for my findings of fact regarding the Respondent’s interactions with Patient 7.

When Patient 7 provided her statement to Ms. Noppinger, she identified the location where she originally arrived
to see the Respondent edical Office Buildi e Respondent strongly disputes the truth of this
testimony.. When he test Respondent noted that lity had not expanded as a “hub” to

provide enhanced medical services, such as = care Or A July 8, 2013. Moreover, the Respondent ~

   
   
    
    
    
   
   
    
 
 

maintains that he did not see any patients in ‘acility until it was a bub, (Test. Respondent, T. at 1024.)
The Respondent also offered a press release to buttress his testj (Resp. Ex. 22.) That press release clearly
establishes the opening o s Medical Office Building ; ahub on July 8, 2013. The Respondent
contends, therefore, that P' *s assertion that she went to in nm May 28, 2013 demonstrates that
she was not telling the truth, because he would not have seen patients there two months later. Because Patient 7
continued to seek treatment from the Respondent after the facility opened, however, she could have been
confused about where she visited him on the date in questi sequently, I do not find her identification of the
place where she went to see the Respondent “ae significant that it completely discredits her. Moreover,
Patient 7’s medical records, and e-mails contai those records, verify May 28, 2013 as a date when the

Respondent examined Patient 7 as well as Patient 7’s concerns about the way the Respondent examined her on that
date, (State’s Ex. 49 at 00007-00011.)

175. When Patient 7 arrived TE «2 0% Building on May

28, 2013; a physician’s assistant took her to the examination room, and the Respondent came to
see her. The Respondent asked Patient 1 how she was doing, and Patient 7 told him she was still
having pain in her lower back. She emphasized that she was actually having more pain on her
right side. (State’s Ex. 17 at 5.) |

' 176, Patient 7 demonstrated to the Respondent where the pain in her lower back was
located using her hand to point to the site of her pain. (State’s Ex. 17 at 5.)

177.. After Patient 7 described where her pain was, the Respondent sat in an ordinary
chair and directed Patient 7 to stand up in front of him. He positioned Patient 7 so that she was
facing her daughter, who was in the room with her. He then pulled Patient 7’s underwear and
pants down to a point just below Patient 7’s buttocks. (State’s Ex. 17 at 5.) .

@ #478. The Respondent began poking Patient 7’s lower back, where she told him the pain
started. She also noted that the pain shot down the back of her right leg. The Respondent then

. Started poking gt Patient 7’s buttogks, and continued down Patient 7’s right leg. (State’s Ex. 17 at
5.)

179. As the examination continued, the Respondent asked Patient 7-whether she had
any pain on her left side. Patient 7 gave no answer, but the Respondent proceeded to poke down
Patient 7’s left leg, starting with her buttocks, in the same way he did with her right leg. (State’s
Ex. 17 at 5.) .

180. While he was examining Patient 7 in the area surrounding her buttocks, the
Respondent poked around the side of Patient 7’s buttocks, squeezing it, and asking if Patient 7
felt any pain there. The Respondent's thumbs were in an area close to Patient 7’s vagina while

squeezing Patient 7’s buttocks. (State’s Ex. 17 at 5-6.)
181. Patient 7 felt uncomfortable with the Respondent’s examination of her buttocks,
because his thumbs were so close to her vagina. (State's Ex. 17 at 6.) |

182. After the Respondent finished examining Patient 7, he started to pull up Patient
7’s underwear, but Patient 7 quickly pulled them up herself. (State’s Ex. 17 at.6.)

183. The Respondent explained’to Patient 7 that he would be scheduling an x-ray for
her because he believed that her pain might be getting worse and he wanted to find out why. He
left the examination room, returned with the hard copy of Patient 7’s prescription refill, and

exited the room. (State’s Ex. 17 at 6.)

184. On May 28, 2013, there was no chaperone in the room with Patient 7 while the
Respondent examined her. (State's Bx. 17 at 20.)

185. On the way home from her visit with the Respondent on May 28, 2013, Patient 7
called her husband and told hira that she was uncomfortable with the way the Respondent
examined her. She told him, “It just didn’t feel right.” (State’s Ex. 17 at 6.)

186. On May 30, 2013, Patient 7 e-mailed and called a: physician’s
assistant who escorted her into the examination room the previous day. When she spoke with
Ms. ver the telephone, Patient 7 told Mo I os she wanted an explanation
concerning the lumbar spine examination that the Respondent performed on her the previous
day. Msi viewed the examination notes with Patient 7 over the telephone and provided
the name of the examination the Respondent performed, but Patient 7 indicated she was not
satisfied with that review. She wanted to speak with the Respondent personally. vs
advised Patient 7 to message the Respondent, but Patient 7 indicated that she could not find his

messaging information “_ website. (State’s Ex. 17 at 7-8; State’s Ex. 49 at 00007.)

188, On June 3, 2013, having received no additional response from the Respondent
through her communications with Mision 7 found an e-mail address for the
Respondent and sent him the following e-mail message with regard to the examination he
performed on her on May 28, 2013:

I would like to have a list of the names of the exams that you performed

during my visit. Specifically the last exam where you pull down my underwear,

put on gloves and squeeze my buttocks. That exam was VERY uncomfortable [;]

Ihave NEVER had a doctor performed that exam, and I would like to know the

name of it AND the purpose.

(State’s Ex. 49 at 00010.)

189, On June 4, 2013, the Respondent called Patient 7 to discuss her e-mail message. °
Patient 7 asked the Respondent what type of examination he performed, and he provided the
same name of the examination that Ue given her. Patient 7 told the Respondent she
viewed the example of that kind of examination on YouTube, and that was not the kind of
examination that the Respondent had performed. The Respondent did not address Patient 7’s
question and, went on to discuss the x-ray referral that he made on May 28, 2013. (State’s Ex. 17:
at 9.) .

190. The Respondent made no notes concerning his telephone conversation with
Patient 7 on June 4, 2013 in Patient 7’s medical record. (State’s Ex. 49 at 00011.)

hearing and, therefore, would not be available for cross-examination or for the ALJ to assess the
witness’s credibility. Dr. Williams did not subpoena Patient 7 or otherwise attempt to secure her
presence at the hearing. The ALJ determined that the hearsay evidence was sufficiently reliable
and admitted the documents pertaining to Patient 7 over Dr. Williams’s objections. Dr. Williams
argues that the ALJ erred in admitting the hearsay statements of Patient 7 and documents
concerning Patient 7 through the Board’s investigator because Patient 7 did not testify at the
OAH hearing.

“[W]ithin the context of administrative proceedings, it is well-settled that administrative
agencies are not bound by technical common law rules of evidence.” Para v. 1691 Ltd. P’ship,
211 Md. App. 335, 379 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Administrative Procedure
Act provides that “[e]vidence may not be excluded solely on the basis that it is hearsay.” Md.
Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-213(c). Further, “[a]lthough we recognize the basic tenet of fairness
in administrative adjudications is the requirement of an opportunity for reasonable cross-
examination, fairness also requires the complaining party to avail itself of the opportunity to
cross-examine.” Para, 211 Md. App. at 384 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). “As
a consequence, the complaining party must subpoena testimony or a witness of the production of
any evidence when the administrative proceeding permits.” Jd. In this case, Dr. Williams did not
subpoena Patient 7 to testify at the hearing or attempt to conduct a deposition or interview of the
patient prior to the OAH hearing. Dr. Williams had the opportunity to cross-examine the Board
investigator regarding Patient 7 and called other witnesses to discredit the testimony of Patient 7.

The Panel agrees with the ALJ that the transcript of Patient 7’s interview was properly
admitted, but gives the evidence little weight based on the inconsistencies in Patient 7’s story and

the inability for both parties to question Patient 7 about the inconsistencies at the OAH hearing.
 

199. The BB vica%00 required the Respondent to answer the following
questions pertinent to whether he had been disciplined by any other healthcare organization:
Have any of the following ever been, or are currently in process, either on
a voluntary or involuntary basis: denied, revoked, suspended, reduced,

limited, placed on probation, not renewed or relinquished for disciplinary
reasons?

6. Membership on any hospital/medical staff?

10. Participation in any other healthcare organization (surgicenter,
managed care, PPO, PHO, MSO, etc.)

202. In Maryland, physicians’ licenses are subject to renewal every two years. On
August 10, 2015, the Respondent submitted his physicians license renewal application (Renewal
Application) electronically to the Board. (State’s Ex. 39.)

203. Under Question 6, related to “Character and Fitness,” the Renewal Application
required the Respondent to answer the following:

The following questions pertain to the period since July 1, 2013. If this is your first
renewal, these questions apply to the period commencing with the date of your initial

- DISCUSSION
L The Law and Introduction.

The State charged the Respondent with violating various provisions of the Act, Health
Occ. §§ 14-101 through 14-416 (2014-& Supp. 2016), and associated Code of Maryland
Regulations (COMAR) sections related to sexual misconduct by physicians, specifically,
COMAR 10.32.17.01 through .03. In essence, the State charged the Respondent with violating
provisions of the Act and COMAR by inappropriately touching seven female patients in such a

way that it constituted sexual misconduct. It also charged the Respondent with violating the Act
by willfully making or filing false reports in the practice of medicine and willfully making a false
representation when seeking or making an application for licensure. (State’s Ex. 51.)

The State cited the following legal authority as the basis for its charges:

Health Occupations sections 14-404(a)(3)() and (ii), (11) and G 6), which state:

(a) Subject to the hearing provisions of § 14-405 of this subtitle, [the Board], on
the affirmative vote of a majority of the quorum .. ., may reprimand any licensee,
place any licensee on probation, or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee:

G) Is guilty of:
(i) Immoral conduct in the practice of medicine;”* or

(ii) Unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine;?>

a 1) Willfully makes or files a false report or record in the practice of
medicine; [or]

(36) Willfully makes a false representation when seeking or making
application for licensure or any other application related to the practice of
medicine....

.01. Scope.

This chapter prohibits sexual misconduct against patients or key third parties by
individuals licensed or certified under Health Occupations Article, Titles 14 and
15, Annotated Code of Maryland.

02. Definitions.

A. In this chapter, the following terms have the meanings indicated.

* The meaning of terms such as ‘immoral conduct’ . . . is determined by the ‘common judgment’ of the profession
as found by the professional licensing board.” Finucan v. Md. Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance, 380 Md. 577,
593 (2004). : :

5 Unprofessional conduct “refers to ‘conduct which breaches the rules or ethical code of a profession, or conduct
which is unbecoming a member in good standing of a profession.” Jd. (citing Shea v. Bd. of Med. Exam’rs, 146 Cal.
Rptr. 653, 660 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1978)).

B. Terms Defined.

(2) Sexual Impropriety.

(a) “Sexual impropriety” means behavior, gestures, or expressions that are
seductive, sexually suggestive, or sexually demeaning to a patient or a key third
party regardless of whether the sexual impropriety occurs inside or outside of a
professional setting.

(b) “Sexual impropriety” includes, but is not limited to:
(i) Failure to provide privacy for disrobing;
(ii) Performing a pelvic or rectal examination without the use of gloves;

(iii) Using the health care practitioner-patient relationship to initiate or
solicit a dating, romantic, or sexual relationship; and

(iv) Initiation by the health care practitioner of conversation regarding the
health care practitioner’s sexual problems, sexual likes or dislikes, or fantasies.

(3) “Sexual misconduct” means a health care practitioner’s behavior toward a
patient, former patient, or key third party, which includes:

(a) Sexual impropriety;
(b) Sexual violation;

(4) Sexual Violation.

(a) “Sexual violation” means health care practitioner-patient or key third
party sex, whether or not initiated by the patient or key third party, and engaging
in any conduct with a patient or key third party that is sexual or may be
reasonably interpreted as sexual, regardless of whether the sexual violation occurs”

inside or outside of a professional setting.

(b) “Sexual violation” includes, but is not limited to:

(v) Touching the patient’s breasts, genitals, or any sexualized body part;

.03. Sexual Misconduct.
A. Individuals licensed or certified under Health Occupations Article, Titles 14

B. Health Occupations Article, §§14-404(a)(3) and 15-314(3), Annotated Code

of Maryland, includes, but is not limited to, sexual misconduct. ‘

As the moving party, the State has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the
evidence. Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-217 (2014); Comm’r of Labor & Indus. v. Bethlehem
Steel Corp., 344 Md. 17, 34 (1996).

- After considering all of the evidence presented in light of the applicable legal authority, I
conclude that the State has met its burden of proof on all charges. It demonstrated that the
Respondent is subject to sanction under section 14-404(a)(3)(i) and (ii) of the Act, because he
was guilty of immoral and unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine. That immoral and
unprofessional conduct involved his engaging in “sexual impropriety” as defined by COMAR
10.32.17.02B(2)(a) and (b)(ii), and “sexual violation(s)” as defined by 10.32.17.02B(4)(a) and
(b)(v), both of which constitute “sexual misconduct,” as defined by COMAR 10.32.17.02B(3),
with regard to acts of sexualized touching that he committed while examining Patients 1 through

7. The State also demonstrated that the Respondent is subject to sanction under section 14-

404(a)(11) of the Act for willfully failing to disclose his termination from a.
his July 29, 2015 application for reappointment FO It further demonstrated

that the Respondent is subject to sanction under section 14-404(a)(36) of the Act for willfully
failing to disclose his termination ion... his August 10, 2015 physicians
renewal application. The evidence that the Respondent provided in his defense, including his
own testimony, does not refute or even mitigate the seriousness of the charges brought against

him by the Board.
I will address the following: (a) the Respondent’s assertion ‘that alleged deficiencies in
the Board’s investigation and charging document prejudiced him such that he was denied due
process, which I have concluded is not the case; (b) the Respondent’s conduct vis-a-vis each
patient as it relates to section 14-404(a)(3)(i) and (ii) of the Acts and (c) the Respondent’s false
reports/misrepresentations as they relate to section 14-404(a)(11) and (36), After I conclude
those discussions, { will turn to the sanction that I believe the Board should adopt.

0. ' Alleged Deficiencies in the Board’s Investigation and Charging Document.

From the preliminary stages of this proceeding—and during the hearing itself—the
. Respondent steadfastly asserts that the Board conducted an inadequate and incomplete
investigation. He maintains that the Board’s deficient investigation prejudiced him and, thus,
denied him due process, The Respondent further asserts that the State’s amendment of the
already “Amended Charges” during the hearing process also prejudiced him because he could
not adequately defend himself against charges that continuously changed. The State counters that
whatever took place during the investigatory phase of this proceeding could not have prejudiced
the Respondent, because the law precludes any attack on what occurred during the investigatory
process. (See below.) Moreover, the State avers that its corrections to the Amended Charges also
could not have prejudiced the Respondent because, during the hearing, the State only withdrew
certain charges or modified them to comport with the evidence. It did so when it discovered that
witness testimony did not support the Board’s charges as written. (The State did not add any
charges.)

With regard to the Respondent’s contention that the Board’s inadequate or incomplete
investigation prejudiced him, section 14-405(g) of the Act states, “The hearing of charges may
not be stayed or challenged by any procedural defects alleged to have occurred prior to the filing

of charges.” Health Occ, § 14-405(g) (2014).
The Respondent, however, argues that flaws in the Board’s investigation process, the
process that formed the basis of the charges that the State pursued during the hearing, prejudiced
him, so much so, that his ability to have a fair hearing was irreparably undermined. He maintains
the Boards investigation was deficient in two fundamental ways:

° The allegations of the complainant/patients are not supported by
any contemporaneous corroboration.

° The Board’s investigation lacked impartiality.
The Respondent cites Rosov v. Maryland Board of Dental Examiners, 163 Md. App. 98
(2005), in support of his argument.”° With regard to Rosov, the Respondent’s counsel argues,
“[TJhere’s information in that case that indicates that the investigation here was deficierit and
deficient in a way that does impact [the Respondent’s] due process rights as he is sitting here
today defending his livelihood and his ability to practice medicine in Maryland.” (T. at 1457.) 1
cannot discern what information the Respondent is referring to in Rosov. In Rosov, the
respondent-dentist’s major complaint was that Maria Bartrem, the Dental Board’s investigator,
‘was not present at the hearing and, therefore, could not authenticate her report. Dr. Rosov noted
“that such an unauthenticated hearsay report would be inadmissible in a judicial trial. Rosov, 163
Md, App. at 115. The Court of Special Appeals agreed with that assertion, but noted that the
respondent-dentist was participating in an administrative hearing, not a judicial trial. Therefore,
the investigator’s report was admissible under the relaxed rules of evidence that apply in
administrative proceedings. Id.
, The respondent-dentist in Rosov also contended, “[T]he report reveals Bartrem’s biased
viewpoint, and cites ‘major defects in the manner of the investigation, including the participation
of the State but not Dr. Rosov, the documentation of the investigation, the manner of how
6 The Respondent also cited MacKoul v, Maryland State Board of Physicians, No. 2607, 2016 WL 281592 (Mad. Ct.

Spec. App. Jan, 20, 2016) (Unreported), for the proposition that a charged physician must show prejudice to
establish a due process challenge.

46
conclusions were reached, etc.” Jd. The court rejected the Respondent’s contention and stated
the following in doing so:

“[Dr. Rosov] provides no support in the record for his allegation that the

investigation was substantially defective. He presented no evidence that Bartrem’s

manner of investigation was faulty, nor does the record support such a conclusion.

Rosov rests his argument on the fact of Bartrem’s employment by the Board and

interaction with the staff during the investigation. Lf that were that the standard,

any such report, by any agency charged with the enforcement of professional

standards, would be suspect.”

Id, at 115-16.

Here, Ms. Noppinger was present and testified about her findings. She related Patient 7’s
testimony in lieu of Patient 7 testifying because, presumably, Patient 7 was incarcerated and
unavailable to appear at the hearing. Yet, as the Rosov court emphasized, hearsay is admissible in
administrative hearings. Id, at 116. Additionally, just as in Rosov, Ms. Noppinger prepared
interim investigative reports summarizing her notes; she did not offer conclusions about whether
she believed that the Respondent engaged in acts of misconduct, (Resp. Ex. 16.) For the most
part, when she testified, Ms. Noppinger also related only what interviewees told her. She also
: jdentified (i.e., authenticated) the transcripts of the patient-interviews that she and her co-
investigators conducted, which the State offered as evidence. Therefore, the Respondent argues
that Ms. Noppinger’s investigative reports were deficient for essentially the same reasons that
Dr. Rosov alleged that’ Ms. Bartrem’s investigative report was deficient in his case, and the Court
of Special Appeals rejected Dr. Rosov’s arguments.

As I discuss in detail below, there admittedly were discrepancies between what many of
the patients told Ms. Noppinger and what they testified to at the hearing. These kinds of
discrepancies are to be expected given that some of the earliest instances of the Respondent’s

misconduct took place in late 2012. Memories can become clouded and details lost with that

clouding. The Respondent, as noted, complained about this time lag (lack of contemporaneous

47
corroboration), but that too was unavoidable under the circumstances of this proceeding. Most of
the patients here were reluctant to complain about the Respondent’s inappropriate touching,
because they were unsure whether the Respondent ‘was just performing a thorough.examination
or whether he had crossed the line into sexual impropriety. Despite the time lags present here, I

’ found the patients’ versions of what occurred essentially identical at the macro level.
Discrepancies only appear at the micro level.-Again, I will examine in detail how these micro
variances did or did not affect each patient’s credibility.

The Respondent has protested throughout all phases of this proceeding that he was unable

to seek potentially exculpatory materials from his former copoye dealt with
the subpoena that the Respondent sent i. various patient interview records

in my November 14, 2016 Order and on the first day of hearing. I will not revisit that ruling here.
" Suffice it to state, that in the instances of six out of seven patients, the Respondent had the
opportunity to confront his accusers face-to-face. His attomeys engaged in rigorous cross-
examination of those six patients. His attorneys had the opportunity to question Ms. Noppinger
about Patient 7’s interview. His attorneys also had the opportunity to object to the State’s
evidence. Additionally, I am not making my proposed decision based ‘i
investigation; lam making it solely on the record before me.

The Respondent further asserts that the failure of Ms. Noppinger to inform the Board of
discrepancies and inconsistencies between the statements of the complaining patients in the
medical record and other objective facts, which he contends, might have avoided bringing of
some or all the charges in the first place, was also a deficiency in the Board’s investigation. The
Respondent cited no legal authority that requires the investigator to inform the Board of any
discrepancies and inconsistencies. As noted above, section 14-405(g) of the Act forecloses

attacks on the investigative process.
In a similar vein, the Respondent argues that the failure of Ms. Noppinger to notify him
when it altered the allegations of the patients to correspond to what she determined would be the
correct dates or circumstances (based on medical records or other documents) was a deficiency
that denied him due process. Again, the Respondent cited no legal authority establishing such a
requirement, and, likewise, section 14-405(g) of the Act precludes an attack on the investigative
process.

According to the Respondent, the Board also violated his due process rights by failing to
obtain peer review information about how lower back examinations should be done. To the
extent that peer review was necessary, the State’s failure to pursue it would only inure to the
benefit of the Respondent.”” L agree with the State, however, that peer review was unnecessary
here because this hearing did not involve standard of care issues. Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(22)
(Supp. 2016); COMAR 10.32.02.03D(1)(a). The charges at issue concern inappropriate sexual
touching by the Respondent, not whether the Respondent performed a proper lower back
examination of the patients who accused him of sexual misconduct.

The Respondent further argues that the Administrative Prosecutor’s amendment of the
charges “on-the-fly” is not a call that an administrative prosecutor can make. Amendment
authotity is vested in the Board. The Respondent views any amendment of the charges as making
him face a “moving target,” which rendered him incapable of offering a cogent defense.

I disagree with the Respondent’ s assertions regarding the amendment of the Amended
Charges. The Amended Charges were not altered in any significant way such that the
Respondent could not defend against them. For example, Charge 13 was altered to eliminate the
sentence, “The Respondent then reached around and came close to, but did not touch Patient 1’s

vagina.” That is a charge that the State admitted that it could not prove. I cannot find prejudice to

 

2) The Respondent could have offered his own peer review evidence in the form of an expert opinion, provided that
he complied with the requirements of COMAR 10,32.02,04C(3)(a).

49
As discussed below, however, the Panel does not find a violation with respect to Patient 7,
therefore the admissibility of the transcript of Patient 7’s interview is of no consequence to Dr.
Williams. Dr. Williams’s exception on this issue is denied.

IV. Amending of Charges (Exception 5)

During the hearing, the State sought to modify several statements in the amended charges
to accurately reflect the testimony of the witnesses who had previously testified at the hearing.
Dr. Williams objected and argued that the amending of the charges in the middle of the hearing
precluded him from later arguing that the charges were not supported by the testimony from the
witness stand and deprived him of adequate notice. The ALJ permitted the modifications and
found, “[t]he amended charges were not altered in any significant way such that [Dr. Williams]
could not defend against them.” As a result, the ALJ also found that the amended charges, with
or without the State’s modifications, provided Dr. Williams with sufficient notice of the charges
against him. In his exceptions, Dr. Williams argues that the ALJ erred by permitting the State to
amend the factual allegations in the charges, claiming that it deprived him of the notice required
for due process.

The Panel has reviewed the modifications made to the amended charges. All the
modifications made during the hearing pertain to Patient 1. In light of the fact that the Panel did
not find a violation as to Patient 1, the modifications made to the amended charges have no
impact on the Panel’s final decision and order in this case. As such, the modifications to the
amended charges are irrelevant and the Panel need not address whether Dr. Williams was

provided sufficient notice to comport with due process. Dr. Williams’s exception is denied.
the Respondent by the removal of a charge. In another example, a sentence in Charge 18 was
amended to change the words, “After the procedure,” to “Before the procedure,” and “post-
surgical” to “pre-surgical.” Again, with the remainder of Charge 18 intact, I cannot find any
prejudice to the Respondent; he still had sufficient information to defend against the charge. In

_ addition, it would be a tremendous waste of time for the Administrative Prosecutor to receive
pennission from the Board every time she wanted to make minor alterations in the charges, when
they did not impair the fundamental aspects of the charges as a whole.

Furthermore, Footnote 3 of the Amended Charges, states the following:

The statements of the Respondent’s conduct with respect to the patients

identified herein are intended to provide the Respondent with notice of the alleged

charges. They are not intended as, and do not necessarily represent a complete

description of the evidence, either documentary or testimonial to be offered

against the Respondent.

(State’s Ex. 51 at 4.)

With this disclaimer, the Board is alerting the Respondent that it does not intend to prove
each charge against him verbatim. Its charges serve as a guide to alert the Respondent about the
nature of his alleged misconduct. As the State notes, the charging document only needs to
provide the Respondent with the “gist of the charges.” Regan v. State Bd. of Chiropractic
Exam'rs, 355 Mad. 397, 417-18 (1999). The Amended Charges document, with or without
alterations, certainly does that. Similarly, the Court of Special Appeals, citing Mullane v. Central
Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950), noted, “Due process requires ‘notice
reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency
of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.’” Reese v, Dep't of
Health & Mental Hygiene, 177 Md. App. 102, 150 (2007). The Amended Charges document

fulfills this requirement as well.
Il. Charges Under Section 14-404(a)(3)(i) and (ii) of the Act.
A. The Respondent.
The Respondent was initially licensed to practice medicine in Maryland on October 18,
2007, after receiving his medical education in Michigan and Iinois and practicing medicine in
Illinois before moving to Maryland in 2007. He is forty-three years old. The Respondent is

board-certified in anesthesiology and the sub-specialty of pain medicine. From November 2010

through October 2014, | the Respondent as an interventional pain

management specialist. While at | saw patients in Maryland at a:
ee Office Buildings. As noted above,
l= him from his employment in late October 2014. fF |

ie the Respondent as a pain management physician in December 2014. He

 
  

 

remained an actively practicing physician there until May 2016, when the Board summarily ©
suspended his medical license.

Many of the patients the Respondent treated initially had favorable opinions of him,
including some who testified against him. Patients 1 and 6, for example, emphasized that before
they learned about the Respondent, they could not find another pain management physician who
would anesthetize them before administering excruciatingly painful TFESIs and LIF injections.
They had, in fact, avoided those kinds of injections for some time before becoming the
Respondent’s patients, despite the potential those injections had for relieving their back pain.

On June 24, 2013, Patient 6 was so satisfied with the care that the Respondent provided

to her that she sent an e-mail message TE sins him. That complimentary e-

mail stated the following:
Wow! What can I not say about a terrific doctor, what I would like to say

is that I truly, truly, truly appreciate [the Respondent]. All the pain issues I’ve

been going through all these years[—Jhe’s been so attentive to understand what

I’ve been going through. He’s always prompt fo respond in a timely fashion

through kp.org or phone calls. Due to my pain situation, he has always fit me into

his schedule to take care of my condition. J hope he never, never leaves. I want to

thank him from the bottom of my heart for the person he is.

(Test. Patient 6, T.at 497; State’s Ex, 33 at 00035.)

Nevertheless, the evidence offered by the State depicts a very different Respondent—
not the caring physician that Patient 6 portrayed in her June 24, 2013 e-mail—but a sexual
predator who engaged in a pattem of subtly groping his female patients, including Patient 6,
while ostensibly examining them for back pain.”®

The Respondent engaged in a distinct pattern of abuse that can be readily discerned,
beginning with Patient 1. Elements of that pattern can be seen in how he interacted with her, as
well as the remaining six patients who are the subject of the Board’s charges.

B. Patient 1. |

Patient 1 began seeing the Respondent precisely because the Respondent used twilight
sedation to administer otherwise painful spinal injections. Patient 1 testified that the Respondent
first examined her on November 21, 2012, ee Office Building. That
examination took place in a cubicle surrounded by privacy curtains that could be rolled in and
out of place.

According to Patient 1, during that November 21, 2012 examination, once the
Respondent manipulated her legs, he had her pull down her pants and underwear past her
buttocks. The Respondent then took his bare hands (i.e., hé was not wearing gloves) and
examined Patient 1’s lower waist and buttocks. Patient 1 noted that the Respondent started at her
hips and moved his hands up and down until he reached her buttocks. Once there, the

?8 Or, as the State characterized it, “[TJhe Respondent inappropriately touched seven female patients in sexualized
areas of their body, their vagina, buttocks and anus without medical necessity, without patient consent and under the
guise of medical treatment.” (T. at 1404.)

52
- Respondent spread and, opened Patient l’s buttocks cheeks, placing his fingers inside her gluteal
cleft as he did so.”

Patient 1 stated that she thought it was odd that the Respondent needed to examine her
buttocks at all, let alone in the manner that he did. She asserted, “When I left, I had the notion in
my head my doctor‘is nasty. He examined me with no gloves. But I did not view it as being
anything wrong. | just viewed it as part of his examination and he was just careless.” (Test.

Patient 1, T. at 198.)

 
 
 

then and has nowa chaperone policy. , RT
testified that chaperone policy allowed all patients (as well as parents and
guardians) to request a nonfamily member chaperone to be present during an examination or
procedure, including, but not limited to: (1) any pelvic examination and (2) any genital, breast
and/or anal examination. Signs announcing this policy are posted in all i: examination
rooms, Patient 1 reported, however, that no chaperone was present during the November 21,
2012 examination, or during any subsequent examinations of her that the Respondent performed. .
She, like the other patients mentioned here, found no need for a chaperone because the
Respondent was examining her for issues related to spinal pain; she did not anticipate him
examining her buttocks.

_ On December 14, 2012, the Respondent administered two injections to Patient 1, a TFESI

and an LEI. Patient 1 had an appointment with the Respondent on January 26, 2013, as a follow-

up to receiving her injections. Patient 1 averred that these appointments took place without

incident.

——

2° On July 8, 2015, Patient 1 told Ms. Noppinger that the Respondent “felt inside her behind.” (State’s Ex. 8 at 5.)
On November 14, 2016, she testified that he “felt inside my buttock.” (T. at 201.) Based on Patient 1’s two parallel
accounts of what occurred and Patient 1’s assertion that the Respondent did not penetrate ber anus, 1 determined that
on November 21, 2012, the Respondent used Patient 1s gluteal cleft or buttocks crack as the gripping point for his
fingers when he spread Patient 1’s buttocks’ cheeks.

53
 

On June 14, 2013, in preparation for having another TFESI and LFJ injection series, the
Respondent performed a preoperative examination of Patient 1 ae...
Patient 1 testified that that examination similarly took place in a cubicle surrounded by privacy
curtains. The cubicle was located near the ASC where the Respondent would be administering
the injections to Patient 1’s spine. Before he examined Patient 1, to facilitate the injection
process, Patient 1 noted that the Respondent had her remove her street clothes and put ona
hospital gown.

Patient 1 explained that when the Respondent examined her on June 14, 2013, he had her
stand while he sat on a stool. He was facing her back. Patient 1 stated that the Respondent moved
his hands from the bottom of her legs upward to her thighs. He then moved up to Patient 1’s
buttocks region, where he placed his hands to the front of Patient 1’s body toward her vagina,
coming close to the vaginal opening. Although her hearing testimony and her interview remarks
to Board Investigator Doreen Noppinger varied slightly, it is certain that Patient 1 exclaimed
something close to “Man, what are you doing?” when the Respondent’s hands approached
Patient l’s vagina. According to Patient 1, the Respondent reacted to Patient 1°s exclamation by
saying, “It’s all right. Don’t worry. It’s all right.” Patient 1 was sedated soon afterward to receive
her injections.

Patient 1 had other visits with the Respondent after June 14, 2013 that were uneventful.
On January 24, 2014, Patient 1, though, appeared at the ascinf. teceive a steroid
inj ection/cooled radiofrequency ablation of lateral branch. She invited her boyfriend, Person 1, to
remain in the room with her while the Respondent examined her. She testified that she wanted’
Person | there because she feared the Respondent might again touch her in inappropriate places.
Patient 1 had, at this point, told Person 1 about ‘what she believed were the Respondent’s

questionable examination techniques.
According to Patient 1, on January 24, 2014, the Respondent had her disrobe and put on a
hospital gown. The Respondent then examined Patient 1 in a cubicle similar to the one that he
examined her in on June 14, 2013. There was a bed and a chair inside the cubicle, and, just as on
November 21, 2012 and June 14, 2013, the cubicle was surrounded by two movable curtains.

Patient 1 explained that the Respondent began his examination by having her stand with
her arms spread out in front of her. He sat on a movable stool and, with gloved hands, he started
palpating at the base of Patient 1’s legs and continued to move his hands up her body until they
reached underneath her hospital gown. Patient 1 asserted that he kept moving up her legs until
his hands touched her vagina. Once there, Patient 1 described the Respondent putting his fingers
inside her vagina, and while doing so, she maintained that his knuckles touched her clitoris.

According to Patient 1, when she felt the Respondent’s fingers inside her vagina, she
became distressed. She asked the Respondent “Why are you doing this? You already determined
there’s nothing there triggering any pain. So, why you keep doing this?” Patient 1 insisted that
the Respondent did not respond to anything she said. He ignored her and continued to feel
around her vagina.

After completing his examination, Patient 1 and Person 1, who,.as noted, was in the
examination room the entire time that the Respondent was examining Patient 1, both saw the
Respondent take off his gloves, sniff them, roll them up, and discard them in the trash. They also
noted that when he exited to the hallway, he threw his arms in the air as he walked away from
the examination cubicle.

I find Patient 1’s testimony credible. Patient 1’s description of the Respondent’s conduct
was detailed, and it has remained consistent in all important respects for a long time. | agree with
the Respondent that Patient 1’s hearing testimony varied somewhat from what she told Board

Investigator Doreen Noppinger on July 8, 2015.1 will also acknowledge that Patient 1 had some

55
 

difficulty in recalling when certain events happened and where they happened. She confused
some of the events that occurred in June 2013 with those that occurred in January 2014. She also
misidentified the place where her January 2014 examination and injection procedure took place

=

The variations in what Patient 1 remembered actually bolster Patient 1’s trustworthiness.

    

If Patient 1 had concocted a tale of alleged sexual abuse by the Respondent, evidence of
rehearsal would have been readily apparent. One would have expected identical tellings each
time someone asked her to explain what happened. The variances that I described, therefore,
suggest Patient 1 did not rehearse her testimony and relied solely on her memory to relate the
Respondent’s misconduct.

‘Patient 1 also became emotional while describing what the Respondent did to her. She
developed shortness of breath when she began testifying about the events of January 24, 2014.
(T. at 209.) She started crying when speaking about how the Respondent would not stop ,
touching her vagina on that date despite her protests.>° Id.

Person 1 was present during the January 24, 2014 in the cubicle during Patient 1’s
examination. To the extent that he could see what the Respondent was doing, he supported
Patient 1°s version of events. I realize that Person 1 is Patient 1°s significant other, so he cannot
be deemed an impartial witness. Yet, he exhibited a matter-of-fact demeanor when he testified.

Therefore, I found him credible as well.

°° Y noticed that while Patient 1 was offering this emotionally-charged testimony, the Respondent was sitting at the
hearing room table with his attorneys, unfazed, with his head down taking notes. Just a few minutes later, he raised
his head and began staring at Patient 1 while she testified. When she noticed the Respondent staring at her, Patient 1
remarked, “He keep (sic) looking over here at me. It makes me very uncomfortable and he now (sic) it. He know
(sic) what he did.” (Test. Patient 1, T. at 212.) I interpret the Respondent's act of staring at Patient | while she was
testifying to be an intimidation tactic, particularly since he also stared at Patient 2, and she called him on it as well.
(Test. Patient 2, T. at 399.) These two acts of intimidation by the Respondent undermine his credibility.

56
The Respondent denied sexually abusing Patient 1 or touching her jnappropriately in any
way. He, in fact, made a blanket denial of abusing and/or inappropriately touching all seven of
the patients who have accused him of wrongdoing. To amplify his blanket denial, he called Dr.
Neil Howard Blumberg, whom | accepted as an expert in forensic psychiatry. The Respondent
asked Dr. Blumberg to provide an opinion concerning whether he had the mental make-up of a
sexual predator. Dr. Blumberg testified that he conducted two mental status examinations of the
Respondent—the latest one done on October 24, 2016, within a month of the first day of the .
hearing. Based on those examinations, Dr. Blumberg expressed the opinion that the Respondent
does not have the mental make-up to be a sexual predator. (Test. Blumberg, T. at 863-66.) Dr.
Blumberg noted that has been a practicing forensic psychiatrist for thirty-five years. During four
of those years (from 2009 through 2013), he was Chief of Forensic Services at Spring Grove
Hospital Center, a State-run inpatient psychiatric facility. Dr. Blumberg noted that he has seen’
many individuals who have been diagnosed as psychopathic sex offenders. In his view, the
Respondent possesses none of the proclivities of a psychopathic sex offender. (T. at 866.)
According to Dr. Blumberg, the Respondent does not have an elevated or grandiose mood state.
He is neither impulsive nor hypersexual. The Respondent is not narcissistic, antisocial or
manipulative. In short, Dr. Blumberg stated because the Respondent has none of the character
traits one would expect to find ina psychopathic sex offender, chances are that the Respondent is
not one. (Id.)

I have considered Dr. Blumberg’s expert testimony, but do not find it compelling. It lacks
persuasivences because it does not address the situations that form the basis for the Board’s
charges. The Respondent is not charged with rape or any other criminal offense. Dr. Blumberg’s
assessment might be accurate insofar as it shows that the Respondent would be incapable of

committing rape or aggravated sexual assault outside of the doctor-patient relationship. As

57
 

Patient 1’s description of how the Respondent touched her in sexualized areas demonstrates,
though, his sexual misconduct is not overt, but subtle. In reviewing the descriptions of how the
Respondent sexually touched each of the seven patients, I found a distinct pattern. The
Respondent always started his examination by squeezing or manipulating a non-sexualized part
of Patient 1*s body, her back or legs, for example. He would then work his way either up or
down to a sexualized area, such as the buttocks or vagina. His modus operandi was so discreet
that after her first examination by the Respondent, Patient 1 actually questioned herself about

whether the Respondent had crossed any boundaries, even though she felt his exam was

&,

nasty.”3!

The Respondent not only attempted to bolster his own credibility, but he went on to
attack Patient 1°s credibility (as well as all of the other patients who are the subject of this "
hearing). The Respondent focused on the many discrepancies in her testimony in an effort to
discredit her. As I already noted, I find no merit in this approach. I will, however, for the sake of
completeness, address his arguments in this regard.

The Respondent asserts that on November 21, 2012, contrary to what was in the Board’s
original charges, the Respondent did not come close to Patient 1’s vagina when he examined
Patient 1. During the hearing, as already discussed, the State had, to withdraw that part of its
original charge. The Respondent maintains that on November 21, 2012, he did a lumbosacral
spinal exam on Patient 1 to treat her symptoms of sacroiliac joint dysfunction. He did not
examine Patient 1°s buttocks in any way. In short, the Respondent contends that he performed a

proper examination of Patient 1’s lumbar spine that in no way involved any sexual misconduct,

3! The State suggests that taking Dr, Blumberg’s assessment to its logical conclusion, if a mental disorder did not
compel the Respondent to commit the acts of sexual misconduct with his female patients, then he must have done
them purely to seek his own sexual gratification. (T. at 1411-12.)

58
. For the reasons I already provided in detail, I found Patient 1°s testimony as a whole
credible. I believe the Respondent went beyond performing a lumbosacral spinal examination on
Patient 1 in November 21, 2012, when he ventured onto spreading her buttocks’ cheeks. He was
not wearing gloves. Under the definition of sexual impropriety contained. in COMAR
10.32.17.02B(2)(b)(ii), a physician commits an act of sexual impropriety with a patient when he
performs a pelvic or rectal examination without using gloves. Consequently, absent any other
evidence of sexual misconduct, the Respondent committed an act of sexual impropriety on
November 21, 2012, by simply performing an examination of Patient 1’s buttocks without
wearing gloves.

With regard to the June 14, 2013 incident, the Respondent attacks the “salacious
language” in Charge 15 referring to the Respondent separating Patient 1’s labia, moving his
hands up and down alongside Patient 1’s vagina walls, and having his knuckles touch Patient 1’s
clitoris. Patient 1 did not use any of these words when speaking to Ms. Noppinger, according to
the Respondent. In fact, she told Ms. Noppinger and repeated at the hearing, that the Respondent
only came close to her vagina that day. On cross-examination, Patient 1 asserted that she did use
the word “clitoris” when discussing the events of June 14, 2013 with Ms. Noppinger, but what
she said was probably not transcribed. The Respondent emphasized that Patient 1s interview
with Ms. Noppinger was transcribed by a court reporter, who is paid not to forget to transcribe
the words of an interviewee. .

Whether the Respondent actually touched Patient 1’s vaginal walls or clitoris on June 14,
2013 has no significance to the ultimate resolution of the charges here. The Respondent was
supposed to be performing an examination of Patient 1’s lower back. He was not supposed to be

anywhere near Patient 1’s vagina or buttocks.
Vv. Factual Discrepancies

Dr. Williams argues that the ALJ ignored certain facts and data that demonstrated that the
allegations of the seven patients were not credible. He contends that he performed appropriate
standard low back examinations on each of the seven patients, which were documented in the
medical records. The exceptions made with respect to Patient’s 2-7 will be discussed below.’
Patient 2

Patient 2 was seen by Dr. Williams on August 18, 2014, for pain in her spine. Dr.
Williams asked the patient to lie down on the examination table and palpated from the top of her
spine to the bottom, asking the patient if she was in any pain at various points during the
examination. Patient 2 indicated that she was not in pain except that it was a little uncomfortable
in her waist area. Dr. Williams continued to go lower and asked the patient to unbutton her jeans.
Dr. Williams grabbed her underwear and tried to pull them down. When he was not able to pull
them down, he instructed Patient 2 to pull down her underwear so that her entire buttocks were
exposed. Dr. Williams continued to palpate until he reached her anus. Dr. Williams put on a
glove and started touching her inside her anus. Dr. Williams did not use any lubricant and no
chaperone was present for the examination. Patient 2 pulled up her pants and sat on the
examination table while Dr. Williams was taking notes. Dr. Williams then asked Patient 2 to
unbutton her pants a second time and he helped her to pull her pants down and expose her entire
buttocks again. This time, Dr. Williams put on gloves and stuck a quarter of his finger into the
patient’s anus, again, without using lubricant or having a chaperone present. Dr. Williams did not
explain to the patient on either occasion why it was necessary for him to insert his finger into her

anus.

7 As discussed above, the Panel did not find a violation as to Patient 1 due to procedural irregularities concerning the
motion to quash and, therefore, the Panel need not address any alleged factual discrepancies related to the testimony
of Patient 1.
Part of the problem I found was that Patient 1 confused what occurred on June 14, 2013
with what occurred on January 24, 2014. On the latter occasion, the Respondent touched Patient
1's vagina, and his knuckles grazed Patient 1’s clitoris. To reiterate, given that three incidents
occurring over fourteen months were involved here, one would expect Patient 1’s memory to
fade after two or three years. Yet, the essence of her account of what occurred remains intact.

. The Respondent also attempted to impeach Patient 1’s credibility by challenging her ,
memory about where (i.e., the specific ER: his examinations of her took place, the
way she related what took place to her primary care physician, the kind of procedure she

‘received and so on. I consider these attempts to discredit Patient 1 failures for the reasons already
set forth.

- Despite my finding Patient 1’s testimony credible as a whole, I do not find sufficient
credible evidence to support the Board’s allegation in Charge 22 that the Respondent had an
erection while he was examining Patient 1 on January 24, 2014. The Respondent indicated that
he was wearing loose-fitting extra-large scrubs on that day that would have obscured any
erection, even if he had one. The State suggests that the obscuring effect of the scrubs would be
eliminated once the Respondent sat down, and Patient 1 indicated that on the date in question the
Respondent was sitting down when he examined her. There are reasons that Patient 1 might have
seen a bulge or ripple in the Respondent’s scrubs on January 24, 2014, other than the Respondent
having an erection. Therefore, without more support in the record, I find the evidence
inconclusive that the Respondent had an erection on that date.

With regard to Patient 1, I conclude that the Respondent committed a sexual impropriety
as defined by COMAR 10.32.17.02B(2)(b)Gi) when he spread the cheeks of Patient 1°s buttocks
on November 21, 2012 without using gloves. I further conclude that he committed a sexual .

violation as defined by COMAR 10.32.17.02B(4)(v) when he spread the cheeks of Patient 1’s

60
buttocks without medical necessity on November 21, 2012, touched her buttocks and area
surrounding her vagina without medical necessity on June 14, 2013 and placed his fingers inside
Patient 1’s vagina and brashed his knuckles over her clitoris without medical necessity on
January 24, 2014. These acts, by falling within the purview of sexual misconduct by a physician,
as defined by COMAR 10.32.17.02B(3)(a) and (b), in turn, constitute immoral and
unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, subjecting the Respondent to disciplinary
action against his medical license under section 14-404(a)(3)(i) and (ii) of the Act.
C. Patient 2.
The Respondent’s misconduct, as it related to his putting his fingers inside Patient 1’s
vagina, prompted Patient 1 to notify her primary care physician, Dr. me in turn,

reported what Patient 1 told him to the Respondent’s superiors. Dr. P| the

Respondent’s supervising physician, ultimately became involved and placed the Respondent on

  

approximately two weeks administrative leave while he had onduct an
investigation into Patient 1’s allegations. On or about February 13, 2014, Dr Rane
the Respondent, told him nal found Patient 1’s charges unsubstantiated,
but he also directed the Respondent to (1) always use non-family member chaperones for all
female patients and all patients, male or female, where breasts, buttocks or genitals might
become involved and (2) attend an online seminar called, “Understanding Boundary Violations
and Chaperone Use-Best Practices. 3 |

The Respondent believes that because Dr BP owes him to return fo work, he
had been exonerated of engaging in sexualized conduct with regard to Patient 1. (He

remembered De: him, “That lady’s crazy. I don’t know what she’s talking

about.” Test. Resp., T. at 1242.) Yet, | find it telling that Dr RF ome a stricter version

>? The Respondent has a different recollection of his telephone conversation with Dr. a which 1 will discuss

in more detail below, as that conversation is more relevant to my discussion of the Board’s charges under section
14-404(a)(11) and (36) of the Act.

ii: chaperone policy on the Respondent than was applicable to other

physicians who were practicing under his supervision. I infer that DR that the

Respondent’s examination methods were such that patients might have falsely believed they
were of a sexnal nature, when in fact they were not, When he testified, D1 Roane:
that he imposed the strict chaperone policy on the Respondent because he wanted to make sure
that when the Respondent performed “below-the-belt” physical examinations of female patients
(those that might involve the buttocks, vagina, or rectum) those patients would not erroneously
conclude that the Respondent’s examination was sexual in nature..(Test. a T. at 547.)
Nevertheless, when the Respondent examined Patient 2, six months later on August 24, 2014, he
did not use a chaperone.

Patient 2 visited the Respondent ie on August 18, 2014 for

treatment of spine-related pain. Her primary care physician, Dr. | eta the

- Respondent, because he knew he had been successful in treating patients with chronic back pain.

Patient 2 testified that after she had series of x-rays, a nurse escorted her into a small

examination room, which allowed its door to be closed for patient privacy. Patient 2 was fully
clothed, wearing blue jeans and a white shirt. She did not have to dress in a hospital gown. After
Patient 2 explained the kinds of back problems she was having, the Respondent examined her. |
First, he had her perform the leg exercises on the examination table. Then he had her stand up
facing toward the door. He was behind Patient 2. It is unclear at this point whether he was
wearing gloves. He then palpated Patient 2’s spine from her neck to her abdomen. He pressed
down at various places on Patient 2’s spine, asking her if it hurt at each pressure point. She only

described pain when the Respondent started pressing in her waist area.
According to Patient 2, when the Respondent had reached her buttocks, he asked her to
unbutton her blue jeans, so he could further palpate down her spine. At this point, she stated he
grabbed her panties and tried to pull them down. When he could not get them down, he directed
Patient 2 to do pull them down to the point that she was exposing her entire buttocks. The
Respondent continued to palpate until he reached Patient 2’s anus. Patient 2 testified that
although the Respondent was gentle when he first touched her anus, she felt uncomfortable.

After examining a region around Patient 2’s anus, the Respondent reached for some
gloves that were sitting on the sink in the room, put them on, and began touching inside of
Patient 2’s rectum. Patient 2 reported that he'did so without using any cream or lubricant. Patient
2 testified that she continued to feel uncomfortable, that is, uncomfortable because she felt
violated and embarrassed by what the Respondent was doing.

After a nurse interrupted the Respondent’s examination of Patient 2 by alerting him
through the closed door that another doctor wanted to see him, Patient 2 stated that the
Respondent directed her to stand up again. Patient 2 reported that the Respondent positioned her
sideways and positioned his legs between her legs. He asked Patient 2 to unbutton her jeans one
more time, because he “wanted to make sure of something.”

Patient 2 testified that the Respondent once again had her pull her jeans and panties down
to the point where her buttocks were fully exposed. She stated he put new gloves on, and faced
her, placing about one quarter of a finger inside her anus, and he asked Patient 2 whether it hurt.
According to Patient 2, she said, “Not really.” Patient 2 was clear that the Respondent never
explained to her why he needed to examine her anus.

Patient 2 noted that although she never saw the Respondent again, she attempted to
contact him by e-mail, because she was still seeking his guidance regarding treatment of her back

pain. On one occasion, he responded, but did not answer her questions. Other times, he did not

63
 

respond at all. In mid-October 2014, when she became frustrated about not receiving e-mail
responses to her questions from the Respondent and others at | 2 wrote
an e-mail to her primary care physician, Dr. Be: the complaints that she made in her
e-mail to Dr. as that the Respondent sexually abused her. This communication
culminated in an investigation by i i Human
Resources Department. :

Patient 2 testified that after the Respondent essentially violated her sexually by

examining her anus for no medically-valid reason on August 18, 2014, she began ‘having

- difficulty sleeping, She has been having unpleasant dreams about the Respondent touching her in
her anus. She woke up screaming, having what she first perceived as convulsions. A neurologist
diagnosed her with having night terrors. She also reports that she developed a body rash that she
did not have’ before her encounter with the Respondent. Patient 2 noted that she had been

sexually abused when she was a child growing up in Costa Rica. Patient 2 indicated that the
August 18, 2014 incident involving the Respondent brought back bad memories of that prior
incident of sexual abuse, (Test. Patient 2, T. at 355-57.)

The Respondent suggests that Patient 2 had ulterior motives for accusing him of sexually
abusing her on August 18, 2014. He notes that Patient 2 admitted on cross-examination that she
is pursuing a disability claim. (Test. Patient 2, T. at 360.) Although Patient 2 indicated that she is .
seeking eligibility for disability payments based on cervical spondylosis, she has been seeing a
psychiatrist for three yeats. (Test. Patient 2, T. at 361.) Additionally, the Respondent points out
that Patient 2 only started accusing him of sexual abuse when her e-mail requests SC
medical providers for answers to her questions went unanswered. It was only at this point, when

her expectations were unmet, that Patient 2 “lashed out.” (T. at 1442.)
‘According to the Respondent, Patient 2 also should not be believed because her testimony
is uncorroborated. Patient 2 testified that she told her husband about how the Respondent
‘touched her in her around her anus immediately after the event occurred on the evening of |

August 18, 2014. Yet, Ms. Noppinger never interviewed Patient 2’s husband on behalf of the

Board, nor did the State call Patient 2’s husband to testify. When | iii
interviewed Patient 2 over the telephone in October 2014, eh

Compliance Officer for the|

 

 

articipated in that interview. Again,

- Ms. Noppinger never interviewed Ms. i: did the State call

- to testify. The Respondent noted that Ms.

    

erved as a scribe; Patient 2’s native
language is Spanish, and she used the word “anals,” not anus. He asserted that he only went as
far as the very top of Patient 2’s gluteal cleft when he examined her, which in anatomical terms,
is far from the anus, “given [Patient 2’s] body habitus."

I find the Respondent’s attacks on Patient 2’s credibility are meritless. As noted earlier,
when Patient 2 testified, she did so emotionally, exhibiting considerable distress, She did not
wish to be at an administrative hearing testifying against the Respondent. At the end of her
testimony, she repeated twice, “I just want this over.” (Test Patient 2, T. at 356,) Accordingly, I
conclude that Patient 2 is not someone who would subject herself to the ordeal of testifying at a
hearing simply to enhance a disability claim, which is primarily based on a physical, rather than
a mental health-related issue. The lack of corroboration by Patient 2’s husband and Ms.

| Patient 2’s testimony has no significance. Patient 2’s testimony is corroborated
by her medical records, which show that she visited the Respondent on August 18, 2014, and by

her October 15, 2014 e-mail to oii in which she complained about the Respondent

sexually abusing her, almost as an afterthought. Patient 2’s focus at the time she wrote that e-

3 Patient 2 has a wide girth.
 

mail was her effort to obtain medical records from i: support her disability

claim, not to make a complaint against the Respondent. Furthermore, Patient 2 did not impress
me as an individual who would be so calculating that she would falsely accuse a physician,
endangering his livelihood for no valid-reason, simply to enhance a disability claim. When
Patient 2 testified on November 15, 2016 and started crying when reliving what the Respondent
had done to her on August 18, 2014, I found her tears genuine.

With regard to Patient 2, I conclude that the Respondent committed a sexual violation, as
defined by COMAR 10.32.17.02B(4)(v), by putting his finger’a quarter of the way inside her
anus on August 1 8, 2014, without medical necessity. This act, by falling within the purview of
sexual misconduct by a physician, as defined by COMAR 10.32.17.02(B)(3)(b), in turn,
constitutes immoral and unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, subjecting the
Respondent to disciplinary action against his medical license under section 14-404(a)(3)(i) and
Gi) of the Act.

D. Patient 3.

Patient 3 suffers from an Arnold-Chiria Type 2 malformation of the skull and the
degeneration of her cervical discs, These conditions have caused Patient 3 to have pain so severe
that she had an intrathecal pump implanted in the skin in her abdomen to supply a twenty-four
hour a day regimen of pain medication through a catheter inserted into her spine. Despite having
this pump, Patient 3 still needed to seek treatment for back pain. She also needed to have a
physician provide refills of her medication for her intrathecal pump.

Before becoming the Respondent’s patient, Patient 3 received pain management

treatment ‘ie: ie: though, Patient 3 had to seek
treatment from | ied once re a staff member that could provide the same

treatment that Patient 3 was obtaining from an outside medical provider. In June 2011, Patient 3

66
began seeing the Respondent for pain management services, because he could now provide those
services in-house. .
Patient 3 testified that from June 2011 through December 2013, the Respondent provided
pain management services to her without incident. That changed on December 16, 2013. On that
_ date, Patient 3 testified, the Respondent saw her in a small examination room FL
ae After making some adjustments with respect to her intrathecal pump, the
. Respondent performed an examination of Patient 3’s spine, because Patient 3 had indicated to
the Respondent that her pain was increasing and that she was feeling some numbness in her feet.
According to Patient 3, the Respondent directed her to get off the table where she was
sitting and stand up. She was dressed in street clothes, and the Respondent directed her to lower
. her pants below her buttocks. After she did so, he began pressing up and down her spine, toward
the bones that protrude from each side of the spinal column, At this point, Patient 3’s underwear
was below her buttocks’ cheeks.

After examining Patient 3’s pelvic region, the Respondent began examining Patient 3
between her legs. He started pushing up between her legs on both sides and up in between her
legs. He continued going up Patient 3’s legs until he reached her vagina. When she testified,
Patient 3 noted that the Respondent did not say anything about what he was doing or why he was
doing it when he got to her vagina. Once at Patient 3’s vagina, he pressed twice on one side of it
and then twice on the other side of it. Patient 3 was disturbed by what the Respondent had done.
She testified that she told him, “I do not like where you're at.” Despite Patient 3’s protests, the

Respondent continued pressing in and around Patient 3’s vaginal region.
Dr. Williams takes exception to the ALJ’s finding that he committed a sexual violation
against Patient 2 by putting his finger a quarter of the way inside her anus on August 18, 2014.
Dr. Williams testified that he performed an exam on the sacroiliac joint and the coccyx and, in
doing so, palpated at the very top of the gluteal cleft, but was adamant that he did not insert his
finger into Patient 2’s anus. Dr. Williams argues that there is no way he could have stuck a finger
in her anus without her bending over given her large size. The ALJ found Dr. Williams’s attacks
on Patient 2’s credibility to be “meritless.” The ALJ noted that Patient 2 was emotional when
testifying and exhibited “considerable distress.” It was clear to the ALJ that Patient 2 did not
wish to be at an administrative hearing testifying against Dr. Williams and the ALJ found that
the tears Patient 2 shed while testifying were genuine. The Panel adopts the ALJ’s credibility
determinations regarding Patient 2. The record reflects that there was no documented medical
reason for Dr. Williams to place his finger inside Patient 2’s anus.

The Panel finds that Dr. Williams committed a sexual violation as to Patient 2 and,
therefore, is guilty of immoral and unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in
violation of Health Occ. §14-404(a)(3). Dr. Williams’s exceptions with respect to Patient 2 are
denied.

Patient 3

Patient 3 has two medical conditions, Amold-Chiria Type 2 malformation and
degenerated cervical discs, which cause her to experience constant and severe back pain. The
patient’s pain is so severe that she requires an intrathecal pump implanted under the skin in her
abdomen to supply pain medication to her 24 hours per day. On December 16, 2013, Patient 3
saw Dr. Williams for a regular follow-up visit to obtain a refill of her intrathecal pump. During

that visit, Patient 3 informed Dr. Williams that she was in more pain than usual and that her pain
