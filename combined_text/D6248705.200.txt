d. At approximately 11:37 a.m., the Respondent left a voicemail for the Patient

24, On or about September 6, 2019, the Board notified the Respondent about the
complaint against him and the Board’s ongoing investigation. The Board requested that the
Respondent provided a written response and issued a subpoena to the Respondent for all records

from the Respondent on lined paper as well as five pages of handwritten notes on lined paper that

have not been able to successfully complete an outpatient therapy task with [the Patient] ‘Has been
a toothpick in my eye,’ since it happened. I knew how to do it... but I could not execute.” The

stressors and desire to “rebuild [his] integrity[.]”

supplemental written response in which he said that he, among other things, “categorically denies

to let [the Patient] check in with him once a week, until she found a therapist and medication
provider in the community .. .” (but see | 14d, supra.). The Respondent also expressed that he
“now believes that he was manipulated by [the Patient] into a compromising situation which he
did not sufficiently recognize at the time.” He admitted, however, that “by the fourth session, ina
mis-guided attempt to build trust, [the Respondent] did engage in what he acknowledges was
inappropriate contact with the patient. While they did not engage in sexual intercourse, they did
remove most of their clothes. As soon as [the Respondent] realized what he had been led into, he
ended the session and did not see the patient again, nor respond to her attempts to contact him”
