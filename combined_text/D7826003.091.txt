ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE
TO PRACTICE MEDICINE

Disciplinary Panel B (“Panel B”) of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the
) hereby SUMMARILY SUSPENDS the license of DUANE M. STELLIONS,
M.D. (the “Respondent”), license number D78260, to practice medicine in the State of
Maryland.

Panel B takes such action pursuant to its authority under Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t
§ 10-226(c)(2) (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2020 Supp.) concluding that the public health, safety or
welfare imperatively requires emergency action.

INVESTIGATIVE FINDINGS

Based on information received by, and made known to Panel B and the investigatory
information obtained by, received by and made known to and available to Panel B,
including the instances described below, Panel B has reason to believe that the following

i
facts are true:

' The statements regarding the Respondent’s conduct are intended to provide the Respondent with notice of
the basis of the suspension. They are not intended as, and do not necessarily represent a complete
description of the evidence, either documentary or testimonial, to be offered against the Respondent in
connection with this matter.
BACKGROUND

1. At all times relevant hereto, the Respondent was licensed to practice medicine in
the State of Maryland. The Respondent was initially licensed to practice medicine in
Maryland on July 24, 2014. His license is active and is scheduled to expire on September
30, 2021.

2. The Respondent is board-certified in anesthesiology and critical care medicine.
From 2014 until January 2021, the Respondent was employed by a health care facility
staffing company and primarily practiced as an intensivist at a health care facility located
in Montgomery County, Maryland (“Facility A”).

3. Prior to being licensed in the State of Maryland, the Respondent held a license in
the District of Columbia (D.C.), where the Respondent was employed at a healthcare
facility in the D.C. (the “D.C. Facility”).

4. In approximately May 2009, the Respondent was terminated from the D.C. Facility
after an investigation by the D.C. Facility that determined that the Respondent had misused
and diverted controlled dangerous substances (CDS) at the D.C. Facility. A report of the
investigation was later obtained by the District of Columbia Board of Medicine (“D.C.
Board”).

5. On or about August 18, 2009, the Respondent voluntarily surrendered his license to
practice medicine in D.C.

6. On or about November 16, 2009, (the “D.C. Board”) suspended the Respondent’s

license for at least two years based on the findings of the report of the D.C. Facility.
7. On or about August 22, 2012, the D.C. Board and the Respondent entered into a
Negotiated Settlement Agreement that reinstated the Respondent’s D.C. license. The
agreement required the Respondent to be supervised by a Board-approved anesthesiologist
and to enroll in the D.C. Physician Health Program.

COMPLAINT

8. On or about January 29, 2021, the Board received a Mandated 10-Day Report” (the
“Complaint”) stating that effective January 20, 2021, the Respondent’s clinical privileges
and medical staff membership at Facility A had been “summarily suspended” based on
eyewitness accounts and forensic evidence indicating that the Respondent had “diverted a
controlled substance.”

9. Based on the Complaint, the Board began an investigation.

INVESTIGATION

10. In furtherance of the investigation, the Board obtained a written response from the
~ Respondent to the Complaint, interviewed witnesses, and obtained the Respondent’s
personnel records from Facility A. The evidence obtained indicate that on multiple
occasions when the Respondent was working on the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU),
he diverted controlled dangerous substance (“CDS”) from patient IV medication pumps.
11. Included with the Respondent’s personnel records were statements to Facility A

from two eyewitnesses, both clinical nurses (“Clinical Nurse A” & “Clinical Nurse B”),

2 See Health Occ. § 14-413.
who directly observed the Respondent diverting a CDS by siphoning from patients’
intravenous medication pumps on multiple occasions.
12. Clinical Nurse A reported that on January 3, 2021, she saw the Respondent

acting weird around an IV pump. He appeared to be manipulating the pump
in some way. ... Later that day the same thing happened with the pump for
room 8...I could tell he was manipulating the pump in some way. ... This
Sunday, January 17, sometime after 4pm I saw him at the medication pump
for the patient un room 12 and he was pulling something from the IV. I
watched him remove the orange cap and withdrawal [sic] something from
the tube. He then took the filled syringe and put it in his pocket.

13. Clinical Nurse A further reported that the pump from which the Respondent

extracted the fluid contained CDS.

14. Clinical Nurse B reported nearly identical observations, specifically that on the
morning of January 16, 2021,

I was standing outside of room 10. From where I was standing, I saw Dr.
Stillions go to the outside of patient room 12 where the patient’s medication
pump was located. The patient in room 12 is a very sick, vented patient on
several drips. Dr. Stillions had a syringe in his hand. At first I thought he was
going to give the patient medication. He opened the orange cap and it fell to
the floor. I then watched Dr. Stillions attach the syringe to the secondary line
and withdrawal [sic] the patient’s medication. I notice that he filled up a 10
ce syringe with the medication and then put the syringe in his chest pocket.
He then took out a second syringe and did the same thing, filling it up with
close to 10 cc of the medication. ... The medication associated with this line
was [CDS].

15. Clinical Nurse B also reported that the following day, Sunday, January 17, 2021,
she observed the Respondent again diverting CDS using the same modus operandi:

When he came out [of the doctors’ lounge] he went directly to the supply
room first; after the supply room he went straight to the patient’s medication
pump outside room 12. I was outside room 11 at this time. I watched Dr.
Stillions withdrawal [sic] a full syringe of [CDS] from the tube. About this
time, the charge nurse asked me to fill Dr. Stillions in on the status of the

4
patient in room 11. As I spoke to him I noticed that he appeared very

hyperactive. After that when he left, I went back to the room 12 pump and I

saw again that the orange cap was missing from the [CDS] tube.
16. On or about February 12, 2021, the Board conducted an interview with Facility A
personnel under oath. Facility A personnel stated that after receiving the reports of the
Respondent’s conduct from Clinical Nurses A & B, Facility A conducted a forensic
examination of the medication pump outside room 12. Based on the examination, Facility
A concluded that “there was an amount of medication missing that we could not account
for.” The missing medication was the same CDS Clinical Nurses A & B observed the
Respondent divert.
17. Facility A personnel also stated in the interview with the Board that the patient in
room 12 was under the care of the Respondent when the Respondent was working on the
unit. The patient was an intubated COVID-19 patient. During the COVID-19 pandemic,
the IV medication pumps are located outside the patient rooms.
RESPONDENT’S WRITTEN RESPONSE
18. On or about February 18, 2021, the Board received a written response from the
Respondent regarding the Complaint. In his written response, the Respondent
acknowledged misusing CDS in the past and acknowledged that he “obtained” CDS from
Facility A. He cited as a reason for his diversion of CDS at Facility A the stress of working

as a physician during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Respondent also reported that
immediately after the suspension of his privileges at Facility A, he began a program that
includes rehabilitation treatment.
