After consideration of the parties’ presentations, Disciplinary Panel B determined, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the health, safety, and welfare of the public imperatively
required the disciplinary panel to summarily suspend Dr, Wiggins’s license and there exists a
substantial risk of serious harm to the public health, safety, and welfare in Dr. Wiggins’s
continued practice, Disciplinary Panel B thus will not lift the summary suspension order, and the
summary suspension imposed on February 14, 2022 is reaffirmed and continues in effect, See
COMAR 10,32.02.08H(1).

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, Dr Wiggins has the right to request a full evidentiary
hearing before an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Administrative Hearings. This
request will be granted if the Board receives a written request for the hearing within TEN (10)
days of the date of this letter. Any request for a hearing should be sent to Christine A. Farrelly,

Law Judge set the hearing to begin within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10,3202, O81;
though Dr. Wiggins may waive that 30-day requirement,

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel B eeauliing ems
