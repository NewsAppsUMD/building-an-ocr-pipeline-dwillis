Case No.: 2221-0090
License No.: L07049

Dear Ms. Rutherford and Counsel:

On March 31, 2021, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
RESPIRATORY CARE, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2), concerning
Ms. Rutherford’s license to practice respiratory care in Maryland.

On April 14, 2021, Disciplinary Panel A held the post-deprivation hearing by video-
conference. Ms. Rutherford appeared and was represented by Cory Silkman, Esq. The State was
represented by Robert Gilbert, Assistant Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor.

After consideration of the presentations of the parties, Disciplinary Panel A finds that the
public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires the summary suspension of Ms.
Rutherford’s license to practice respiratory care. See State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2)(i). The order of
summary suspension is, thus, reaffirmed, and Ms. Rutherford’s license to practice respiratory
care in Maryland remains summarily suspended. See COMAR 10.32.02.08H(1).
