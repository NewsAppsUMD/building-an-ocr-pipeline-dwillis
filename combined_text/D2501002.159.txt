Case No.: 2219-0085A.
License No.: D25010

Dear Dr. Nolan and Counsel:

On January 29, 2019, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl.
Vol.).

On February 13, 2019, Disciplinary Panel A held a postdeprivation hearing to show cause
why that suspension should not be continued. You and your counsel, Carolyn Jacobs, Esq,
attended the hearing on that date. The State was represented by Victoria H. Pepper, Assistant
Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor. Both parties presented oral arguments at the
hearing.

After considering these arguments at the hearing and the investigative file, Disciplinary
Panel A determined that it would continue the summary suspension imposed on January 29,
2019. Disciplinary Panel A thus will not lift the summary suspension order. Disciplinary Panel A
finds that the public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires the suspension of Dr. Nolan’s
license. See State Gov’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i). The order of summary suspension is thus reaffirmed

and continues. See COMAR 10.32. 02.08H(1). Disciplinary Panel A, through its counsel,
advised you, Ms. Jacobs, and the administrative prosecutor of this decision orally on the hearing
date.

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, Dr. Nolan has the right to request a full evidentiary hearing
before an Administrative Law Judge at the Office of Administrative Hearings. To receive the
evidentiary hearing, Dr. Nolan or her counsel must file the request for the hearing within TEN
(10) days of the date of this letter. The request for a hearing should be sent to Christine Farrelly,
Executive Director, at the Board’s address. If the hearing is timely requested, the regulations
require that an Administrative Law Judge set the hearing to begin within 30 days of the request,
see COMAR 10.32.02.08I, though that 30-day time period may be waived.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel A resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely yours,
aos
