Case No.: 7717-0017B
License No.: D44694

Dear Dr. Bailey and Counsel:

On July 17, 2017, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued
an ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE in
this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t II, § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl. Vol.). You
were given an opportunity to attend a postdeprivation hearing before Disciplinary Panel B to
show cause why that suspension should not be continued on July 26, 2017. You attended the
hearing on that date together with your counsel, Sigrid C. Haines, Esq. The State was represented
by Janet Brown, Assistant Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor. Both parties presented
oral arguments at the show cause hearing.

After considering these arguments at the hearing and the investigative file, Disciplinary
Panel B determined that it would continue the summary suspension imposed on July 17, 2017.
Disciplinary Panel B thus will not lift the summary suspension order. The arguments submitted,
when considered in the light of the investigative findings in the file, persuade Disciplinary Panel

B there exists a substantial risk of serious harm to the public health, safety or welfare in your
continued practice. Disciplinary Panel B, through its counsel, advised you of this decision orally
on the hearing date.

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, you have the right to request a full evidentiary hearing
before an Administrative Law Judge. This request will be granted if the Board receives a written
request for the hearing within TEN (10) days of the date of this letter. Any request for a hearing
should be sent to Christine Farrelly, Executive Director, at the Board’s address. If such a hearing
is requested, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set the hearing to begin
within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08 I, though that 30-day requirement may
be waived.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel B resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely yours,
