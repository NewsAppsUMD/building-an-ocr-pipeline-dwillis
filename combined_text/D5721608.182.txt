FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
PROCEDURAL HISTORY

Michael N. Baako, M.D., was originally licensed to practice medicine in the State of
Maryland on March 13, 2001, under license number D57216. On May 1, 2019, in the United
States District Court for the District of Maryland, Criminal Case Number 1:19-cr-00224-DKC-
1, Dr. Baako was charged with eight criminal counts, including passport fraud, false claim for
US. citizenship, and illegal voting by an alien. On July 31, 2019, Dr. Baako pleaded guilty to
Court Four of the Indictment, which charged Dr. Baako with passport fraud, in violation of 18
US.C. § 1542 (first paragraph). As part of the Plea Agreement, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for
the District of Maryland agreed to dismiss the remaining charges. On September 27, 2019, Dr.
Baako appeared before a U.S. District Judge and was sentenced for his guilty plea to Count
Four. Dr. Baako was sentenced to 15 months incarceration followed by three years of
supervised release and a special assessment of $100.

On June 17, 2022, the Office of the Attorney General filed with the Maryland ‘Board of
Physicians (the “Board”) a petition to revoke Dr. Baako’s license to practice medicine (“the
Petition”) and a proposed show cause order pursuant to section 14-404(b)(2) of the Maryland
Medical Practice Act. The statute provides:

qd) On the filing of certified docket entries with the Board by the Office of the
Attorney General, a disciplinary panel shall order the suspension of a
license if the licensee is convicted of or pleads guilty or nolo contendere
with respect to a crime involving moral turpitude, whether or not any
appeal or other proceeding is pending to have the conviction or plea set
aside.

(2) After completion of the appellate process if the conviction has not been
reversed or the plea has not been set aside with respect to a crime
involving moral turpitude, a disciplinary panel shall order the revocation
of a license on the certification by the Office of the Attorney General.

Md. Code Ann., Health Occupations Article (“Health Occ.”) § 14-404(b) (2021 Repl. Vol.).
Attached to the Petition were a certified copy of the indictment, the plea agreement that included
a stipulation of facts, certified copies of docket entries, transcript of the hearing for guilty plea,
judgment, and transcript of the sentencing hearing.

On July 20, 2022, Dr. Baako, through his counsel, filed a response to the Petition and

show cause order. Dr. Baako contended that 18 U.S.C. § 1542 is not a crime of moral turpitude,
arguing it does not involve fraud.
Having reviewed and considered the entire record in this case, Board Disciplinary Panel
B (“Panel B” or “the “Panel’”) issues this Final Decision and Order. COMAR 10.32.02.07H(1).

3. On July 31, 2019, Dr. Baako entered into a plea agreement, which contains a
Stipulation of Facts that formed the basis of the guilty plea, which states the
following:

The undersigned parties stipulate and agree that if this case had
proceeded to trial, this Office [United States Attorney’s Office for the
District of Maryland] would have proven the following facts beyond a
reasonable doubt. The undersigned parties also stipulate and agree that
the following facts do not encompass all of the evidence that would have
been presented had this matter proceeded to trial.

The Defendant [Michael N. Baako, M.D.] is an alien born in May,
1969, in Kwanyako, Ghana to Anothony Baako and Paulina Eduah, both
Ghanian nations. The Defendant is a national of Ghana and knows that
he is not, nor has ever been, a citizen or national of the United States.

The Defendant is a physician who has practiced medicine in
Maryland hospitals. He has also maintained his own clinic under the
name Biazo Healthcare.

The Defendant Enters Into the United States and is Licensed as a
Foreign Medical Graduate

 

On October 24, 1988, the Defendant obtained a Ghanian passport in
Accra, Ghana, as a Ghanian national.

On October 28, 1995, the Defendant and R.A.A, were married in
Kumasi, Ghana. On December 5, 1995, [Defendant] and R.A.A. applied
for nonimmigrant B1/B2 visas to allow them to visit the United States.
[Defendant’s] application accurately listed his date and place of birth.
[Defendant’s] visa was issued to him at the United States Embassy in
Accra, Ghana for use with his Ghanaian passport.

On at least two occasions in 1996, [Defendant] used his Ghanaian
passport to enter the United States. On October 4, 1996, the Defendant
was issued a new Ghanaian passport.

Beginning in 1996, [Defendant] applied for certification of his
Ghanaian medical education in the United States through the Educational
Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates. In conjunction with this

? Count four of the indictment charged that Dr. Baako willfully, knowingly, and falsely stated that he was a United
States citizen born in North Carolina on February 20, 2018, on his DS-82 application for passport renewal.

3
application, [Defendant] supplied a number of forms, photographs, and
supporting materials, accurately stating his date and place of birth, and
that he graduated from medical school in Ghana.

On March 13, 2001, the Maryland Department of Health and Mental
Hygiene granted [Defendant] a license to practice medicine in Maryland.

Beginning in at least 2001, [Defendant] and R.A.A. resided together
in Howard County, Maryland, and were the parents of two minor, United
States citizen children.

The Petition for the Defendant to be Granted U.S. Citizenship is
Denied

On March 11, 1998, the Defendant and “D.R.T.,” a United States
citizen, were married in Virginia.

On March 31, 1998, “D.R.T.” filed a petition for the Defendant to be
naturalized and become a United States citizen. The petition accurately
listed the Defendant’s date and place of birth.

On October 28, 1999, the Defendant made a sworn statement to
immigration officials stating in part that he was born in Ghana and was
not a United States citizen.

On June 20, 2000, immigration officials denied “D.R.T.” and the
Defendant’s petition for the Defendant to become a naturalized U.S.
citizen, after concluding that his marriage to “D.R.T.” was a “sham”

marriage entered into for the sole purpose of obtaining immigration
benefits.

The Defendant Petitions for a Passport for his Child and a Visa as
an Alien from Ghana

On April 2, 2002, a a Columbia, Maryland, U.S. Post Office, the
Defendant and R.A.A. submitted an application for a United States

United States, and as a citizen is entitled to a U.S. passport regardless of
the Defendant’s birthplace or citizenship. On the form, the Defendant
listed his place of birth as Ghana and checked the box for “NO” in

response to a question on the form asking whether he was a United
States citizen.

On March 31, 2004, the Defendant and R.A.A. submitted United
States “Diversity Visa” applications as Ghanaian nationals, including
photographs and birthdates. On July 14, 2005, the Defendant and
R.A.A. failed to appear for an interview with US. officials in Ghana, in

conjunction with their visa applications, and Diversity Visas were never
issued to them.

of Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration. In his voter registration
application, the Defendant falsely swore and affirmed under penalty of

 

perjury that he was a United States citizen.

Defendant Falsely Claims U.S. Birth and Citizenship to Obtain U.S.

Passports

On December 15, 2006, the Defendant obtained a new Ghanaian
passport in Accra, Ghana, as a Ghanaian national.

 
On April 17, 2007, at a U.S. Post Office in Fulton, Maryland, the
Defendant submitted a passport application on behalf of “Minor Child
1.” Jn this application, the Defendant falsely stated under penalty of
perjury that he was a citizen of the United States, and that he was born in
Hillsborough, North Carolina. On the form, the Defendant checked the
box for “YES” in response to a question on the form asking whether he
was a United States citizen.

On April 22, 2008, at a U.S. Post Office in Columbia, Maryland, the
Defendant submitted an application seeking a United States passport for
himself. In this application, the Defendant falsely stated under penalty
of perjury that he was a citizen or non-citizen national of the United
States, and that he was born in North Carolina. He also falsely stated in
the application that his parents were both born in North Carolina and his
wife, R.A.A., was born in South Carolina.

In support of his April 22, 2008, application for a U.S. passport, the
Defendant provided an affidavit from “B.Y.R.,” sworn under penalty of
perjury, falsely stating that the Defendant was born in Hillsborough,
North Carolina. The affidavit falsely stated that B.Y.R. was friends with
the Defendant’s parents in North Carolina and they were one of the first
people to see the Defendant after his birth, The affidavit also falsely
stated that B.Y.R. was present at a subsequent naming and baptism
ceremony for the Defendant at a Hillsborough, North Carolina church.

On April 29, 2008, the Defendant was issued a United States passport
including the false information that he was a citizen of the United States
born in North Carolina. The Defendant used his fraudulently obtained
United States passport for international travel on several occasions.

On September 16, 2009, at a U.S. Post Office in Fulton, Maryland,
the Defendant submitted a passport application on behalf of “Minor
Child 2.” Minor Child 2 was born in the United States, and as a citizen
is entitled to a U.S. passport regardless of the Defendant’s birthplace or
citizenship. In this application, the Defendant falsely stated under
penalty of perjury that he was a citizen of the United States, and that he
was born in Hillsborough, North Carolina. On the form, the Defendant
checked the box for “YES” in response to a question on the form asking
whether he was a United States citizen.

On April 22, 2010, in Fulton, Maryland, the Defendant was
interviewed by officials from the Department of State. During the
interview, he falsely stated that he was a citizen born in North Carolina.

On July 31, 2012, in Fulton, Maryland, the Defendant submitted an
application for a United States Passport renewal on behalf of “Minor
Child 1.” In this application, the Defendant falsely stated under penalty
of perjury that he was a citizen of the United States, and that he was born
in Hillsborough, North Carolina. On the form, the Defendant checked
the box for “YES” in response to a question on the form asking whether
he was a United States citizen.

On February 20, 2018, in Fulton, Maryland, the Defendant submitted
an application to renew the United States passport previously issued to
him. In this application, the Defendant falsely stated under penalty of
perjury that he was a citizen or non-citizen national of the United States,
and that he was born in North Carolina.

On June 12, 2018, in Washington, District of Columbia, the
Defendant falsely stated to Department of State officials that he was born
at home in Hillsborough, North Carolina and moved to Ghana when he
was approximately one year old. He also falsely stated that he never
applied for any immigration benefit with United States immigration
authorities and that he never submitted any documents in an attempt to
become a naturalized citizen.

On May 8, 2019, law enforcement officers executed a search warrant
at the Defendant’s residence in Howard County, Maryland. During the
search, investigators located the Ghanaian passport that the Defendant
obtained in 2006 and plans for the three-bedroom home the Defendant
purchased in Accra, Ghana in August 2012. Investigators also obtained
a number of documents related to the [D]efendant’s ongoing efforts to
fraudulently obtain documentation establishing that he was a U.S. citizen
born in North Carolina, including: a false affidavit purporting to be
sworn by Defendant’s mother—claiming that he was born in North
Carolina; a Defendant at his birth in North Carolina; a falsified baptism
certificate purporting to be from a North Carolina church—certifying
that the [D]efendant was born in North Carolina; and several draft
petitions to the Circuit Court for Howard County seeking to fraudulently
establish the fact of his birth in North Carolina.

Dr. Baako signed the Stipulation of Facts.

4. On July 31, 2019, Dr. Baako pleaded guilty to Count 4, Passport Fraud, 18 U.S.C. §
1542.

5. On September 27, 2019, for his violation of Count 4 of the Indictment, the U.S.
District Court sentenced Dr. Baako to 15 months of incarceration followed by three years

> Count four of the indictment, the count to which Dr. Baako pleaded guilty, concerns his February 20, 2018,

application on which Dr. Baako knowingly, willfully, and falsely stated that he was a U.S. citizen born in North
Carolina,
of supervised release, and a special assessment of $100. The judgment was issued on
September 30, 2019. The remaining counts were dismissed.

6. Dr. Baako did not appeal his conviction within the time prescribed by law and the
guilty plea and conviction have not been set aside.

DISCUSSION

Pursuant to COMAR 10.32.02.07E(2), Dr. Baako had the opportunity to respond to the
order to show cause, in writing, to address the following limited issues: “(a) Lack of conviction
or plea; (b) Whether the crime is one involving moral turpitude; (c) Misidentity of the respondent
with the defendant in the criminal matter, and (d) Other relevant issues, if any, other than
mitigation.” Dr. Baako argues that the crime that he pleaded guilty to, and was convicted of, 18
U.S.C. § 1542, did not involve moral turpitude, because, according to Dr, Baako, “the offense
only requires a false and not a fraudulent statement in an application for a passport.”

Under Health Occ. §14-404(b)(2), a disciplinary panel has the obligation and discretion
to determine what types of crimes are crimes involving moral turpitude for licensing and
disciplinary purposes. “[I]t is settled that whatever else [moral turpitude] may mean . . . a crime
in which an intent to defraud is an essential element is a crime involving moral turpitude. It is
also settled that the related group of offenses involving intentional dishonesty for purposes of
personal gain are crimes involving moral turpitude[.]” Attorney Grievance Comm'n of Mad. vy.
Walman, 280 Md. 453, 459-60 (1977). “[I]n the context of a licensing board’s review of the
conduct of its licensee, the concept of moral turpitude is rather broad.” Oltman v. Maryland State
Bd. Of Physicians, 162 Md. App. 457, 483 (2005).

“Determining whether an individual has been convicted of a crime involving moral
turpitude ‘necessarily begins with an examination of the criminal statute itself.” Burke v.

Maryland Bd. of Physicians, 250 Md. App. 334, 348 (2021) (quoting Walman, 280 Md. at 460)).
Maryland appellate courts have repeatedly held that if dishonesty, fraud, or intent to deceive is
an essential element of a statute under which a defendant is convicted, the crime involves moral
turpitude as a matter of law. See Board of Physician Quality Assurance v. Felsenberg, 351 Md.
288, 295 (1998) (crimes involving fraud are crimes involving moral turpitude); Attorney
Grievance Comm'n v. Klauber, 289 Md. 446, 457-59, cert. denied, 451 U.S. 1018 (1981) (the
term “moral turpitude” connotes a fraudulent or dishonest intent); Walman, 280 Md. at 459-60;
Oltman, 162 Md. App. at 485-87.

The statutory text is clear that an intent to deceive is an essential element of passport
fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 1542, the crime that Dr. Baako pleaded guilty to. In pleading guilty, Dr.
Baako acknowledged that he knowingly and willfully made a false statement on an application
for a United States passport and that the false statement was made with the intent to secure the
issuance of a passport for his use or the use of another. And Dr. Baako deliberately made a false
application statement for a passport for himself, which is a criminal offense involving intentional
dishonesty the purpose of personal gain. Therefore, the criminal offense to which Dr. Baako was
convicted, 18 U.S. C. § 1542 (first paragraph), based on the elements of the crime alone,
involves moral turpitude.

Upon determining that a licensee has been convicted of a crime involving moral
turpitude, Health Occ. § 14-404(b)(2) requires a disciplinary panel to order the revocation of a
license after the appellate proceedings have been completed.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Panel B concludes that Dr. Baako’s conviction for passport fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 1542 (first

paragraph), is a crime involving moral turpitude. As a result, Health Occ. § 14-404(b)(2)

requires Panel B to revoke Dr. Baako’s license to practice medicine in Maryland.
ORDER

It is, on an affirmative vote of a majority of the quorum of Panel B, hereby:

ORDERED that the license of Michael N. Baako, M.D., license number D57216, to
practice medicine in Maryland is REVOKED, as mandated by Health Occ. § 14-404(b)(2); and
it is further

ORDERED that this is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT. See Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 1-

607, 14-411.1(b)(2) and Gen. Prov. § 4-333(b)(6).
