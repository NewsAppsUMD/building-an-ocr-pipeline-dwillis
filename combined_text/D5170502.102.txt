Case No.: 7721-0139
License No.: D51705

Dear Dr. Pansuriya and Counsel:

On January 28, 2022, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov't § 10-226(c)(2). On February
9, 2022, Dr. Pansuriya was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing before
Disciplinary Panel A to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. Dr. Pansuriya
was represented at the hearing on that date by his counsel, Barry C. Goldstein, Esq. The State
was represented by Gregory Lockwood, Assistant Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor.
Both parties presented oral arguments at the post-deprivation hearing.

After consideration of the parties’ presentations of, Disciplinary Panel A determined, bya
preponderance of the evidence, that the health, safety, and welfare of the public imperatively
required the disciplinary panel to summarily suspend Dr. Pansuriya’s license and that there exists
a substantial risk of serious harm to the public health, safety, and welfare in Dr. Pansuriya’s
continued practice. Disciplinary Panel A thus will not lift the summary suspension order and the

summary suspension imposed on January 28, 2022, is reaffirmed and continues in effect, See
COMAR 10.32.02.08H(1).
