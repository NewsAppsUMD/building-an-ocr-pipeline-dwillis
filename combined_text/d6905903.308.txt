Columbia Board of Medicine (the “DC Board”) took disciplinary action against him for
engaging in an inappropriate relationship with a patient and for failing to properly
document an examination of the same patient.

provisions of D.C. Official Code § 3-1205.14(a): (9) Willfully fails to file or record any
medical report as required by law; and (26) Fails to conform to standards of acceptable
conduct and prevailing practice within a health profession. Pursuant to the Consent
Order, the D.C. Board suspended the Respondent's District of Columbia medical
license for six months, which it immediately stayed, and placed him on probation for

three years, subject to probationary terms and conditions.
6. The Respondent resolved the Board’s investigation of him by entering into
a Consent Order, dated March 20, 2014, in which the Board found as a matter of law
that the Respondent’s professional misconduct in the District of Columbia violated the
following provision of the Maryland Medical Practice Act (the “Act”): Md. Code Ann.,

14-404(a)(12) Willfully fails to file or record any medical report as required by law,
willfully impedes or obstructs the filing or recording of the report, or induces another to
fail to file or record the report.

8. Pursuant to the Consent Order, the Board suspended the Respondent's
Maryland medical license, which it immediately stayed, and placed him on probation,
subject to his successful compliance with the terms and conditions of the DC Board
Consent Order, dated January 24, 2014.

9. On January 28, 2015, the DC Board, pursuant to a Termination Order,
terminated the terms and conditions it had imposed against the Respondent's medical
license pursuant to its January 24, 2014, Consent Order.

10. Asa result, on March 25, 2015, the Board issued an Order Terminating
Suspension and Probation, in which it terminated the Respondent's suspension and

probation, imposed under its March 20, 2014, Consent Order.
lil. © CURRENT INVESTIGATIVE FINDINGS

11. In or around April 2017, the Board initiated an investigation of the
Respondent under Board Case Number 2217-0049A after receiving information from
the Arlington County, Virginia, Police Department that on two dates (January 24 and
March 9, 2017), the Respondent had overdosed on controlled dangerous substances
(“CDS”) and experienced seizures. The Respondent was hospitalized in both incidents.

12. In the first incident, on January 24, 2017, emergency services responded
to the Respondent's residence after receiving a report that he had overdosed and was
having a seizure. After the Respondent regained consciousness, he stated that he had
taken and overdosed on Tramadol 25 mg samples (Tramadol is an opioid and Schedule
IV CDS).

13. In the second incident, on March 9, 2017, emergency services personnel
responded to the Respondent's residence to treat the Respondent, who had again
overdosed on CDS. After the Respondent was hospitalized, he stated to police that he
had intravenously injected and overdosed on cocaine, and that he had misrepresented
that he had taken Tramadol.

14. By letter dated June 16, 2017, the Board requested that the Respondent
provide a response to allegations that he was hospitalized after overdosing on a CDS.

15. By letter dated July 7, 2017, the Respondent provided a written response
to the Board in which he admitted to an “addiction” and that he “overdosed, and needed
medical attention, on January 24 and March 9, 2017.” The Respondent stated that after
the March 9, 2017, overdose and hospitalization, he underwent in-patient treatment and
is currently under the supervision of the Medical Society of the District of Columbia’s

Physician Health Program (“MSDC-HP’”).
16. On August 28, 2017, the Respondent consented to an under-oath
interview by Board investigators. In this interview, the Respondent admitted that he
began using cocaine approximately two and one-half years prior to the date of the
interview, which over time escalated to use on a weekly basis. The Respondent
admitted that his route of ingestion was through inhalation or injection. The Respondent
admitted that in both instances where he was transported by emergency medical
services to a hospital (/.e., on January 24 and March 9, 2017), he had used cocaine,
which precipitated seizures. The Respondent denied telling police/emergency services
responders that he used Tramadol. The Respondent claimed that he had not
used/abused any CDS since his March 9, 2017, overdose.

17. On or about March 13, 2018, the Board received a comprehensive
evaluation report concerning the Respondent.”

18. Based on the investigative facts and the Respondent's acknowledged use
of cocaine, Panel A finds that the Respondent presents a substantial likelihood of a risk
of serious harm to the public health, safety and welfare.
