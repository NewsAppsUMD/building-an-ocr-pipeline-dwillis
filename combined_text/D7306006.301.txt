Panel A takes such action pursuant to its authority under Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-
226(c) (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2020 Supp.), concluding that the public health, safety, or welfare

imperatively requires emergency action.
INVESTIGATIVE FINDINGS!

Based on information received by, and made known to Panel A, and the
investigatory information obtained by, received by, and made known to and available to
Panel A, including the instances described below, Panel A has reason to believe that the

following facts are true:

L BACKGROUND

+ The statements regarding Panel A’s investigative findings are intended to provide the Respondent with reasonable
notice of the basis of the suspension. They are not intended as, and do not necessarily represent, a complete description
of the evidence, either documentary or testimonial, to be offered against the Respondent in connection with this matter.
IL.

1. At all times relevant hereto, the Respondent was and is licensed to practice

medicine in the State of Maryland. The Respondent was originally licensed to
practice medicine in Maryland on September 20, 2011, under License Number

D73060. The Respondent’s license is current through September 30, 2021.

. The Respondent is board certified in dermatology.

. On or about December 16, 2020, the Board received a notification from the

Federation of State Medical Boards (“FSMB”) that the Respondent had agreed
to a Consent Order (the “D.C. Consent Order’) with the Government of the
District of Columbia Board of Medicine (the “D.C. Board”) on September 2,
2020. The D.C. Consent Order provided, in part, that the Respondent would not
practice medicine in the District of Columbia during the remainder of his then-
current license term which ended December 31, 2020. Furthermore, it provided
that the Respondent would not attempt to renew his District of Columbia medical
license when it expired and would not attempt to petition for reinstatement of

his District of Columbia medical license in the future.

. Based on the D.C. Consent Order, the Board opened an investigation.

BOARD INVESTIGATION

. In furtherance of its investigation, Board staff subpoenaed the D.C. Board’s

investigative file.

. On or about January 22, 2021, the Board received the investigative file from the

D.C. Board. A review of the investigative file revealed that on or about January

22, 2016, the D.C. Board received a complaint from the father (the

2
“Complainant”) of an individual with whom the Respondent was romantically
involved. In the complaint, the Complainant alleged that the Respondent was
engaged in the use of an illicit substance.”

7. On or about March 11, 2021, Board staff contacted the Respondent requesting
that he sign an authorization for release of medical information. On March 18,
2021, the Respondent informed Board staff that he was “not favorably inclined”
to provide the information requested.

8. On or about April 14, 2021, Board staff sent the Respondent written
correspondence notifying him that a full investigation had been opened. The
Board also notified the Respondent that he was being directed to appear at the
Maryland Professional Rehabilitation Program (“MPRP”) on April 19, 2021, for
an examination pursuant to Health Occ. § 14-402(a)?. The Respondent was also
notified that failure to submit to an examination is evidence of the inability to
practice medicine in accordance with Health Occ. §14-402(c)*.

9. On April 19, 2021, MPRP notified Board staff that the Respondent failed to

confirm his appointment and did not appear as scheduled.

? Additional relevant information included in the complaint has not been specifically referenced in this document for
confidentiality and privacy purposes.

3 14-402(a) In general - In reviewing an application for licensure or in investigating an allegation brought against a
licensed physician or any allied health professional regulated by the Board under this title, the Physician Rehabilitation
Program may request the Board to direct, or the Board or a disciplinary panel on its own initiative may direct, the
licensed physician or any allied health professional regulated by the Board under this title to submit to an appropriate
examination.

4 14-402(c) Failure to submit to examination — The unreasonable failure or refusal of the licensed individual to
submit to an examination is prima facie evidence of the licensed individual’s inability to practice medicine or the
respective discipline competently, unless the Board of disciplinary panel finds that the failure or refusal was beyond
the control of the licensed individual.
10. On or about April 19, 2021, Board staff sent the Respondent a letter providing
him with another opportunity to comply with the examination requirement on
April 26, 2021. The Respondent confirmed the appointment but notified MPRP
that he would be running late for his appointment. MPRP staff informed the
Respondent that they would allow him only a few additional minutes to begin
participating in the evaluation. MPRP staff waited an additional twenty (20)

minutes and the Respondent failed to appear for the evaluation.

—

.On April 26, 2021, Board staff provided the Respondent a final opportunity to
appear for the Health Occ. § 14-402(a) examination on May 4, 2021. The
Respondent appeared as directed. MPRP staff subsequently informed the Board
that the Respondent refused to sign releases for records of his prior medical
history or provide MPRP with the names of other medical providers.

12.On or about May 5, 2021, the Respondent indicated to MPRP that he would

provide the requested documents and information. MPRP staff gave the
Respondent a final deadline of May 10, 2021, to comply with their request.
13. On May 6, 2021,° the Respondent was directed by MPRP staff to report for urine

toxicology screening?® later that day. The Respondent complied.

> MPRP initially directed the Respondent to complete toxicology screening on May 5, 2021, but the facility was
closed. The Respondent completed the initial toxicology screening on May 6, 2021.
® The results of the toxicology screening are not disclosed in this document but are available to the Respondent.

4
14.On May 10, 2021, the Respondent was directed by MPRP staff to complete hair
toxicology screening on May 11, 2021. MPRP utilizes hair toxicology screening
because of its broader window of detection.’

15.On May 12, 2021, MPRP staff was notified that the Respondent failed to
complete the hair toxicology screening.

16.On May 12, 2021, the Respondent emailed MPRP staff and stated that he “[did]
not wish to provide any names or sign any other consents at this time,” and that
he was “not willing to continue to jump through hoops.”

17. As a result of the Respondent’s failure to complete the hair toxicology screening,
as well as his failure to sign releases for his prior medical records or comply with
MPRP’s previous requests for additional information, MPRP was unable to

complete the Health Occ. § 14-402(a) examination.
