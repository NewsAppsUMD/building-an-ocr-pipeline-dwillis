Case No.: 2016-0465A.
License No.: D37592

Dear Dr. Babaturk and Mr. Kao:

On February 25, 2016, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t II, § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014
Repl. Vol.). On March 9, 2016, Dr. Babaturk was given an opportunity to attend a hearing before
Disciplinary Panel A to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. Dr. Babaturk
attended the hearing on that date. The State was represented by Michael Kao, Assistant Attorney
General, Administrative Prosecutor. Both parties presented extensive oral arguments at the show
cause hearing.

After considering these arguments at the hearing and the investigative file, Disciplinary
Panel A determined that it would continue the summary suspension imposed on February 25,
2016. Disciplinary Panel A thus will not lift the summary suspension order. The arguments
submitted, together with Dr. Babaturk’s presentation and responses to the Panel’s questions,
when considered in the light of the investigative findings in the file, persuade Disciplinary Panel
A that there exists a substantial risk of serious harm to the public health, safety or welfare in Dr.
Babaturk’s continued practice. Disciplinary Panel A, through its counsel, advised Dr. Babaturk
of this decision orally on the hearing date.

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, Dr. Babaturk has the right to request a full evidentiary
hearing before an Administrative Law Judge. This request will be granted if the Board receives
a written request for the hearing within ten days of the date of this letter. Any request for a
hearing should be sent to Christine Farrelly, Executive Director, at the Board’s address. If Dr.
Babaturk requests such a hearing, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set
the hearing to begin within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08 I, though Dr.
Babaturk may waive that 30-day requirement.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel A resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Pperely yours,

  

Christine A. Farrelly,
Maryland State Board o'
