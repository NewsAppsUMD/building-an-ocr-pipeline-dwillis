Re: Daniel D. Dietrick, M.D.
Case No.: 2224-0048
License No.: D45331

Dear Dr. Dietrick, Mr. Marcus, and Mr. Kao:

On November 22, 2023, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i).

Pursuant to the Order, on January 10, 2024, Disciplinary Panel A held a post-deprivation
hearing to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. Dr. Dietrick and his
counsel, Mr. Marcus, attended the hearing on that date. The State was represented by Michael
Kao, Assistant Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor. Both parties presented oral
arguments at the hearing.

After considering these arguments at the hearing and the documents in the investigative
file and a document submitted by Dr. Dietrick, Disciplinary Panel A determined that it would
continue the summary suspension imposed on November 22, 2023. Disciplinary Panel A thus
will not lift the summary suspension order. Disciplinary Panel A finds that the public health,
safety. or welfare imperatively requires the suspension of Dr. Dietrick’s license. See State Gov’t,
§ 10-226(c)(2)(i). The order of summary suspension is thus reaffirmed and continues. See

COMAR 10.32.02.08H(1).

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, Dr. Dietrick has the right to request a full evidentiary
hearing before an Administrative Law Judge at the Office of Administrative Hearings. To
receive the evidentiary hearing, Dr. Dietrick or his counsel must file the request for the hearing
within TEN (10) days of the date of this letter. The request for a hearing should be sent to
Christine A. Farrelly, Executive Director, at the Board’s address. If the hearing is timely
requested, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set the hearing to begin
within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.081, though that 30-day time period may be
waived.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel A resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.
