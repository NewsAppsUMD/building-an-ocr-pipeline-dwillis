Case No.: 2220-0265
License No.: D59928

Dear Dr. Myers, Mr. Murphy, and Mr. Malizio:

On January 12, 2021, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann.,
State Goy’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2019 Supp.).

Pursuant to the Order, on January 27, 2021, Disciplinary Panel B held a postdeprivation hearing
to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. Dr. Myers, and his counsel, Mr.
Murphy attended the hearing on that date. The State was represented by Adam Malizio,
Assistant Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor. Both parties presented oral arguments at
the hearing.

After considering these arguments at the hearing and documents in the investigative file,
Disciplinary Panel B determined that it would continue the summary suspension imposed on
January 12, 2021. Disciplinary Panel B thus will not lift the summary suspension order,
Disciplinary Panel B finds that the public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires the
suspension of Dr. Myers’s license, See State Gov’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i). The order of summary
suspension is thus reaffirmed and continues. See COMAR 10.32.02.08H(1).

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel B resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.
