Disciplinary Panel B (“Panel B”) of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the
“Board”) hereby SUMMARILY SUSPENDS the medical license of ALICE O. ADAMS,
M.D. (the “Respondent’), License Number D52085, to practice in the State of
Maryland. Panel B takes such action pursuant to its authority under Md. Code Ann.,
State Gov't § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2017 Supp.), concluding that the public
health, safety, or welfare imperatively requires emergency action.

INVESTIGATIVE FINDINGS

Based on information received by, and made known to Panel B, and the
investigatory information obtained by, received by and made known to and available to
Panel B and the Office of the Attorney General, including the instances described
below, Panel B has reason to believe that the following facts are true:'

1. At all times relevant, the Respondent was a physician licensed to practice

medicine in the State of Maryland. The Respondent was initially licensed in Maryland

+The statements regarding the Respondent's conduct are intended to provide the Respondent with notice
of the basis of the suspension. They are not intended as, and do not necessarily represent a complete
description of the evidence, either documentary or testimonial, to be offered against the Respondent in
connection with this matter.
on or about May 30, 1997, and her license is scheduled to be renewed on September
30, 2018.

2. The Respondent was trained as a neurologist, but is not board-certified in any
specialty. At all times relevant she was employed part-time at a facility in Temple Hills,
Maryland (‘Facility A”);2 and part-time at a Rehabilitation facility in the District of
Columbia.

3. On or about September 20, 2017, the Board received a complaint from the wife
of a former patient (“Patient A”) alleging that during her husband’s appointment the
Respondent appeared to be impaired by exhibiting slurred speech and repetitive
questioning. The complainant further alleged that the Respondent's office was “dirty.”

4. After receiving the complaint, the Board initiated an investigation, and on
November 1, 2017, Board staff conducted an on-site visit of Facility A.>

5. During the November 1, 2017 on-site visit, Board staff hand-delivered a copy of
the complaint to the Respondent and issued to her subpoenas for appointment logs and
employee lists.

6. On or about November 3, 2017, and again on December 1, 2017, the
Respondent filed with the Board written responses to the complaint denying the
allegations as set forth in the complaint.

7. Board staff interviewed the complainant and Patient A and the Respondent, and

subpoenaed the Respondent’s Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (“PDMP”) records

* In order to maintain confidentiality, identifying names will be used in this document, but will be provided
to the Respondent on request.
3 Board staff had conducted a prior on-site visit in October 2017; however, the Respondent was not
present. During that visit, Board staff took photographs of Facility A.

and pharmacy records which reflected prescriptions issued to the Respondent for
controlled dangerous substances (“CDS”) including opioids and benzodiazepines.

8. Following a review of the investigative documents and after interviewing the
Respondent regarding the allegations, in furtherance of its investigation, on or about
January 24, 2018, the Board ordered that the Respondent be evaluated by the
Maryland Professional Rehabilitation Program (“MPRP’”).

9. On or about February 8, 2018, the Respondent presented to MPRP for the Board
ordered evaluation. As part of its evaluation, the MPRP referred the Respondent to a
psychiatrist specializing in addiction (“Dr. F”). On or about February 22, 2018, Dr. F
conducted an evaluation of the Respondent.

10. On or about February 26, 2018, Dr. F sent to Board staff a PDMP printout of
multiple CDS prescriptions that had been issued to the Respondent by several different
providers between January 2014 and November 2017. The prescriptions had been
issued to her for Schedule II and III opioids and Schedule IV benzodiazepines.

11. On or about February 26, 2018, Dr. F sent an email to Board staff stating that in
his professional opinion, based on his evaluation of the Respondent, the Respondent's
personal and professional judgment is impaired and that “she poses a risk to her
patients in the practice of medicine...| feel it is prudent to act immediately for reasons of

public safety.”
12. On or about March 5, 2018, Dr. F submitted a written report to Board staff
summarizing his evaluation of the Respondent that stated in part:4
In my professional opinion, [the Respondent] is in need of immediate addiction

treatment as she is in complete denial of her dependency on opiates and
benzodiazepines.

| see significant evidence that [the Respondent’s] personal and professional

judgment is impaired and | feel she poses a risk to her patients in the practice of

medicine at this time...
