FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
PROCEDURAL HISTORY

Thomas F. Burke, M.D., was originally licensed to practice medicine in the State of
Maryland on July 21, 1995, under license number D47746.! On January 28, 2019, in the
Circuit Court for Harford County, Case Number 12-K-18-000271, Dr. Burke pled guilty to and
was convicted of five counts of prescribing, administering, manufacturing, distributing,
dispensing, or possessing a Controlled Dangerous Substance not in the course of his regular
professional duties and not in conformance with Title 5 of the Criminal Law Article and the
standards of the profession, in violation of Md. Code Ann., Criminal Law Article (Crim.
Law”) § 5-902(c) (2012 Repl. Vol. & 2018 Supp.).

The Court sentenced Dr. Burke to the maximum period of two years of incarceration for
each count, to be served consecutively, with all but three years suspended, for a total of ten years
with all but three years suspended and credit for time served. Dr. Burke was also sentenced to
three years of probation upon his release from incarceration with conditions that include the

surrender of his Drug Enforcement Administration and Maryland CDS registrations during the

' Dr. Burke’s license expired on September 30, 2018. Pursuant to section 14-403 of the Health Occupations Article,
the license of an individual regulated by the Board may not “lapse by operation of law while the individual is under
investigation or while charges are pending.” The Board’s investigation began before the expiration of Dr. Burke’s
license, Therefore, by operation of law, Dr. Burke’s license did not expire during these proceedings.
period of probation, random urinalysis, drug and alcohol evaluation, testing, and treatment, and
abstaining from alcohol and drugs.

On May 7, 2019, the Office of the Attorney General filed with the Maryland Board of
Physicians (the “Board”) a petition to revoke Dr. Burke’s license to medicine (“the Petition”)
and a show cause order pursuant to section 14-404(b) of the Maryland Medical Practice Act in
Case Number 2219-0154B. The statute provides:

qd) On the filing of certified docket entries with the Board by the Office of the
Attorney General, a disciplinary panel shall order the suspension of a
license if the licensee is convicted of or pleads guilty or nolo contendere
with respect to a crime involving moral turpitude, whether or not any
appeal or other proceeding is pending to have the conviction or plea set
aside.

(2) After completion of the appellate process if the conviction has not been
reversed or the plea has not been set aside with respect to a crime
involving moral turpitude, a disciplinary panel shall order the revocation
of a license on the certification by the Office of the Attorney General,

Md, Code Ann., Health Occupations Article (“Health Occ.”) § 14-404(b) (2014 Repl. Vol. &
2018 Supp.). Attached to the Petition were copies of the indictment, certified docket entries, and
transcript of the plea agreement and sentencing hearing.

On June 24, 2019, Dr. Burke, through his counsel, filed a response to the Petition and
show cause order and requested that the Panel deny the State’s Petition to Revoke and give Dr.
Burke the opportunity to address the Panel at a Disciplinary Committee for Case Resolution

(“DCCR”) Conference scheduled for September 25, 2019 at 9:00 a.m.” To the extent that Dr.

? On November 20, 2018, prior to Dr. Burke’s criminal convictions that gave rise to this case, Disciplinary Panel B
summarily suspended Dr, Burke’s medical license, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Government Article (State
Gov’t) § 10-226(c)(2) (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2018 Supp.), based on the panel’s conclusion that the public health,
safety, or welfare imperatively required emergency action. On December 3, 2018, Panel B charged Dr. Burke in
case number 2218-0155B, with violating Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii) (unprofessional conduct in the practice of
medicine) and (27) (sells, prescribes, gives away, or administers drugs for an illegitimate medical purpose). The
DCCR for that case is scheduled for September 25, 2019. In requesting the opportunity to appear at the DCCR to
address the Panel on this moral turpitude case, Dr. Burke confuses the process for resolution of disciplinary cases
charged under Health Occ. § 14-404(a) with cases charged under Health Occ. § 14-404(b). As the Court of Appeals

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Based on the above-discussion, Panel B concludes that Dr. Burke’s convictions for
prescribing CDS not in accordance with regular professional duties and not in conformance with
Title 5 of the Criminal Law Article and the standards of the authorized provider’s profession, in
violation of Crim. Law § 5-902(c), are crimes involving moral turpitude. As a result, Health
Occ, § 14-404(b)(2) requires Panel B to order the revocation of Dr. Burke’s license.

ORDER

It is, by Board Disciplinary Panel B, hereby:

ORDERED that the license of Thomas F, Burke, M.D., license number D47746, to
practice medicine in Maryland is REVOKED, as mandated by Health Occ. § 14-404(b)(2); and
it is further

ORDERED that the Summary Suspension imposed November 20, 2018, and affirmed on
November 28, 2018, is terminated as moot; and it further

ORDERED that the December 3, 2018 Charges, filed under Health Occ. § 14-404(a), in
Case Number 2218-0155B, are dismissed as moot; and it is further

ORDERED that the DCCR conference scheduled for September 25, 2019 is cancelled;
and it is further

ORDERED that this is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT. See Md. Code Ann.,, Health Occ. §§

1-607, 14-411.1(b)(2) and Gen. Prov. § 4-333(b)(6).

Burke’s request to address the Panel at the DCCR may be interpreted as a request for a hearing,
Board Disciplinary Panel B (“Panel B”) declines to grant Dr. Burke’s request for a hearing
pursuant to the Code of Maryland Regulations (“COMAR”) 10.32.02.07E(3).°

Having reviewed and considered the entire record in this case, Panel: B issues this Final

Decision and Order.

FINDINGS OF FACT
Panel B finds the following:

1, On March 2, 2018, the grand jury in the Circuit Court for Harford County returned a
sixty-two count indictment against Dr. Burke, in case number 12-K-18-00271, charging
him with unlawful possession of a Controlled Dangerous Substance (“CDS”) and drug
paraphernalia, conspiracy to distribute CDS, distribution of CDS, and unlawfully

_ prescribing CDS outside of the standards of the provider’s profession.

2. On January 28, 2019, Dr. Burke entered into a negotiated plea agreement wherein he pled
guilty to five counts (counts 13, 16, 40, 47 and 59) of prescribing, administering,
manufacturing, distributing, dispensing, or possessing CDS not in the course of his
regular professional duties and not in conformance with Title 5 of the Criminal Law
Article and the standards of the profession, in violation of Crim. Law § 5-902(c).’ In
exchange for his plea of guilty, the remaining charges were dismissed.

 

has explained, the procedure is different for resolution of cases under Health Occ. § 14-404(a) and cases under
Health Occ. § 14-404(b) where there has already been an opportunity for a hearing and an adjudication on the
criminal charges, See Maryland Bd. of Phys. Quality Assurance vy, Felsenberg, 351 Md, 288, 292-95 (1998). Unlike
cases charged under Health Occ. § 14-404(a), a limited evidentiary hearing is discretionary for cases charged under
Health Oce, § 14-404(b). See infra, pp 4-S; COMAR 10.32.02.07E(3).

> In 2013, pursuant to Health Occ. § 14-401, the Board was divided into two disciplinary panels to resolve
disciplinary actions against physicians, See House Bill 1096, ch. 401, 2013 Md. Laws 3542, This case was
considered and decided by Disciplinary Panel B of the Board.

“ Section 5-902 of the Criminal Law Article provides, in pertinent part:

(c) An authorized provider may not prescribe, administer, manufacture, distribute, dispense, or
possess a controlled dangerous substance, drug paraphernalia, or controlled paraphernalia except:
(1) in the course of regular professional duties; and
(2) in conformity with this title and the standards of the authorized provider's profession
relating to controlled dangerous substances, drug paraphernalia, or controlled
paraphernalia,
ok
(ec) (1) If the trier of fact specifically finds that a person has knowingly or intentionally violated
this section, the person is guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction is subject to imprisonment
not exceeding 2 years or a fine not exceeding $100,000 or both.
(2) In all other cases, a person who violates this section is subject to a civil penalty not exceeding
$50,000.
3, Counts 13, 16, 40, 47 and 59 charge Dr. Burke with unlawfully intentionally and
knowingly, as an authorized provider, prescribing, administering, manufacturing,
distributing, dispensing, or possessing a CDS not in the course of regular professional
duties and not in conformance with Title 5 of the Criminal Law Article and the standards
of the authorized provider's profession.

4, In accepting Dr. Burke’s guilty plea, the Court found that Dr. Burke understood the
nature of the charges, the trial and appellate rights he was surrendering, and the other
possible negative consequences of a guilty finding. The Court found that Dr. Burke
knowingly, freely, voluntarily and intelligently entered the plea of guilty.

5. Thereafter, the Court sentenced Dr. Burke to ten years of incarceration, with all but three
years suspended, and gave credit for time served. Dr. Burke was sentenced to three years
of probation effective upon his release from incarceration with conditions that included
the surrender of Dr. Burke’s Drug Enforcement Administration and Maryland CDS
registrations during the period of probation, random urinalysis, drug and alcohol
evaluation, testing, and treatment, and abstaining from alcohol and drugs.

6. Dr. Burke did not appeal his convictions within the time prescribed by law and the guilty
plea and convictions have not been set aside.

DISCUSSION

Pursuant to COMAR 10.32.02.07E(2), a response to a show cause order must be limited
to the following issues: “(a) Lack of conviction or plea; (b) Whether the crime is one involving
moral turpitude; (c) Misidentity of the respondent with the defendant in the criminal matter; and
(d) Other relevant issues, if any, other than mitigation.” Dr. Burke does not deny that he pled
guilty to five counts of prescribing, administering, manufacturing, distributing, dispensing, or
possessing a CDS not in the course of regular professional duties and not in conformance with
Title 5 of the Criminal Law Article and the standards of the authorized provider’s profession,
Nor does he argue that he was misidentified as the defendant in the criminal case. Rather, Dr.
Burke argues that (1) the crime he pled guilty to is not a crime involving moral turpitude; and (2)

he should be entitled to address the Panel, respond to questions, and explain the mitigating
circumstances that led to his guilty plea at the DCCR scheduled for September 25, 2019.°
Consideration of mitigating factors, however, is prohibited by the Board’s regulations. See
COMAR 10.32.02.04E(2)(d). This prohibition also comports with the intent of the statute to
“direct{] summary treatment of a charge based on the conviction of a crime of moral turpitude.”
Felsenberg, 351 Md. at 288. The only issue for Panel B to resolve, therefore, is whether
prescribing CDS not in the course of regular professional duties and not in conformance with
Title 5 of the Criminal Law Article and the standards of the authorized provider’s profession is a
crime involving moral turpitude.
Crime of Moral Turpitude

Health Occ. §14-404(b)(2) mandates the automatic revocation of a physician’s medical
license when a disciplinary panel concludes that a physician was convicted of a crime involving
moral turpitude. “Ordinarily, the question [of whether a crime involves moral turpitude] arises in
the case of witnesses who have been convicted of infamous crimes or those involving moral
turpitude and whose credibility is impeached by the asking whether they have been so
convicted.” Board of Dental Exam’rs v. Lazzell, 172 Md. 314 (1937). Accordingly, in defining
the concept of moral turpitude, “‘it is settled that whatever else it may mean, it includes fraud
and that a crime in which an intent to defraud is an essential element is a crime involving moral

20

turpitude.’” Oltman v. Maryland State Bd. of Physicians, 162 Md. App. 457, 486 (2005)
(quoting Attorney Grievance Comm’n of Md. v. Walman, 280 Md, 453, 459-60 (1977))
(emphasis in original),

Under Health Occ. §14-404(b)(2), a disciplinary panel has the obligation to determine
what types of crimes are crimes of moral turpitude for licensing and disciplinary purposes.

5 As discussed above, the DCCR was scheduled in connection with charges filed under Health Occ. § 14-404(a) in
Case Number 2218-0155B,
Maryland appellate courts have held that the term “moral turpitude” is more broadly defined with
respect to Board licensure and discipline than in a witness impeachment context. See Ricketts v.
State, 291 Md. 701, 711-12 (1981) (“[W]hat constitutes a crime of moral turpitude may involve
different considerations compelling different results in different circumstances.”). In the context
of licensure and discipline, the term moral turpitude “strikes the broader chord of public
confidence in the administration of government. That is, a person who has credibility to testify
[at trial] may not have the public’s confidence to practice certain professions[.]” Stidwell v.
Maryland State Bd. of Chiropractic Exam’rs, 144 Md. App. 613, 619 (2002). Thus, it is well
established that “in the context of a licensing board’s review of the conduct of its licensee, the
concept of moral turpitude is rather broad.” Oltman, 162 Md. App. at 483. In the licensure
context, “[t]he term ‘moral turpitude’ has been defined generally as importing ‘an act of
baseness, vileness or depravity in the private and social duties which a man owes to his fellow:
men, or to society in general, contrary to the accepted and customary rule of right and duty
between man and man,’” Walman, 280 Md. at 459 (quoting Braverman y, Bar Ass'n of Balt.
City, 209 Md. 328, 344, cert. denied, 352 U.S. 830 (1956)).

The Court of Appeals has also established that “[a] guilty plea is an admission of conduct
that constitutes all the elements of a formal criminal charge” and that [bly entering a plea of
guilty, the accused is not simply stating that he did the discrete acts described in the indictment;
he is admitting guilt of a substantive crime.” Metheny y. State, 359 Md. 576, 599 (2000)
(internal citations and quotation marks omitted). A guilty plea “also serves as a stipulation that
no proof by the prosecution need [be] advanced. . . . It supplies both evidence and verdict, [thus]

ending [the] controversy.” Id.
Dr. Burke’s Crimes Involved Moral Turpitude

Dr. Burke argues that the crime he pled guilty to is not a crime involving moral turpitude.
In his guilty plea, Dr. Burke admitted that his conduct constituted all the elements of the criminal
charges. In so pleading, he admitted that he, as an authorized provider, intentionally and
knowingly prescribed, administered, manufactured, distributed, dispensed or possessed CDS not
in the course of his regular professional duties and not in conformance with Title 5 of the
Criminal Law Article and the standards of the profession. Dr. Burke did not dispute the elements
of the charges to which he pled guilty and he accepted the plea agreement. Dr, Burke cannot
now challenge the sufficiency of the evidence or collaterally attack the final judgment entered
upon the Court’s acceptance of his guilty plea. See Oltman, 162 Md. App. at 487 (“[A]ppellant
cannot now collaterally attack the conclusive final judgment of the criminal court in his case, ...
To the contrary, the . . . court’s final judgment is conclusive proof of [appellant’s] guilt of the
crime charged.”) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), The Court of Appeals has
established that although violations of the Maryland Controlled Substances Act “will ordinarily
involve moral turpitude, each case must be decided on its own facts.” Attorney Grievance
Comm’n of Maryland vy, Proctor, 309 Md. 412, 419 (1987).

Through his guilty plea, Dr. Burke admitted to knowingly and intentionally issuing
prescriptions for CDS not in accordance with his regular professional duties and outside of the
standards of the medical profession. Dr. Burke’s conduct was not just outside of the acceptable
standards of medical practice; it was illegal. As the Court stated to Dr. Burke during sentencing,
“I am absolutely convinced you violated your oath. In addition to violating the law, you violated
your oath,” ‘The Court went on to explain. that the public relies on medical professionals to

appropriately prescribe drugs because lay people, especially those with an addiction problem, do
not know and have no way of knowing which drugs are appropriate to be taking. In prescribing
drugs outside of the standards of the medical profession, Dr. Burke’s criminal conduct showed
such disregard for social norms and the ethical standards of the medical profession that he
undermined the public’s confidence in the profession. See Stidwell, 144 Md. App. at 619 (a
criminal offense that undermines the public’s confidence in a profession may be a crime of moral
turpitude if so determined by the appropriate licensing board). In the Panel’s view, based on the
facts of this case, Dr, Burke acted “contrary to the accepted and customary rule of right and
duty” that he owes to his fellow citizens in the State of Maryland and, as such, his convictions
constituted crimes involving moral turpitude. Walman, 280 Md. at 459,

Section 14-404(b)(2) Mandates Revocation of Dr. Burke’s Medical License

Second, Dr. Burke argues that there is no cited precedent for the summary revocation of
his license with no due process and no evidentiary hearing. Dr. Burke is incorrect, In enacting
Health Occ. § 14-404(b)(2), the Maryland General Assembly has authorized summary revocation
of a license for crimes involving moral turpitude. The Court of Appeals in Felsenberg
determined that “(t]he intent of the Legislature in directing summary treatment of a charge based
on the conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude is clear,” 351 Md, at 304.

In this case, the State appropriately initiated revocation procedures under Health Occ, §
14-404(b)(2). Unlike cases charged under Health Occ. § 14-404(a), where a licensee has the
right to an evidentiary hearing and the opportunity to appear at a DCCR for a settlement
conference, there is no statutory or regulatory right to a hearing for cases charged under Health
Occ. § 14-404(b), Rather, the decision to grant a hearing is discretionary based on the existence
of genuine issues of material fact or law as determined by the disciplinary panel. COMAR

10.32.02.07E(3). The Felsenberg Court explained, “when the charge rests solely upon the
conviction, there is no need to inquire into the underlying conduct” and that the question of
“Tw]hether the crime is one involving moral turpitude is an issue which ordinarily may be
resolved without the need for evidence or fact-finding.” 351 Md. at 303.

As noted in footnote 2, Dr, Burke was previously charged under Health Occ. § 14-404(a)
and received the opportunity to appear at a DCCR for a settlement conference in connection with
that case. The DCCR conference was originally scheduled for March 27, 2019. At Dr. Burke’s
request, the DCCR conference was postponed, and rescheduled to September 25, 2019. During
the pendency of the charges filed under Health Occ. § 14-404(a), the proceedings in this case
were initiated under Health Occ. § 14-404(b). Notwithstanding the pendency of the charges
under Health Occ, § 14-404(a), which were filed prior to Dr. Burke’s criminal conviction, the
Panel was authorized to initiate separate proceedings under Health Occ. § 14-404(b) after Dr.
Burke pled guilty and was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. See Felsenberg, 351
Mad. at 304 (“The fact that particular conduct is proscribed by two or more statutes does not mean
that there is a conflict between them; nor does it ordinarily preclude a prosecution under any one
of the statutes that applies, notwithstanding that the procedures or penalty applicable to that
statute are more onerous than under another applicable statute.”).

The Panel followed the appropriate process in statute and the Board’s regulations for
resolution of cases involving a crime of moral turpitude. In doing so, Dr. Burke was given the
opportunity to submit a written response to the Petition and to request a hearing limited to the
issues appropriately addressed in his written response. See COMAR 10.32.02.07E(2), (3). As
discussed above, the decision to grant a hearing is discretionary based on the existence of
genuine issues of material fact or law as determined by the disciplinary panel. See COMAR

10,32.02.07E(3). Dr. Burke did not request a hearing in accordance with COMAR
10,.32.02.07E(3). Instead, he sought to address the Panel regarding his case charged under
Health Occ. § 14-404(b) at the DCCR scheduled in connection with the charges issued under
Health Occ. § 14-404(a). To the extent that Dr. Burke’s request to address the Panel at the
DCCR can be interpreted as a request for a hearing in this case, Panel B denies the request. The
determination of whether the crime in this case involved moral turpitude is a question of law,
which does not require an evidentiary hearing or consideration of any facts beyond the elements
of the conviction itself.

Upon determining that a licensee has been convicted of a crime involving moral
turpitude, Health Occ. § 14-404(b)(2) requires a disciplinary panel to order the revocation of a
license after the completion of appellate proceedings. Dr. Burke cites three categories of cases
where a disciplinary panel issued orders of revocation in 2019 and argues that the facts in his
case warrant a lesser sanction when compared to other orders of revocation issued by a
disciplinary panel in the past year, In all three categories of cases cited by Dr. Burke, however,
the Respondent was charged and disciplined under Health Occ. § 14-404(a), and not under
Health Occ. § 14-404(b).° While in cases charged under Health Occ. § 14-404(a), the
disciplinary panel has the discretion to impose a sanction of a reprimand, probation, suspension,
or revocation, Health Occ. § 14-404(b)(2) requires a disciplinary panel to revoke the license of
an individual upon the completion of appellate proceedings if the disciplinary panel determines
that the licensee was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. The Panel rejects his

arguments.

Sin the third category, Dr, Burke cites a case where the Respondent was convicted of a crime involving moral
turpitude during the pendency of charges filed under Health Occ. § 14-404(a) and after the opportunity for a
settlement conference and hearing at the Office of the Administrative Hearings. Prior to the commencement of an
action filed under Health Occ. § 14-404(b), the Respondent agreed to enter into a Consent Order to resolve the
charges filed under Health Occ. § 14-404(a) with an 8-year revocation of his medical license. See Jn the Matter of
Atif B. Malik, M.D., Case Numbers 2218-0036B and 2219-0039A.
