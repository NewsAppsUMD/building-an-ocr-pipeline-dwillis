Dear Dr. Baltatzis and Counsel:

On September 29, 2017, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t II, § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014
Repl. Vol.). You were given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing before
Disciplinary Panel A to show cause why that suspension should not be continued on November
15, 2017. You attended the hearing on that date together with your counsel, Natalie McSherry,
Esq. The State was represented by Vicki Pepper, Assistant Attorney General, Administrative
Prosecutor. Both parties presented oral arguments at the show cause hearing.

After considering these arguments at the hearing and the investigative file, Disciplinary
Panel A determined that it would continue the summary suspension imposed on September 29,
2017. Disciplinary Panel A thus will not lift the summary suspension order. The arguments
submitted, when considered in the light of the investigative findings in the file, persuade
Disciplinary Panel A there exists a substantial risk of serious harm to the public health, safety or

welfare in your continued practice. Disciplinary Panel A, through its counsel, advised you of this
decision orally on the hearing date.

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, you have the right to request a full evidentiary hearing
before an Administrative Law Judge. This request will be granted if the Board receives a written
request for the hearing within TEN (10) days of the date of this letter. Any request for a hearing
should be sent to Christine Farrelly, Executive Director, at the Board’s address. If such a hearing
is requested, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set the hearing to begin
within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08 I, though that 30-day requirement may
be waived.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel A resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

incerely yours,

Christine A. Farrelly, |: utive Director

Maryland State Board of Physicians
