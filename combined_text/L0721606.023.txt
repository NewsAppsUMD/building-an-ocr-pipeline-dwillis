FINAL DECISION AND ORDER OF DEFAULT

Procedural History

On August 3, 2022, Disciplinary Panel B (“Panel B”) of the Maryland Board of Physicians

(the “Board”) charged the Respondent Netosha L. Wilson, RCP (the “Respondent”), with violating

the Maryland Respiratory Care Practitioners Act (the “Act”), Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. §§ 14-

5A-01 et seg. Specifically, the Respondent was charged under the following. provisions of the Act:

§ 14-5A-17. Denials, reprimands, suspensions, and revocations — In general.

(a) Subject to the hearing provisions of § 14-405 of this title, a disciplinary
panel, on the affirmative vote of a majority of a quorum of the disciplinary
panel, may deny a license to any applicant, reprimand any licensee, place
any licensee on probation, or suspend or revoke a license, if the applicant

or licensee:

(3) Is guilty of unprofessional or immoral conduct in the

practice of respiratory care [and]

(26) Fails to cooperate with a lawful investigation conducted
by the Board or a disciplinary panel[.]

On November 2, 2022, the Office of Administrative Hearings (“OAH”) mailed a notice of

remote scheduling conference (First Scheduling Conference) to the parties at the addresses of

record. The Respondent’s notice was sent to her Maryland address of record, as well as a

Mississippi address. The notice stated that the First Scheduling Conference would be held on the
Webex videoconferencing platform (Webex) on November 22, 2022, at 9:30 a.m. None of the
notices mailed by OAH to the parties were returned by the United States Postal Service (“USPS”),
and the Respondent did not request a postponement.

On November 22, 2022, the Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) convened the First
Scheduling Conference. The Administrative Prosecutor from the Office of the Attorney General
appeared and represented the State of Maryland. The Respondent did not appear. After waiting
over fifteen minutes for the Respondent or her representative to appear and having determined that
the Respondent received proper notice of the First Scheduling Conference, the ALJ went forward
in the Respondent’s absence. On November 30, 2022, the ALJ issued the First Scheduling Order,
scheduling a remote prehearing conference (“Prehearing Conference”) on Webex for 9:30 a.m., on
January 26, 2023; a remote merits hearing on Webex for 9:30 a.m., on February 23-24, 2023; and
discovery deadlines based, in part, on the first hearing date. Based on information obtained at the
First Scheduling Conference, the ALJ directed OAH to add a third mailing address for notice to
the Respondent (which was a second address in Mississippi). The First Scheduling Order sent to
the Respondent was not returned by USPS,

On November 30, 2022, OAH separately mailed notices for the Prehearing Conference and
the remote merits hearing to the parties, which also directed the parties to file prehearing
conference statements. The notice for the Prehearing Conference stated that failure to attend the
Prehearing Conference could result in a decision against the party failing to appear. None of the
notices mailed by OAH to the parties were returned by USPS, and there was no request for a
postponement of the Prehearing Conference. The State filed its prehearing. conference statement

on January 9, 2023. The Respondent did not file a prehearing conference statement.

Pursuant to § 14-408(a) of the Health Occupations Article, the Respondent has the right to
seek judicial review of this final decision and order. Any petition for judicial review must be filed
in court within 30 days from the date this final decision and order was sent to the Respondent. The
final decision and order was sent on the date that it was issued. The petition for judicial review
must be made as directed in the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act, Md. Code Ann., State
Gov’t § 10-222, and Maryland Rules 7-201 et seq.

david. wagner@maryland.gov The administrative prosecutors are not involved in the circuit court

process and does not need to be served or copied on pleadings filed in circuit court.

 

 
On January 26, 2023, the ALJ convened the Prehearing Conference, and the Administrative
Prosecutor appeared for the State. The Respondent did not appear. In assessing whether the
Respondent received proper notice of the Prehearing Conference, it was determined that the notice
of the Prehearing Conference was not sent to one of the Mississippi addresses and that the notice
sent to the other Mississippi address contained an incorrect zip code. Because the notices of the
Prehearing Conference were not sent to all of the Respondent’s known addresses, the ALJ
exercised his discretion to conduct a Second Scheduling Conference instead of the Prehearing
Conference. On February 1, 2022, the ALJ issued the Second Scheduling Order, scheduling a
Prehearing on Webex for 9:30 a.m., on February 23, 2023; a remote merits hearing on Webex for
9:30 a.m., on April 20-21, 2023; and discovery deadlines based, in part, on the first hearing date.

On January 26-27, 2023, OAH separately mailed notices for the Prehearing Conference
and the remote merits hearing to the Respondent. The notice for the Prehearing Conference stated
that failure to attend the Prehearing Conference could result in a decision against the party failing
to appear. The notices sent to one of the Mississippi addresses were returned by USPS with the
notation “no such street address.” The Second Scheduling order sent to this address was returned
by USPS for the same reason. None of the other notices mailed by OAH to the parties were
returned by the Postal Service, and there was no request for a postponement of the Prehearing
Conference. The Respondent has not updated her address with OAH or the Board.

On February 23, 2023, the ALJ convened the Prehearing Conference, and the
Administrative Prosecutor appeared for the State. The Respondent did not appear. After waiting
more than fifteen minutes, the ALJ commenced the Prehearing Conference. The ALJ reviewed
the record and determined that the Respondent received proper notice of the Prehearing

Conference. Based on the Respondent’s failure to appear, the State made an oral motion for the
entry of a default order against the Respondent and requested that the ALJ propose the revocation
of the Respondent’s licensure under the Maryland Respiratory Care Practitioners Act. Health Occ.
§ 14-5A-17(a)(3) and (26). The ALJ took the motion for entry of a default order against the
Respondent under advisement.

Under OAH’s Rules of Procedure, “[iJf, after receiving proper notice, a party fails to attend
or participate in a prehearing conference, hearing, or other stage of a proceeding, the judge may
proceed in that party’s absence or may, in accordance with the hearing authority delegated by the
agency, issue a final or proposed default order against the defaulting party.” COMAR
28.02.01.23A. Similarly, the Health Occupations Article provides, in pertinent part:

(d) If after due notice the individual against whom the action is

contemplated fails or refuses to appear, nevertheless the hearing officer

may hear and refer the matter to the Board or a disciplinary panel for

disposition.

(e) After performing any necessary hearing under this section, the hearing

officer shall refer proposed factual findings to the Board or a disciplinary

panel for the Board’s or disciplinary panel’s disposition.
Health Occ. § 14-405. Read in conjunction with the OAH Rules of Procedure, § 14-405(d), which
provides that the ALJ “may hear”! the matter if the individual fails to appear, and § 14-405(e),
which uses the language “any necessary hearing,” clearly contemplate situations such as defaults
where no hearing on the merits is required. (Italics added); see also COMAR 28.02.01.23A.

Upon consideration of the record, the ALJ found that the Respondent, who has not
appeared, attended, or participated in any proceedings related to the charges against her, had proper

notice of the February 23, 2023, Prehearing Conference and failed to appear in the Prehearing

Conference.

' The word “may” is generally considered to be permissive, as opposed to mandatory, language.

Accordingly, the ALJ issued a Proposed Default Order, proposing that the Respondent be
found in default in this case, the Board adopt as fact the statements set out in the Allegations of
Fact in the Charges under the Maryland Respiratory Care Practitioners Act, the Respondent be
found to have violated § 14-SA-17(a)(3) and (26), and the Respondent’s license to practice
respiratory care in Maryland be revoked.

Neither party filed exceptions to the ALJ’s Proposed Default Order.

investigation conducted by the Board or a disciplinary panel. |
