Case No.: 2223-0062A
License No.: D87559

Dear Dr. Farrag and Mr. Kao:

On March 28, 2023, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2) (2021 Repl.
Vol.). On April 12, 2023, Dr. Farrag was given an opportunity to attend: a post-deprivation
hearing before Disciplinary Panel A to show cause why that suspension should not be continued.
Dr. Farrag attended the hearing. The State was represented by K. F. Michael Kao, Assistant
Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor. Both parties presented oral arguments at the
post-deprivation hearing,

After consideration of the parties’ presentations, Disciplinary Panel A determined, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the health, safety, and welfare of the public imperatively
required the disciplinary panel to summarily suspend Dr. Farrag’s license and there exists a
substantial likelihood of risk of serious harm to the public health, safety, and welfare in Dr.
Farrag’s continued practice. Disciplinary Panel A thus will not lift the summary suspension

order, and the summary suspension imposed on March 28, 2023 is reaffirmed and continues in
effect. See COMAR 10,32.02.08H(1).

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, Dr. Farrag has the right to request a full evidentiary hearing
before an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Administrative Hearings. This request will
be granted if the Board receives a written request for the hearing within TEN (10) days of the
date of this letter. Any request for a hearing should be sent to Christine A. Farrelly, Executive
Director, Maryland Board of Physicians, 4201 Patterson Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland 21215. If
Dr. Farrag requests such a hearing, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set
the hearing to begin within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10,32.02.08I, though Dr. Farrag
may waive that 30-day requirement.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel A resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document. :

Sincerely yours,
