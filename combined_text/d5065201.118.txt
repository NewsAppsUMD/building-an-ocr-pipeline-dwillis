Re: Alberto R. Yataco, M.D.
Case No.: 2218-0123A
License No.: D50652

Dear Dr. Yataco, Mr. McDowell, and Ms. Brown:

On January 4, 2018, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued an
ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE in this case,
pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl. Vol.). On January 8, 2018, the
Disciplinary Panel A received a letter via facsimile from Dr. Yataco’s counsel, Mr. McDowell, informing
the Panel that Dr. Yataco did not intend to appear before the Board to contest the Board’s action entering its
Order for Summary Suspension of License to Practice Medicine. On January 10, 2018, Disciplinary Panel A
held an initial post-deprivation hearing, giving Dr. Yataco an opportunity to argue why the summary
suspension should not continue. Dr. Yataco and Mr. McDowell did not appear before the Panel. The State
was represented by Janet Klein Brown, Assistant Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor.

Disciplinary Panel A of the Board, having considered the investigative information in this case,
continues to believe that the public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires the summary suspension
of Dr. Yataco’s license within the meaning of Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2)(i). (2014 Repl.
Vol.).

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Dr. Yataco has the right to request a full evidentiary hearing before an Administrative Law Judge.
This request will be granted if the Board receives a written request for the hearing within ten days of the
date of this letter. The request for a hearing shall be sent to Christine Farrelly, Executive Director, at 4201
4201 Patterson Avenue — Baltimore, Maryland 21215
Toll Free 1-800-492-6836 — TTY/Maryland Relay Service 1-800-735-2258
Web Site: www.mbp.state.md.us
Patterson Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland 21215. If you request such a hearing the hearing will begin within
30 days of your request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08I, though you may waive that 30-day requirement.

This letter constitutes an order of Disciplinary Panel A resulting from formal disciplinary action and
is therefore a public document.

Sincerely yours,

~
