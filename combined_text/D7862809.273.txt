Case No.: 2224-0012
License No.: D78628

Dear Dr. Gucwa and Counsel:

On September 12, 2023, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2) (2022 Repl.
Vol.). Dr. Gucwa was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing on September
27, 2023, before Disciplinary Panel B, to show cause why that suspension should not be
continued. Prior to the scheduled hearing Dr. Gucwa’s counsel informed the Board that Dr.
Gucwa was waiving her right to the post-deprivation hearing. Due to the waiver, Panel B did not
hold a post-deprivation hearing in this matter, the summary suspension continues, and the parties
may proceed to the summary suspension appeal if Dr. Gucwa requests an evidentiary hearing as
referenced below. COMAR 10.32.02.08E.

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board’s regulations, Dr. Gucwa has the right to request a full evidentiary
hearing before an Administrative Law Judge. This request will be granted if the Board receives
a written request for a hearing within TEN (10) days of the date of this letter. Any request for.a
hearing should be sent to Christine A. Farrelly, Executive Director, at the Board’s address. If

such a hearing is requested, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set the
hearing to begin within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08 I, though that 30-day
requirement may be waived.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel B resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is, therefore a public document.

Sincerely,

Signature On File
