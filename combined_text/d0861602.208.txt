M.D. (the “Respondent”), License Number D08616. Disciplinary Panel B takes such action
pursuant to its authority under the Administrative Procedure Act (the “APA”), Md. Code Ann.,
State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2015 Supp.), concluding that the public health,

INVESTIGATIVE FINDINGS!

Based on information received by, and made known to Disciplinary Panel B of the Board,
and the investigatory information obtained by, received by and made known to and available to
Disciplinary B and the Office of the Attorney General, including the instances described below,
Disciplinary Panel B has reason to believe that the following facts are true:

1. At all relevant times, the Respondent was and is a physician licensed to practice medicine in

the State of Maryland. The Respondent was initially licensed in Maryland on September 18,

' The statements regarding the Respondent’s conduct are intended to provide the Respondent with notice of the basis
of the suspension. They are not intended as, and do not necessarily represent a complete description of the evidence,
either documentary or testimonial, to be offered against the Respondent in connection with this matter.
1970. His Maryland license is active through September 30, 2018.

. The Respondent is board-certified in psychiatry and neurology.

. The Respondent practices medicine at a private practice in Annapolis, Maryland.

. On September 8, 2016, the Board received a complaint from a former patient ("Patient A") of
the Respondent alleging that the Respondent routinely fell asleep and slurred his words
during her appointments. Patient A also alleged concerns regarding the Respondent's care
and billing practices.

. On September 16, 2016, the Board notified the Respondent of the complaint and its
preliminary investigation and requested a written response within 10 business days.

. By letter dated January 10, 2017, the Board notified the Respondent that it had opened a full
investigation.

. By letter dated December 15, 2017, the Board notified the Respondent that the Board
required him to attend an examination pursuant to Health Occ. II § 14-402(a), specifically a
neuropsychological examination.

. On January 3, 2018 and January 9, 2018, the Respondent underwent a neuropsychological
examination with a licensed psychologist (“Evaluator”), who is board-certified in clinical
neuropsychology.

. The Evaluator, in a written report dated January 20, 2018, concluded that the Respondent is
“unable to practice medicine competently and safely.” The Evaluator determined that based
on the results of the examination, the Respondent lacks the ability to “diagnose patients,

prescribe medication and engage in psychotherapy effectively.”
