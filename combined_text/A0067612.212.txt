Case No.: 2223-0022
License No.: A00676

Dear Ms. Ripple and Counsel:

On December 7, 2022, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF ATHLETIC TRAINER LICENSE in
this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2) (2021 Repl. Vol.). Ms. Ripple
was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing before Disciplinary Panel B to
show cause why that suspension should not be continued on December 21, 2022. Prior to the
scheduled hearing Ms. Ripple’s counsel, Mr. McGraw, contacted the Board and stated that Ms.
Ripple waived her right to the post-deprivation hearing. Due to the waiver, Panel B did not hold
a post-deprivation hearing in this matter, the summary suspension continues, and the parties may
proceed to the summary suspension appeal if Ms. Ripple requests an evidentiary hearing as
referenced below. COMAR 10.32.02.08E.

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

hearing before an Administrative Law Judge. This request will be granted if the Board receives
a written request for a hearing within TEN (10) days of the date of this letter. Any request for a

hearing should be sent to Christine A. Farrelly, Executive Director, at the Board’s address. If
such a hearing is requested, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set the

hearing to begin within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08 I, though that 30-day
requirement may be waived.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel B resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely,

Signature on F ile
