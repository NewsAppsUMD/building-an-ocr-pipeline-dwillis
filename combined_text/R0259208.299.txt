Re: Elizabeth Myers, Radiographer
Case No.: 2219-0195B
License No.: R0O2592

Dear Ms. Myers and Counsel,

On July 9, 2019, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued
an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
RADIOGRAPHY in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2). The
postdeprivation hearing was scheduled for July 17, 2019, before Panel B.

At the request of Myers, the post-deprivation hearing, scheduled for July 17, 2019, was
postponed. The hearing was rescheduled for August 28, 2019.

On August 28, 2019, Disciplinary Panel B held the post-deprivation hearing. Ms. Myers
appeared and was represented by Natasha Wesker, Esquire. The State was represented by
Christopher Anderson, Assistant Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor.

After consideration of the presentations of the parties, Disciplinary Panel B of the Board
determined that it would continue the summary suspension it imposed on July 9, 2019.
Disciplinary Panel B thus will not lift the order of summary suspension. Disciplinary Panel B

finds that the public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires the summary suspension of
Ms. Myers’s license to practice radiography. See State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2)(i). The order of
summary suspension is thus reaffirmed and continues in effect. See COMAR 10.32.02.08H(1).

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board's regulations, COMAR 10.32.02.08I - J, Ms. Myers has the right to
request a full evidentiary hearing before an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of
Administrative Hearings to contest the order for summary suspension. To receive the
evidentiary hearing, Ms. Myers or her counsel must file the request for the hearing within 10
days of the date of this letter. The request for the hearing shall be filed with Christine A.
Farrelly, Executive Director, Maryland Board of Physicians, 4201 Patterson Avenue, Fourth
Floor, Baltimore, Maryland 21215. If the hearing is timely requested, the hearing will be set
within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08I1, though the 30-day time period may be
waived.

This letter constitutes an order of Disciplinary Panel B resulting from a formal

disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely,

Signature on File
