Re: Haroon IJ. Hameed, M.D.
Case No.: 2221-0004B
License No.: D63269

Dear Dr. Hameed and Counsel:

On November 5, 2020, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl.
Vol. and 2019 Supp.). Dr. Hameed was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing
before Disciplinary Panel B on November 18, 2020, to show cause why that suspension should not
be continued. Dr. Hameed attended the hearing on that date together with his counsel, Natasha
Wesker, Esq. The State was represented by Michael Kao, Assistant Attorney General,
Administrative Prosecutor. The parties requested a continuance of the post-deprivation hearing to
December 16, 2020 and presented arguments in favor of the joint request. Disciplinary Panel B
considered the parties’ arguments and denied the request.

Through his counsel, Dr. Hameed thereafter informed the disciplinary panel that he elected
to waive the post-deprivation hearing and to proceed to an evidentiary hearing before an
Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Administrative Hearings. See COMAR 10.32.02.08I.
The regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set the hearing to begin within 30 days
of the request, though that 30-day requirement may be waived. Accordingly, the case has been
referred to the Office of Administrative Hearings.

Disciplinary Panel B also determined that it would continue the summary suspension
imposed on November 5, 2020. Disciplinary Panel B thus will not lift the order of summary
suspension, Disciplinary Panel B finds that the public health, safety, and welfare imperatively
requires the summary suspension of your license to practice medicine. See State Gov’t § 10-

226(c)(2)(i). The order of summary suspension is reaffirmed and continues in effect. See COMAR
10.32.02.08H(1).

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel B resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely yours,
