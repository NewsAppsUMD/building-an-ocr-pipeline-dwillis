On April 26, 2016, the Board sent an unexecuted copy of this Order of Suspension to the
Respondent’s last known address of record with the Board and also to the address on the request
form that the Board received from the Administration. Accompanying the unexecuted Order of
Suspension was a cover letter notifying the Respondent of his right to contest his identity in
writing within thirty days of the date of the letter and notifying the Respondent that if he did not
submit a signed, written appeal to the Board on or before May 26, 2016, the Board would
execute this Order of Suspension as written. The Respondent did not submit a written contest of
identity to the Board by May 26, 2016.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Board issued a license to practice respiratory care to the Respondent on

March 28, 1997. His license is currently active and is scheduled to expire on May 30, 2016.
2. On or about April 12, 2016, the Board received a written request from the
Administration, entitled “Request to Suspend or Deny License for Delinquent Child Support”
(the “Request”), which requested that the Board suspend the respiratory care license held by the
Respondent for delinquent child support under the authority of Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law § 10-
119.3. The Request stated that, as of April 1, 2016, the arrearage amount of child support that
the Respondent owed was $12,683.01, in the Administration’s case numbered 080092782.

3. As noted above, Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law § 10-119.3(e)(2) & (h)(1) requires
that the Board suspend the license of the Respondent upon notification by the Administration and
after sending written notice to the Respondent of the proposed suspension of his license and of
his right “to contest the identity of the individual whose license . . . is to be suspended.”

4. On April 26, 2016, the Board sent an unexecuted copy of this Order of
Suspension to the Respondent’s last known address registered with the Board (the same address
as that on the Request). Included with the unexecuted Order of Suspension was a letter notifying
the Respondent of his right to contest his identity, in writing to the Board, within thirty days of
the date of the letter; that is, to contest that he was not the Harr L. Marable, License No. L02620,
named by the Administration as the individual whose license should be suspended for delinquent
child support. In addition, the letter also gave Respondent written notice that if he did not submit
to the Board a signed, written appeal on or before May 26, 2016, the Board would execute this
Order of Suspension as written.’

5. The Respondent did not submit a written contest of identity to the Board by May

26, 2016, nor was the Board notified that the Respondent arranged to pay the arrears in full.

? The letter also notified the Respondent that he could prevent the suspension of his registration by contacting the
Administration and arranging to pay the arrears in full within 15 days of the date of the letter.
6. Having given the Respondent the statutorily required written notice of the Board’s
intent to suspend his license and of his right to contest identity pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Fam.
Law § 10-119.3(h)(1), and having not received a written response or appeal from the
Respondent, the Board is statutorily required to suspend the Respondent’s license, pursuant to
Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law § 10-119.3(e)(2).

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, the Board concludes that, pursuant to Md. Code
Ann., Fam. Law § 10-119.3(e)(2)(i), it is statutorily required to suspend the Respondent’s
license to practice respiratory care until the Board receives notification from the Administration
that the Respondent’s license should be reinstated pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law § 10-
119.3()(1)-(2), provided that the Respondent is otherwise qualified for a license.

ORDERED that the respiratory care license held by the Respondent, Harry L. Marable.,
License No. L02620, is SUSPENDED; and it is further,
