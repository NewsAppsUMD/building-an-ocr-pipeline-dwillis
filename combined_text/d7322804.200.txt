FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
INTRODUCTION

On April 11, 2019, Disciplinary Panel B (“Panel B”) of the Maryland State Board of
Physicians (“Board”) charged Roozbeh Badii, M.D. under the Maryland Medical Practice Act
with the following disciplinary grounds: Is professionally, physically, or mentally incompetent,
in violation of Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. (“Health Occ.”) § 14-404(a)(4); and Fails to
cooperate with a lawful investigation conducted by the Board or a disciplinary panel, in violation
of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(33). Dr. Badii requested an evidentiary hearing on the charges, On
June 3, 2019, the case was forwarded to the Office of Administrative Hearings (“OAH”) for an
evidentiary hearing on the charges.

A three-day hearing was held before an Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) at the OAH.
Both parties offered testimony from fact witnesses and from expert witnesses who testified
regarding Dr. Badii’s competency to practice medicine. On November 22, 2019, the ALJ issued
a proposed decision concluding that Dr. Badii failed to cooperate with the Board’s investigation,
in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(33). The ALJ did not uphold the charge that Dr. Badii
was professionally, physically, or mentally incompetent, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-

404(a)(4). The ALJ recommended that Dr. Badii’s license be suspended for a period not to
exceed one year, which could be reduced after the Board determined that Dr. Badii had fully
complied with the Board’s investigation.

On December 11, 2019, Dr. Badii filed exceptions to the ALJ’s proposed decision and
the State filed a response. The State filed exceptions to the ALJ’s proposed decision on
December 13, 2019. On February 12, 2020, both parties appeared before Disciplinary Panel A
(“Panel A” or “the Panel’) of the Board for an exceptions hearing.

FINDINGS OF FACT

Panel A adopts the ALJ’s joint stipulations of fact, numbers 1-18, and the ALJ’s
proposed findings of fact, numbers 1-50, and, numbers 54-59.! See ALJ proposed decision,
attached as Exhibit 1.2 These facts were proven by a preponderance of the evidence and are
incorporated by reference into the body of this document as if set forth in full. The Panel also
adopts the ALJ’s discussion set forth on pages 24-28 regarding the failure to cooperate charge,
which is incorporated into the body of this document as if set forth in full. The Panel does not
adopt the remaining findings of fact or the ALJ’s discussion on pages 28-34 regarding the
professional, physical, or mental incompetence charge.

Dr. Badii was licensed by the Board to practice medicine in the State of Maryland on
October 17, 2011. His license expired on September 30, 2018.7 In or around February 2018, the
Board initiated an investigation of Dr. Badii, under case number 2218-0147B, following a
complaint filed by a pharmacy benefit management organization regarding Dr. Badii’s

telemedicine prescribing practices. As part of this investigation into Dr. Badii’s prescribing

' The Panel does not adopt the last sentence of finding of fact 33.

? The ALJ proposed decision has been redacted to remove confidential information from public view.

> Pursuant to section 14-403 of the Health Occupations Article, the license of an individual regulated by the Board
may not “lapse by operation of law while the individual is under investigation or while charges are pending.” The
investigation in both cases began before the expiration of Dr. Badii’s license. Therefore, by operation of law, Dr.
Badii’s license did not expire during these proceedings.
therefore, the State contends that, contrary to the ALJ’s belief and the opinion of Dr. Badii’s
expert, there is no reliable evidence that Dr. Badii’s condition is being properly managed. The
State argues that the ALJ erroneously relied on Dr. Badii’s board-certification and unverified
patient surveys to conclude that Dr. Badii was competent to practice medicine.

The Panel owes no deference to the non-demeanor based credibility findings of the ALJ
and makes “its own decisions about bias, interest, credentials of expert witnesses, the logic and
persuasiveness of their testimony, and the weight to be given their opinions.” See State Bd. of
Physicians v. Bernstein, 167 Md. App. 714, 761 (2006). Both experts agree that Dr. Badii has a
medical condition and further agree that a medical condition in and of itself does not mean that
someone is incompetent to practice medicine and acknowledged that there are many physicians
who have mental conditions who are able to competently practice medicine. The relevant
consideration, however, is whether the physician has sufficient insight into the condition and is
aware of the symptoms, so that they are able to participate in treatment and ensure that the
condition is being appropriately managed and controlled.

The State’s expert opined that Dr. Badii demonstrated poor insight into his condition
while Dr. Badii’s expert opined that Dr. Badii reported being insightful into his condition. Dr.
Badii’s expert’s opinion and the ALJ’s proposed decision were based on assumptions that Dr.
Badii was being prescribed medication on a daily basis by his treating psychiatrist, that he had
been taking the medication regularly since 2017, and that he saw his psychiatrist on a regular
basis for pharmacologic management. Dr. Badii’s expert also relied on the statements made by
Dr. Badii that he recognized the need to take his medication on a regular, daily basis and agreed
to continue taking the medication for the foreseeable future. These assumptions were directly

contradicted by Dr. Badii in his own testimony. Dr. Badii explained that he has been taking two

11
medications off and on to treat his condition and that he decides whether to take one or both
medications based on his mood. Dr. Badii told his expert that his treating psychiatrist had been
prescribing one of the medications since 2017, but then stated during his testimony that he had
just informed his psychiatrist three or four months prior to the hearing that he was taking the
medication. Dr. Badii admitted that his treating psychiatrist had not prescribed the medication
and that he had ordered it on his own from overseas due to the cost. The Panel is unpersuaded by
the unsupported assumptions of Dr. Badii’s expert’s and the contradictory testimony of Dr. Badii
and does not defer to the ALJ’s findings on this issue.

Dr. Badii’s expert also explained that he considered the feedback from Dr. Badii’s
telemedicine patients and the interview with Dr. Badii’s girlfriend as a more reliable measure of
Dr. Badii’s temperament and professional competence in comparison to the objective
psychological tests. The Panel is similarly unpersuaded by this testimony and the basis for the
testimony. The fact that there have been no patient complaints against Dr. Badii made to the
Board is of little relevance to whether Dr. Badii is competent to practice medicine and does not
alter the potential for patient harm if Dr. Badii continues to practice medicine while his condition
is not under control. The Panel does not have to wait for patient harm to occur in order to act.
See Pickert v. Maryland Bd. of Physicians, 180 Md. App. 490, 505 (2008) (“No proof of injury
or harm is required to take disciplinary actions against a physician’s license.”). A Maryland
medical license allows an individual to practice in any specialty and the Board cannot control or
guarantee that Dr. Badii will continue to work in the telemedicine field in a low stress
environment where his interactions with patients are limited and his schedule is flexible where he

can choose not to work on days that he feels symptomatic. The Panel gives little weight to the
patient reviews and testimony of Dr. Badii’s girlfriend regarding Dr. Badii’s telemedicine
practice.

The Panel agrees with the testimony and conclusion of the State’s expert that Dr. Badii’s
insight into his condition is insufficient to ensure that his condition is being appropriately
monitored and he is getting appropriate treatment. Dr. Badii continues to dispute the diagnoses
of several medical professionals, has self-diagnosed himself based on his reluctant admittance to
any sort of condition, and has self-medicated by ordering medications from overseas that were
not prescribed by, monitored by, or disclosed to his current psychiatrist. The Panel, therefore,
does not adopt the ALJ’s findings that Dr. Badii has adequate insight into his condition and that
his condition is being appropriately managed and under control. After the considering the
entirety of the record, the Panel finds that the State has met its burden of proving that Dr. Badii is
mentally incompetent by a preponderance of the evidence. The State’s exceptions are granted, in
part.’

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Panel A concludes that Dr. Badii is professionally, physically, or mentally incompetent,
in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(4), and that Dr. Badii failed to cooperate with a lawful
investigation conducted by the Board or a disciplinary panel, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-

404(a)(33).

’ The Panel grants the State’s exception with regard to mental incompetence and finds that Dr. Badii is mentally
incompetent to practice medicine. The Panel, however, agrees with the ALJ that there is insufficient evidence in the
record to support a conclusion that Dr. Badii is professionally or physically incompetent to practice medicine. The
focus of the Board’s investigation and the State’s expert report was on whether Dr. Badii was mentally competent to
practice medicine. The State’s expert clarified that he was not asked to evaluate the quality of Dr. Badii’s care, but
rather whether Dr. Badii had any mental condition that would affect his ability to practice medicine safely.

13
SANCTION

The ALJ recommended that Dr. Badii’s license be suspended for a period not to exceed
one year, which could be reduced after the Board determined that Dr. Badii had fully complied
with the investigation. Dr. Badii argues that the sanction proposed by the ALJ is too harsh for,
what he describes as, a seven-day delay in providing the subpoenaed medical records. The State
argues that Dr. Badii’s license should be suspended for a minimum of one year and until he has
fully cooperated with the Board’s investigation.

As discussed above, Dr. Badii fails to appreciate that his actions have resulted in the
Board being unable to investigate a complaint alleging that Dr. Badii overprescribed high cost
drugs to telemedicine patients. In addition, the Panel has also found that Dr. Badii is
professionally, physically, or mentally incompetent, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(4).
Pursuant to the Board’s sanctioning guidelines, the minimum sanction for a violation of Health
Occ. § 14-404(a)(4) is suspension until competence is established to the Board’s satisfaction.
COMAR 10.32.02.10B(4). The Panel finds that a suspension for a minimum period of one year,
and until the Panel determines that it is safe for Dr. Badii to return to the practice of medicine,
with a referral to the Maryland Professional Rehabilitation Program is necessary.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE

‘On April 11, 2019,the Maryland Board of Physicians (Board) issued charges against

Roozbeth Badii,.M.D., (Respondent) based on alleged violations of the Maryland Medical

Practice Act. Mad. Code Anit.; Health. Oe. §§ 14-101 ef. seg. (2014 & Stipp. 2019).

Specifically, ‘the Resporideiit is charged with violating section 14-404(a)(4), being professionally,

physically, or mentally incompetent, and section 14-404(a)(33), failing to cooperate with a

lawful investigation conducted by the Board or-a disciplinary panel. A Disciplinary Conference

for Case Resolution in this matter resulted in no resolution of the case. Code of Maryland

Regulations (COMAR) 10,32,02.031(9)(). On June 3; 2019, the Respondent requested a

hearing in this matter, arid ‘on the sariie daté, the:Board ‘forwatdéd the case to the Office of

Administrative Hearings (OAH) fora hearing. The Board:delegated to the OAH the authority to

issue Proposed Findings of Fact, Proposed Conclusions of Law, and a Proposed Disposition.
practices, the Board issued a subpoena to Dr. Badii for the complete medical records of ten
patients and a subpoena to Dr. Badii to appear at the Board for an interview on July 12, 2018.
Dr. Badii failed to comply with either subpoena despite numerous requests for the information.*

During the course of the Board’s investigation of case number 2218-0147B, Dr. Badii
filed a complaint against another physician accusing the physician of a series of professional
improprieties.’ After investigating the complaint, the Board ultimately decided to close the case
with no action. Information submitted by Dr. Badii with his complaint raised concerns regarding
Dr. Badii’s ability to practice medicine safely and a new case was opened, under case number
2219-0026B, to investigate whether Dr. Badii was competent to practice medicine. The Board
subpoenaed Dr. Badii’s treatment records from the various physicians who had evaluated or
treated him over the years and sent Dr. Badii for an independent evaluation by a Board-certified
forensic psychiatrist to assess Dr. Badii’s competency. The psychiatrist reviewed all of the
evaluations and treatment records concerning Dr. Badii, as well as records from Dr. Badii’s
divorce proceeding and relevant portions of the Board’s investigative file, and concluded that Dr.
Badii was unable to safely practice medicine safely due to his anger, irritability, impulsivity,
poor insight and judgment.

EXCEPTIONS

Pursuant to the Board’s regulations, any party may file exceptions to an ALJ’s proposed
decision within 15 days ofits issuance. COMAR 10.32.02.05B(1)(a). The exceptions must be
related to the ALJ’s proposed decision and the disciplinary panel is not permitted to accept

additional evidence through the written exceptions process. COMAR 10.32.02.05B(1)(e). Both

‘The ALJ found that, as of the date of the OAH evidentiary hearing, Dr. Badii had still not appeared for the Board
interview or produced the records for nine out of the ten patients named in the subpoena.

> The details of the complaint and the identity of the physician who was the subject of the complaint are confidential
Board records and not subject to disclosure.

parties filed exceptions in this case. The Panel will address the exceptions related to the ALJ’s
proposed decision and the charges in this case below.
DISCUSSION

I. Failure to Cooperate

Dr. Badii takes exception to the ALJ’s conclusion that he failed to cooperate with the
Board’s investigation and disagrees with many of the ALJ’s proposed findings of fact related to
this charge. The Panel has carefully reviewed the ALJ’s proposed findings of fact regarding Dr.
Badii’s failure to cooperate and finds that each of the proposed findings of fact were established
in the record and supported by a preponderance of the evidence.

In connection with the complaint regarding Dr. Badii overprescribing prescription drugs
to his telemedicine patients, the Board sent Dr. Badii several letters and two subpoenas via first-
class mail to his address of record. The letters and subpoenas were not returned to the Board as
undelivered. When Dr. Badii did not respond to the initial communications sent to his address of
record, the compliance analyst sent an email to Dr. Badii, on April 30, 2018, and called Dr.
Badii, on May 15, 2018, using the email address and phone number that Dr. Badii provided to
the Board on his renewal application. The compliance analyst spoke to Dr. Badii on the phone,
on May 15, 2018, and Dr. Badii confirmed his email address and informed the compliance
analyst that his mailing address had changed and that the address he had provided to the Board
was no longer valid. The compliance analyst sent all of the prior communications that were sent
to Dr. Badii by first-class mail to Dr. Badii at the email address that Dr. Badii confirmed on the
phone and gave Dr. Badii until May 30, 2018 to comply with the first Board subpoena, which
requested the medical records of 10 named patients. Dr. Badii did not respond to the subpoena

for medical records by May 30, 2018. The compliance analyst followed up with phone calls to

PROPOSED FINDINGS OF FACT

 

Having. considered all of the-evidence presented, I find the following facts by a
preporiderance.of the evidence: °

1. Atall times-relevant to this proceeding, the Respondent was a licensed physician
in-the State of Maryland. until his licensed expired.on September 30, 2018. As of the date of the
hearing; the Respondent has not applied for reinstatement ofthis license to practice medicine in
Maryland. The Respondent is licensed to practice medicine ‘in other jurisdictions.

2. | The Respondent is certified by the Ameri¢an Board of Internal Médicirie‘in
internal medicine. On June 3,'2019, he was notified by the American Board of Internal Medicine
that he had paésed the. Spring. 2019 Intetnal Medicine Maintenance Certification Examination,

3. The Respondent practices medicine where he lives in southern California. He
primarily practices telemedicine and is-affiliated with several telemedicine providers,

4. When an initial application fora medical license'is received by the Board, the
applicant provides the Board with both a public and a non-public mailing address, The non-
public address is requested by the Board for its own use to communicate with the physician by
mail. In addition, the Board obtains an email address and a'telephone humber from the
applicant.

5. A licensed physician is required to-notify.the Board of a change of address within
sixty days ofthe change. Failureto do so.may result-in-an administrative penalty.

. 6. The Respondent renewed his Maryland license to practice medicine in 2016.-

7, When the Respondent renewed his license in Maryland in 2016, he provided the
_ Board with his non-public address of MMMM La Jolla, California 92037.

8. On January 5; 2018, the Executive Director of the Board sent a letter to the
Respondent at his non-public address; ‘The letter was not returned by the United States Postal

13
Service. Included in that letter was-a reference to the. requirement that a licensee must notify the
' .
Board of-any-change in address within ‘sixty days of the change.
|
9, On December 8, 2017, 4 complaint was received by the Maryland Department-of.

j

Maniigement and Budget from Ezz a provider-of prescription medicines, stating its

concer -that the Respondent may have been overprescribing topical.creams, ointments and other
high cost medications ns when compared | to his peers. The complaint was forwarded to the Board
and the matter was assigned to Molly Dicken for investigation.

10. Ms. Dicken; as was her typical ptactice, subpoenaed copies of documents from
Po provided its investigative file to Ms. Dicken.

11. On March 28, 2018, Ms. Dicken wrote a letter. to the Respondent at his non-public
address’of record, EE La Jolla, California 92037, informing the
Respondent of the pending, investigation involving his prescription practices and requested that
he resporid by providing complete medical records for ten Patients within ten business days from
March 28; 2018. The letter was sent first ¢lass.mail.. The practice of the Board is to ‘send
correspondence by first class‘mail rath than certified or + registered mail. The March 28, 2018
letter was not returned as undeliverable by the United States Postal Service.

12, Havingnot received the requested.information in’a timely manner and with no
confirmation that the Respondent recéived and read the March 28, 2018 letter, Ms. Dicken
yequested, by émail on April 30, 20 i8, that the Respondent confirm his email address so that she
‘could send documents to him by email The Respondent did not: respond to the email. The email

addréss was the'saine’email address tat the Respondent had provided to the Board when he

renewed his licénse in 2016. There wild fio-email received by” Ms. Dicken indicating that the
email-was not delivered.

14
13, Having not received ateply to her letter orher email, Ms. Dicken called the
Respondent on May 15, 2018 aiid-spoke to hint, He advised her that he had a new address,
Se San Diego, California 92122, Althougli this was a new address that
was not pteviously contained in the Board’s files, Ms, Dicken was unable to change the
Respondent’s non-public address on his license. The Board is only allowed to make the change *
following notification from the Licensee. Ms. Dicken informed the Respondent of this
requirement and urged him to notify the Board i in accordance with the applicable procedure..

14, One hour following'the phone call, Ms. Dicken sent the Respondent, by email, all
of the information sli previously sent by letter and email. She requested a response by May 30,
2018; however, shé did not receive-a response. She spoke with the Respondent again on June 7,
2018 and was,informed that he did not have medical records because of his inability to access
them as a telemedicine provider. He-did not maintain records. of his patients, but-was able to
obtain.the records of only.one of the-ten patients* medical records requested by the Board. Prior
to the June 7, 2018 conversation, the Respondent never informed.Ms. Dicken.or anyone else on
the Board that he had limited access to his patients’ records.

15. The Respondent was issued a subpoena on June it, 2018 to appear for an
interview with Molly Dicken on July. 12,2018, The:subpoena was mailed to the Respondent at
his-latest non-public address, as Diego, California 92122,

16, | The Respondent-never provided the documents.for the:nine other patients, nor did
he‘ever appear for an interview pursuant to.the June 11, 2018 subpoena. As of the-date of the
hearing, tlie Respondent has not‘appeared for the‘interview:and has not provided medical records
for nine ‘patients. :

17. On or.about July 9,.2018, the Respondent filed a complaint against Dr. ii
with the Board,” He-alleged violations of the Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act of

15
1
1996 GHIPPA) including slanderous and false statements Dr. HEEB made to Dr. a 2
psychologist, ‘in January: 2018. The Board opened an: investigation ‘into the Respondent’s
Complaint. : |

18. Based oi infomation conitainied in the Complaint: and the attachments to the

i
Complaint, which included. satements fom the-Respondent filed in an unrelated custody matter
stating that he-was unable ‘to work tet of a psychiatric ‘diagnosis and had undergone a court-
ordered psychiatric evaluation with a. PAD in January 2008, the Board opened on
its own volition, an investigation of the Respondent. The Board’s investigation did not arise
based on a complaint filed by an individual with the Board. At or about the same time, the
Board administratively closed the complaint filed by the Respondent against Dr a.

19. ° OnSeptember 6, 2018, Moly Dicken sent a letter to the Respondent informing
him that the Board had. opened 4 full investigation based upon information alleging that he may

patients named in the subpoena on June 7, 2018. On June 11, 2018, a subpoena ad testificandum
for Dr. Badii to appear at the Board for an interview on July 12, 2018 was mailed to Dr. Badii by
first-class mail at the new address of record that Dr. Badii provided to the Board. The subpoena
was not returned to the Board as undelivered. Dr. Badii did not appear for the interview on July
12, 2018 and has never made any attempts to belatedly comply with the Board’s subpoena.

Dr. Badii argues that he never received the Board subpoenas and argues that there was no
evidence that the Board subpoenas and other documents were mailed or delivered to him.
Licensees are required to update their addresses with the Board and have an obligation to
cooperate with the Board’s investigation. See Health Occ. § 14-316(f). Licensees who fail to
cooperate with the Board’s investigation are subject to discipline under the Medical Practice Act.
See Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(33). Dr. Badii acknowledged that he failed to update his address
with the Board and admitted that he only checked his mail once a month and that the post office
stopped delivering mail when his mailbox was full. Because of the requirement to update the
Board of their address and the importance of the Board being able to investigate complaints,
licensees cannot avoid discipline if they fail to update their address and thwart the Board’s
ability to investigate. See Maryland State Bd. of Nursing v. Sesay, 224 Md. App. 432, 453-54
(2015) (Ms. Sesay’s argument could provide an incentive to licensees in the midst of
administrative proceedings in which charges have been brought against them—or even before
any such proceedings commence if they believe charges may be brought—to fail to update their
address with the appropriate regulatory body.”).

Dr. Badii also argued in his exceptions that he never received phone calls from the Board

on May 15, 2018 and June 4, 2018 and accused the Board’s compliance analyst of lying about
responsibilities; he conducts quality control'reviews of physicians who work for the company.

The Merits of Board Case #2218-014 7B Failuré to cooperate with a lawful investigation
conducted by the Board or a disciplinary panelf:]

A physician licensed in the Stat of Maryland i is required to provide both a publica and
non-public mailing, address to the Board In addition to that: requirement, a licensed physician is
required to.notify the-Board of any change to his addresses within sixty days of the event.
Health Occ, §'14-316(6(1) (Supp. 2019).

Tn addition to the public and non-public mailing address, the Board requests a telephone
number and.a valid email address to assist: the Board ‘in communicating with the physician. At
the time of the Resporident’s renewal a his license, the Respondent provided Board with his
non-public address of a La Jolla, California 92037.

On January 5; 2018, the Executive Director of the. Board sent a letter to the Respondent: at
his listed nion-public-address. The ieter was not returned by the United’States Postal Service
(USPS) as undeliverable. Cortespondene from the Board is not sent by certified mail. ‘The
practice-of the Board is to send corresponderee by ordinary first’ class mail.

The origin of this case was a complaint received by the Maryland Department of
Management'and Budget (DBM) fo a prescription provider that contracts with the State to
provide prescription ‘coverage for State employees. ‘In the complaint, the:provider stated its

24

|
concer that the Respondent'may-have been overprescribing topical creams, ointments and other
. high cost medications when compared to his peers. The préscription provider included_a detailed
report documenting a comparison of the prescribing practices of the Respondent with his peers,
It also detailed:the cost of these prescribing practices on the State of Maryland and various
options the State may consider if it-determined that the Respondent's prescribing practices were
inappropriate, One of those options Was to refer the matter to the state medical board.

The matter was referred by DBM to the Board and the matter was assigned to Molly
Dicken, Compliance Analyst, to investigate this matter further on behalf of the Board. Ms.
Dicken issued-a subpoena to the prescription provider for its investigative file. The documents
were received by Ms. Dicken in response to the subpoena.

Following receipt and review ofthe documents, Ms, Dicken sent a letter on March 28,
2018 to the Respondent at his'listed non-public address, Eee La J olla,
California. In accordance with standard practice of the Board, the letter was serit by first class
mail, It was riot returned as undeliverable by the USPS, Ms. Dicken requested in her letter that
the Respoiident provide-récords of ten patients within ten business days of receipt of the letter.
Ms. Dickens did not receive a response to her letter.

Having notreceived a response, Ms. Dicken sent an email on April 30, 2018, to the
Respondent at the email address provided by him in his-application to renew his.medical license.
The-email was merely jnterided to ‘confirm the Respondent’s email address ’so that:she could.send
documents by email. She did not teceive an email in-resporise to her email, either fromm the
Respondeiit of ari‘émail from the Respondent’s email service provider indicating that the email
sent by’Ms. Dicken was returned as undeliverable,

Ms, Dicken followed-up her email with.a phone call to the Respondent on May 15, 2018,
which the Respondent answered and informed Ms. Dicken that the initial non-public address had

25
:

changed and was no longer: valid. Atthouh he provided Ms. Dicken with: ‘a new non-public
address, he was advised by her that he invst notify the Board of ‘the change and furthermore, she
could not change’ it herself. After ssa with the Respondent and informing: him that. he
would be sent:an-email, Ms. Dicken sent all of the information shé:previously sent to the
Resporiderit by eniail immediately fltowing the phone call.and requested that he respond by
May 30; 2018, Once again, he did not respond to Ms. Dicken’s request.

When she did not receive'a response as requested, Ms. Dicken called the Respondent on
June 7, 2018:to:inquire of the Respondent why he had not sent the requested information. The
Respondent advised Ms, Dicken that he hiad.only limited access to patient information due to the
fact that he was unable to access recor from teleriiedicine companies that he worked for that
have filed for bankruptcy: or otherwise | veased operations. He was only able to access one.
patient’s records out of the ten requ Ms. Dicken was not satisfied with his response.
Licensed physicians practicing tclemedicing are required to maintain documentation just like
physicians who practice in-peaot healt care settings. COMAR 10.32.05.06. Although the
Respondent was not charged in this case for any Violations of the Act relating to recordkeeping,
his inability to provide-the requested information limited the investigator’s ability to determine:
whether the complaint filed by the predotptoi provider has merit.

To obtain further information from the Respondent, a subpoena was issued on June il,
2018 for the Respondent to appear for: an. interview oni July 12, 2018. The: subpoena was sent to

his latest non-publie‘address and the wl was not returned by the USPS. The Respondent never

appearéd for the interview; 1 nor has the Respondent requested or suggested anew date for the

interview.
_ The Respondent acknowl that’ he failed to notify the Board of changes in his non-
public address. He-stated'during his testimony ‘that he did not’ goutinely check his mail atid that

i 6
the email sént by'Ms.:Dickén was delivered td his email spam: folder, whiclihe does not
routinely check. Only after speaking: with Ms. Dicken on the phone and learning that an email
was sent, did he discover the email in his spam folder.
The-Respondent claimed, during his testimony, that he never spoke:to Ms.:Dicken on

_ May 15, 201 8 and-accused her of lying about that phone call:. I am unpersuaded by the
Respondent's assertion. Ms, Dicken’s testimony was clear and concise and not evasive. She
was consistent in explaining all of her attempts to obtain the requested information on multiple
occasions. When the information was not forthcoming, she followed up with letters and emails.
The Respondent, on the other hand, was defensive and. could not explain why he has, to date, :
failed to submit to the.requested interview. The Respondent claims he maintains some records
and others he does.not maintain because they are held by the telemedicine companies. He also
stated that some-of the paper records were iri a house that he-did not have access to because of a
restraining order. However, he never told Ms. Dicken the reasons why he did not have access to
all the records. He claiiis that Ms. Dicken was lying about the May 15, 2018 phone call, yet he
has never filed a written response to the March 28, 2018 letter. I found the Respondent's
iéstimony on this point evasive and unpersuasive. He claims that he was prevented from
obtaining records due to a restraining order and.now the records are gone. He also testified that
the telemedicine companies have the patient records, yet he-was only able to. provide one record
when the-regulations:make it clear that he is required to: maintain records for all of-his:patients.
Although lie objects’ forthe charge of failing to coopetate with a lawful investigation of the Board
or disciplinaty pariel, his actions in. response to the inivestigaticn and his inconsistent testimony
clearly demonstrate a deliberate failure to cooperate. with the investigation. He stated during his:
testimony that he was willing to pay.a $100.00 penalty for not providing the Board with a-current
address within sixty days of a change, as required by section 14-316(£)(2), yet he fails to

27
understand that his failure to notify the’ Board of the address change is what-caused'an
unnecessary delay in the investigation into his prescribing practices. His failure to report the
change in address is sufficient alone'to cxtabli that he failed to cooperate with a lawful
investigation. While:the Respondent coninss his. failure to, cooperate with the lawful
investigation-by the: ‘Board, inchiding his failure to-even schedule an interview, which. was
requested in June 2018, nis preseibing practices continue, unabated, without the ability of the

_ Board to determine, whether his péescribing practices are ‘appropriate. I find his lack.of candor as
it relates to the storage of records and his access to them troubling, He is required to maintain
records regardless of whether he practices telemedicine or in-person medicine. The law provides

for no distinction, While he may not agree with the law, it is‘his responsibility to follow it,
unless ‘atid until it is chariged.

Finally, his accusation, without support, that Ms. Dicken did not tell the thith during het
testimony; is unfounded and uinsupported by the evidence. The Respondent’s failure to respond
to repeated requests from the Board’s Lompliance analyst, causing a delay in the investigation
that continues today, fully supports a finding that the Respondent failed to;comply with a lawful
investigation by-the Board ora disciplinary panel.

The Merits of. Board Case #221 9-0026B Is professionally, physically, or mentally incompetent;

This niatter originated with a complaint filed with the Board by the Respondent on July 9,
2018. The complaint was filed against Dr: P| the Respondent’s former eniployer. The’
Respondent worked for Dr = September'2013 through May 2015. The Respondent
accused Dr. Mf violating HIPAA by providing medical records to a court. without consent

Respondent was under investigation by the Board as a result of his prescribing practices. Ms.

involved in investigating the complaint filed by the Respondent.

The Respondent left the employ of Dy. Iles a result of a dispute involving the
treatment one of Dr: HEE patients, Prior to his separation from employment, Dr. mi
‘noticed that ‘the Respondent was sleeping ‘at the office anid not taking.care of his: ‘personal
hygiene. Additionally, Dr. Mc the Respondent were disappointed in not being awarded

thie hospitalist position of EMME Hospital. Dr. $HE promised the Respondent
that he would be the director if they were successful in their bid. The Respondent believed that
they lost the bid due to illegalities on the part of the Chief Medical Officer-for |

Attomey General and the Federal Trade Commission of his concems, Dr. Hibecame more
concemed. when the Respondent believed that the:mafia or the CIA was involved in the practice

When the Respondent left the practice aftet.a heated argument with orf the
treatment of'a patient, the relationship did not end. There were numérous text messages sent
between the two physicians indicating their dislike of each other. Following the end of their
communication, the Respondent suspected that Dr. bc filed the complaint-against him

testimony before the ALJ at OAH, where he admitted that he received a phone call from the
compliance analyst on June 4, 2018. Next, Dr. Badii points to a statement in the Report of
Investigation where the compliance analyst stated that the June 11, 2018 subpoena ad
testificandum was mailed and emailed to Dr. Badii and argues that this is evidence that the
compliance analyst lied because there was no evidence that the subpoena was ever emailed to
him. The compliance analyst was asked about this statement in her testimony and she corrected
the error in the report during her testimony and confirmed that the June 11, 2018 subpoena was
mailed by first-class mail to Dr. Badii at his address of record, but was not emailed to him. As a
result, the ALJ found that the Board mailed the subpoena to Dr. Badii, on June 11, 2018, and the
ALJ did not find that the subpoena was emailed to Dr. Badii on June 11, 2018. The Panel agrees
with the ALJ that a preponderance of evidence supports the finding that the June 11, 2018
subpoena was sent to Dr. Badii by first-class mail to his address of record and was not emailed to
him. The ALJ was unpersuaded by Dr. Badii’s assertions that the compliance analyst was lying,
and instead, found that the analyst’s testimony was clear, concise, and consistent in explaining
all her attempts to obtain the requested information from Dr. Badii on multiple occasions. The
Panel adopts the ALJ’s credibility determinations concerning the Board’s compliance analyst
and agrees that there is no credible evidence to support that she lied in her sworn testimony.

Dr. Badii argues that, assuming the truth of the compliance analyst’s statements, he
responded to the Board’s subpoena only 7 days late and argues that he should not be sanctioned
for his late compliance. Dr. Badii, however, fails to address that he only produced one of the ten
patient records requested and that he has never produced the remaining nine patient records in

compliance with the Board’s subpoena. Dr. Badii argued that he was not able to produce the

The Respondent ended his claonship with Dr. | very bad terms. They despised
each other as evidenced by tlie text messages sent to each other following the Resporident’s
separation froriiemployment. There wes even an-attempt. by Dr. | obtain.a restraising

to anger with others, ‘especially int the. context of the custody dispute, He has.sent many emails to
the Board, Dr. Ez. and Ms. Dicken, inquiring about the investigation, and requesting the
name of the person who allegedly filed a complaitit against him with the Board. There was an
abundance.of emails,.many of which were inappropriate and unjustified. He may not have a
pleasant demeanor, but that is not a criterion for determining whether he is mentally competent
to practice medicine. .

The Respondent recently passed his Internal Medicine Maintenance of Certification
Exaniination. He performed approximately 2000 telemedicine consultations between October
2017 and, January 2018. He returned to perfottning telemedicine consultations in December
2018-and continues today. He estimates that he has conducted 1,000 more consultations during
this period'and. has never received a complaint or been hainéd in’a medical malpractice lawsuit.

Both experts ‘detailed an extensive history af the Respondent, including his work history
as well-as his psychiatric history. His history was generally consistent with each expert, Where
they diverge involves haw they treated the Respondent's work history: Dr. I focused
on the-issues involving the Respondents practice with Dr. Bena how it deteriorated when
the Respondent began to sleep in-the office-and not practice appropriate hygiene. It is important
to note that the Respondent's working relationship with Dr. Beaded in 2015, Since then, Dr.
BEE focuses on'the Respondenit’s actions in court involving the custody dispute, He was
ordered to attend anger management training and be evaluated by Dr. | | This was an
extremely stressful period for the Respondent. Again, there was no consideration given by Dr.
P| as.to-the quality.of medical care provided by the Respondent. Dr. gM by
contrast, focused his:attention.on whether the Respondent, despite his mental illness, can
competently practice medicine. He'looked at patient reviews; he noted that there has never been
any patient complaints or medical malpractice Jawsuits filed against him. He'ldoked at awards
given to him for excellence and his recent Maintenance of Certification by the American Board
of Internal Medicine as evidence of his competency to practice internal medicine.

I gave more weight to the testimony of Dr. y= the testimony of pr: a.
‘The Respondents currently under-a doctor’s care, He is aware-of his mental illness even though
he may disagree with the diagnosis or the label applied. The diagnosis does not.matter as long as
the Respondent is mentally competent to practice medicine, He understarids that when his mood
chatiges, jie’will not take telemediaine Consultations during that period. He knows not to take
any risks when it cotnes to his patients, He knows that hé needs to contiiue to be under the care
ofa psychiatrist, His menial illness is being managed and there is no evidence that he-is putting -
his patients at risk because of his mental illness. The Board presented no evidence or allegations
that the Respondent is physically or professionally incompetent to practice medicine. The only

33
issite'is whether he is mentally incompetent to practice medicine. Havin g considered. the record
in its entiréty, I find that he is not mentally incompetent to practice, medicine.
Sanctions

As there is no violation of Health Occupations section 14-404(a)(4), no sanction appli es.
However, havirig found that the: Respondent did violate section 14-404(a)G), the. Board
recommended that the Respondent’s ligense to practice medicine be suspended for a period of
one year and he be required to comply with the Board’s original directives,

The Board is.Maryland’s “governmental agency responsible for investigating and
disciplining physicians for professional misconduct.” Cornfeld v. Board of. Physicians, 174 Md.
App. 456;.481 (2007). “The Board’s mission [is] to regulate the use of physician’s licenses in
Maryland in order to protect and presirve the public health.” Jd. at 481 (internal quotations and
citations omitted). The purpose of the Board’s disciplinary authority is to protect the public, not
to punish physicians, MeDonnell v. Comm. on Med. Disc., 301 Md. 426, 436 (1984).

COMAR 10.32.02. 10563) povides that the maximum sanction for a violation of 14-
404(a)(33) is-revocation. The minirmam sanction isa repriniand. Sanctions may also include:a
fine, which would range from $10, 000. 00 to $50,000.00, In this-case, the Board recommends
_ that the Respondent's license be suspended for a yeat and that he.comply with the Board’s
directives,

COMAR 10.32.09B provides: for the mitigating and aggravating factors to be considered
in recommending a sanction. In this case; there are few, if any, mitigating factors to consider for
the Respondenit’s failure:to cooperate ‘Wwithra lawful investigation. To this day, he has not
complied with the Board’s request for an interview and.has not fully explained why he was
unable to Provide the: requested information o on his patierits even though he is obligated and held

to the same standards of practice and documentation as those applicable ‘in in-person health care

| 34.
. settings. COMAR 10.32.05.06A; ‘There are no‘exceptions for licensees who practice
telemedicine: The Respondent’s failure to cooperate with the investigation demonstrates a lack
of good faith. Furthermore, I have previously determined that his misconduct was a. deliberate
attempt to impede the'lawfil investigation into his prescription-practices, The fact that the
Respondent deliberately failed to-comply with the lawful request fromthe Board’s investigator is
an aggravating factor.

The Board did not request that the Respondent be fined for his actions, even though a
minimum fine of $10,000.00 is included in the guidelines for this offense. I agree with the
Board’s recommendation and no fine should be imposed. While this is outside the range of
sanctions listed in the sanctioning guidelines, it is permissible to make this exception. COMAR
10:32,02.09A(8). The Respondent has demonstrated that he is currently experiencing financial
strain and a fine'would only add to his financial problems without providing an incentive for him
to comply with the investigation. It is important to note that the underlying complaint has yet to
be resolved. It is unknown, at this point, whether the Respondent’s prescribing practices are
appropriate or not. Therefore, the proposed sanction is not iritended to presume the outcdnie of
the investigation, but is intended to encourage the Respondent to cooperate with the Boaid’s
‘investigation. Therefore, I propose that the Board.suspend the Respondent’s license for a period
not to exceed one year, The suspension may.be less than a year provided the Board finds the
Respondent has fully cooperated with its investigation by complying with its requests to enable it
to complete its investigation into the Respondent’s prescribing practices, Whether any further
charges may be filed by the Board will depend on the outcome of its ‘investigation into the
Respondent's prescribing practices once he has fulfilled his obligation under. the proposed

disposition..

PROPOSED CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

 

Based oni the foregoing: Findings of Fact and Discussion, I conclude as.a matter of law
that the Respondent violated the Maryland Health Occupations Article Section14-404(a)(33)
(Supp..2019), I do not find that the Respondent violated section]4-404(a)(4). Asa result, I
conclude‘that the Respondent is subj to disciplinary sanctions.of a suspension. of his Maryland
license for a period not to exceed one year which may be reduced once the Board determines that
the he Respondent has. fully. complied wih its investigation: COMAR 10.32.02. 09.

PROPOSED DISPOSITION

I PROPOSE that chargés filed by the Maryland State Board of Physicians against the

Respondent on April 11, 2019'be upheld in part as to the Respondent's failure to cooperate with

a lawful investigation conducted by the Board and dismissed as to. the charge that the
| Respondent, is professionally, postal, or: mentally incompetent, and
. I PROPOSE that the Respondent ‘be sanctioned by imposing a suspension of his
Maryland license‘to practice rnedicine:for a-period not to exceed one year which may be reduced

once:tle Boatd determines that thé Respoiident has fully complied with its investigation.

records because the telemedicine companies maintained the records and he no longer had access
to the records or some of the companies were no longer in business. The ALJ found that Dr.
Badii was required to maintain his own patient records regardless of whether he practiced
telemedicine or saw patients in-person and did not find that Dr. Badii’s excuse that the
telemedicine companies maintained the records excused him from his independent responsibility
to keep patient records. In addition, Dr. Badii never responded to the Board’s June 11, 2018
subpoena, which required Dr. Badii to appear at the Board for an interview. The ALJ found that
Dr. Badii’s failure to respond to repeated requests from the Board’s compliance analyst
continued to delay the Board’s ability to investigate Dr. Badii’s prescribing practices and fully
supported a finding that Dr. Badii failed to comply with a lawful investigation by the Board or a
disciplinary panel. The Panel agrees. Dr. Badii’s exceptions are denied.

Il. Professional, Physical, or Mental Incompetence

During the Board’s investigation of Dr. Badii’s prescribing practices, Dr. Badii
submitted a complaint to the Board regarding another physician, which contained attachments
from a California court proceeding, including a financial statement in which Dr. Badii reported a
lower income due to a medical diagnosis and inability to work as a physician. As a result of the
information provided to the Board in the complaint, the Board initiated an investigation to
determine whether Dr, Badii was competent to practice medicine and referred Dr. Badii for an
independent evaluation, which revealed that Dr. Badii was not competent to safely practice
medicine due to his. anger, irritability, impulsivity, poor insight and judgment.®

The evidence showed that Dr. Badii has been evaluated by several medical professionals
over the course of his medical career with different focuses and reasons for the evaluations. Dr.

® The details of the evaluations, diagnoses, and specific medications are not disclosed in this document in order to
protect Dr. Badii’s private health information. ©
Badii has had several treating psychiatrists who evaluated Dr. Badii as a patient on a clinical
basis. Dr. Badii was ordered to undergo an evaluation as part of a child custody dispute in
California. Dr. Badii was ordered by the Board in this case to undergo an independent forensic
evaluation to determine whether he was competent to practice medicine and Dr. Badii hired his
own expert in this case to conduct an evaluation. There is a lack of consensus between the
medical professionals on a diagnosis, but Dr. Badii’s treatment history is largely undisputed.
Outside of the two evaluations conducted pursuant to this case, none of the other medical
professionals were specifically asked to evaluate whether Dr. Badii is competent to practice
medicine. The Panel gives little weight to the opinions and reports of the other medical
professionals who evaluated Dr. Badii in different contexts, who were not asked to opine on the
specific question at issue in this case, and who were not called as witnesses in this case.

At the OAH hearing, the State offered testimony from the independent evaluator who
conducted the evaluation of Dr. Badii as part of the Board’s investigation. Dr. Badii offered
testimony from the psychiatrist that he hired to conduct an evaluation of him. The ALJ accepted
both physicians as experts in forensic psychiatry and the evaluation reports of both experts were
admitted into evidence.

The State’s expert explained that a medical diagnosis in and of itself does not mean that
someone is incompetent to practice medicine and acknowledged that there are many physicians
who have mental conditions who are able to competently practice medicine. The individual,
however, must have insight into the condition in order to ensure the condition is being properly
monitored and they are getting the appropriate treatment. The State’s expert testified that Dr.
Badii exhibited poor judgment and insight into his condition, explaining that Dr. Badii believed

he was misdiagnosed, that the doctors who diagnosed him were wrong, and that Dr. Badii
contacted a prior psychiatrist in order to convince the psychiatrist to change his diagnosis. The
State’s expert concluded that given Dr. Badii’s anger, irritability, impulsivity, poor insight and
judgment, Dr. Badii was unable to safely practice medicine.

Dr. Badii’s expert, on the other hand, stated that, according to Dr. Badii’s reports, Dr.
Badii was insightful as to his condition and that Dr. Badii does not take telemedicine
consultations when he is symptomatic. Dr. Badii’s expert noted that Dr. Badii acknowledges he
has a condition, although he may disagree about the specific label, and that he has been
continuously taking his medications for a significant period of time, recognizes the need to take
the medication on a regular, daily basis and is agreeable to continuing to take the medication for
the foreseeable future. Dr. Badii’s expert administered psychological testing, which revealed
that Dr. Badii minimalized his faults, denied any problems, and was not very introspective or
insightful about his behavior. In addition, the psychological testing revealed that Dr. Badii is
likely to project an excessively positive self-image, externalize blame, see other people as being
responsible for his difficulties, and is unlikely to seek treatment or cooperate fully with treatment
if it is implemented. Dr. Badii’s expert, however, reviewed the patient comments and ratings
provided by Dr. Badii and opined that it was highly doubtful that Dr. Badii would have received
the positive feedback and performance ratings if his condition was impacting his ability to
practice medicine safely. The opinion of Dr. Badii’s expert, therefore, relied more on the patient
feedback selected and provided by Dr. Badii and an interview conducted with Dr. Badii’s
girlfriend than on the objective psychological testing. As a result, Dr. Badii’s expert concluded
that Dr. Badii did not display anger, irritability, impulsivity, poor insight and judgment that
would render him unable to safely practice medicine, and that Dr. Badii was not professionally,

physically, or mentally incompetent.
The ALJ compared the reports of the experts and noted that Dr. Badii’s history and
background was generally consistent in both reports. The difference, according to the ALJ, was
in how the experts viewed Dr. Badii’s work history and whether they considered the quality of
medical care provided by Dr. Badii in determining whether he was mentally competent to
practice medicine. In reaching the conclusion that Dr. Badii was not mentally incompetent to
practice medicine, the ALJ gave greater weight to the testimony of Dr. Badii’s expert than to the
testimony of the State’s expert. The ALJ pointed out that Dr. Badii’s expert considered patient
reviews provided by Dr. Badii, the lack of any patient complaints or malpractice lawsuits filed
against Dr. Badii, and interviewed Dr. Badii’s live in girlfriend, all of which the State’s expert
did not take into consideration in formulating his opinion. The ALJ found that Dr. Badii was
currently under the care of a psychiatrist and that Dr. Badii had insight into his condition and
recognized when he needed to take his medications and when he should not be treating patients
using telemedicine. The ALJ found that Dr. Badii’s condition was being managed and that there
was no evidence that he was putting his patients at risk and, therefore, concluded that Dr. Badii
was not mentally incompetent to practice medicine. The ALJ found that there was no evidence
presented or allegations that suggested Dr. Badii was professionally or physically incompetent to
practice medicine.

The State takes exception to the ALJ’s proposed finding that the charge of professional,
physical, or mental incompetence should be dismissed. The State argues that the ALJ’s
conclusions were based on unreliable evidence, such as online patient reviews, and testimony
from biased witnesses, such as Dr. Badii’s girlfriend and an expert that Dr. Badii paid to testify
on his behalf. The State points out that Dr. Badii has made different representations to different

professionals regarding the medications he is taking and his medication management and,
