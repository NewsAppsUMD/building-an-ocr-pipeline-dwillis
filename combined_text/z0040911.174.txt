On October 17, 2014, the Board sent an unexecuted copy of this Order of Suspension to
the Respondent’s last known address of record with the Board and also to the address on the
request form that the Board received from the Administration. Accompanying the unexecuted
Order of Suspension was a cover letter notifying the Respondent of his right to contest his
identity in writing within thirty days of the date of the letter and notifying the Respondent that if
he did not submit a signed, written appeal to the Board on or before November 16, 2014, the
Board would execute this Order of Suspension as written. The Respondent did not submit a
written contest of identity to the Board by November 16, 2014.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Board issued a license to practice polysomnography to the Respondent on

October 18, 2013. His license is currently active and is scheduled to expire on May 30, 2015.
2: On or about October 9, 2014, the Board received a written request from the
Administration, entitled “Request to Suspend or Deny License for Delinquent Child Support”
(the “Request”), which requested that the Board suspend the polysomnography license held by
the Respondent for delinquent child support under the authority of Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law §
10-119.3. The Request stated that, as of October 1, 2014, the arrearage amount of child support
that the Respondent owed was $9,820.52, in the Administration’s case numbered 700136591.

3: As noted above, Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law § 10-119.3(e)(2) & (h)(1) requires
that the Board suspend the license of the Respondent upon notification by the Administration and
after sending written notice to the Respondent of the proposed suspension of his license and of
his right “to contest the identity of the individual whose license . . . is to be suspended.”

4. On October 17, 2014, the Board sent an unexecuted copy of this Order of
Suspension to the Respondent’s last known address registered with the Board and also to the
address on the Request. Included with the unexecuted Order of Suspension was a letter notifying
the Respondent of his right to contest his identity, in writing to the Board, within thirty days of
the date of the letter; that is, to contest that he was not the Donald Busick Jr., License No.
Z00409, named by the Administration as the individual whose license should be suspended for
delinquent child support. In addition, the letter also gave Respondent written notice that if he did
not submit to the Board a signed, written appeal on or before November 16, 2014, the Board
would execute this Order of Suspension as written.”

5. The Respondent did not submit a written contest of identity to the Board by
November 16, 2014; nor was the Board notified that the Respondent arranged to pay the arrears
in full.

? The letter also notified the Respondent that he could prevent the suspension of his registration by contacting the
Administration and arranging to pay the arrears in full within 15 days of the date of the letter.
6. Having given the Respondent the statutorily required written notice of the Board’s
intent to suspend his license and of his right to contest identity pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Fam.
Law § 10-119.3(h)(1), and having not received a written response or appeal from the
Respondent, the Board is statutorily required to suspend the Respondent’s license, pursuant to
Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law § 10-119.3(e)(2).

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, the Board concludes that, pursuant to Md. Code
Ann., Fam. Law § 10-119.3(e)(2)(i), it is statutorily required to suspend the Respondent’s
license to practice polysomnography until the Board receives notification from the
Administration that the Respondent’s license should be reinstated pursuant to Md. Code Ann.,
Fam. Law § 10-119.3(k)(1)-(2), provided that the Respondent is otherwise qualified for a license.

Jr., License No. Z00409, is SUSPENDED; and it is further,
