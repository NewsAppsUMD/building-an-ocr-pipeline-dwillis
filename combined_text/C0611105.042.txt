Re: Permanent Surrender of License to Practice Medicine
Raelynn Torzone, PA-C, License Number: C06111
Case Number: 2222-0049B

Dear Dr. Freas and Members of Disciplinary Panel B,

Please be advised that, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. (“Health Occ.”)
§15-312 (2021 Repl. Vol.), I have decided to permanently SURRENDER ny license to
practice medicine in the State of Maryland, License Number C06111, effective
immediately. I understand that upon surrender of my license, I may not give medical
advice or treatment to any individual, with or without compensation, and cannot prescribe
medications or otherwise engage in the practice of medicine in the State of Maryland as it
is defined in the Maryland Physician Assistants Act (the “Act’), Health Occ. §§ 15-101 et
seq. and other applicable laws. In other words, as of the effective date of this Permanent
Letter of Surrender, I understand that the permanent surrender of my license means that I
am in the same position as an unlicensed individual in the State of Maryland.

I understand that this Permanent Letter of Surrender is aPUBLIC DOCUMENT,
and upon Disciplinary Panel B’s (“Panel B”) acceptance, becomes aFINAL ORDER of
Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”).

I acknowledge that the Board initiated an investigation of my practice and on
Apmil 6, 2022, Panel B issued disciplinary charges against me under Health Occ. §14-5F-
29(a) (unlicensed practice of naturopathic medicine), §14-5F-30(a)(1) (misrepresenting to
the public that an individual is licensed to practice naturopathic medicine), and §15-
314(a)(3)(ii) (unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine. A copy of the charges
is attached as Attachment 1. I have decided to permanently surrender my license to
practice medicine in the State of Maryland to avoid further investigation and prosecution
of these disciplinary charges.

I wish to make it clear that I have voluntarily, knowingly and freely chosen to
submit this Permanent Letter of Surrender to avoid further prosecution of the disciplinary
charges. I acknowledge that for all purposes related to physician assistant licensure in
Maryland, the charges will be treated as if proven.

I understand that by executing this Permanent Letter of Surrender I am waiving
my right to a hearing to contest the disciplinary charges. In waiving my right to contest
the charges, I am also waiving the right to be represented by counsel at the hearing, to
confront witnesses, to give testimony, to call witnesses on my own behalf, and all other

I understand that the Board will advise the Federation of State Medical Boards and
the National Practitioner Data Bank of this Permanent Letter of Surrender. I also
understand that in the event I would apply for licensure in any form in any other state or
jurisdiction that this Permanent Letter of Surrender may be released or published by the
Board to the same extent as a final order that would result from disciplinary action, pursuant
to Md. Code Ann., Gen. Prov. §§ 4-101 ef seq. (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2019 Supp.), and that
this Permanent Letter of Surrender constitutes a disciplinary action by Panel B.

| affirm that I will provide access to and copies of medical records to my patients
in compliance with Title 4, subtitle 3 of the Health General Article. I also agree to
surrender my Controlled Dangerous Substances Registration to the Office of Controlled
Substances Administration.

I further recognize and agree that by submitting this Permanent Letter of Surrender,
my license in Maryland will remain permanently surrendered. In other words, | agree that
I have no right to reapply and will not reapply for a license to practice as a physician
assistant in the State of Maryland.

I acknowledge that I may not rescind this Permanent Letter of Surrender in part or
in its entirety for any reason whatsoever. Finally, I wish to make clear that I have been
advised of my right to be represented by an attorney of my choice throughout proceedings
before Panel B, including the right to consult with an attorney prior to signing this
Permanent Letter of Surrender. I was represented by an attorney prior to signing this letter
permanently surrendering my license to practice medicine in Maryland. I understand both
the nature of Panel B’s actions and this Permanent Letter of Surrender fully. I acknowledge
that I understand and comprehend the language, meaning and terms and effect of this
Permanent Letter of Surrender. I make this decision knowingly and voluntarily.

Very truly yours,

~ Raelynn Torzone, PA-C

the evidence, either documentary o1 testimonial, to be, offered against the Respondent in connection with
these charges.

Page 2 of 11
BACKGROUND, COMPLAINT AND Prior DiscipLINARY ACTION
i At all relevant times, the Respondent was and is licensed to practice as a
physician assistant in the State of Maryland. The Respondent was originally licensed to
practice as a physician assistant in Maryland on March 21, 2016, under License Number

C06111. The Respondent’s physician assistant’s license is scheduled for renewal on June

30, 2023.

2. The Respondent has never been licensed to practice as a naturopathic
doctor by the Board.

3: In or around August 2020, the Board, while investigating a patient

complaint, reviewed a website (mynaturalbenefits.com) for Natural Benefits (“Natural
Benefits"), located in Annapolis, Maryland. The Natural Benefits website states that it is
a “Family Health and Wellness Center” and that the Respondent is its “Chief Nutrition
Officer.” The — states that it has daily office hours and allows clients to book
appointments online. The website states, “Let us Help you with” conditions including
digestive disorders, fatigue/anxiety, thyroid, allergy/desensitization, and ADHD.

4. The Respondent is prominently featured throughout the Natural Benefits
website, which includes an extensive testimonial narrative from her in which she
identified herself as a physician assistant and made observations about chronic health
conditions she had encountered in various clinical settings. The Respondent stated that
she and other staff practitioners at Natural Benefits provide services including the use of

“Natural Response Testing,” which purportedly “analyzes different areas on the surface

Page 3 of 11
of the body that relate to the state of health and to the flow of energy in each and every
organ and function of the body.” The Respondent stated that she and the practitioners at
Natural Benefits provide a “personal health improvement program.”

aM The website also published testimonials, purportedly from Natural Benefits
clients. The testimonials state that the Respondent treated conditions including high
blood pressure, acid reflux and suppressed immune systems.

6. The Respondent’s license to practice as a physician assistant would not
authorize her to perform the activities of a naturopathic doctor because there was no
Board-approved Delegation Agreement between her and a supervising physician at
Natural Benefits.

id After receiving the above complaint, the Board initiated an investigation of
the Respondent to determine if she was practicing medicine without a Board-approved
Delegation Agreement or if she was practicing another health care profession at Natural
Benefits without a license. Pursuant to its investigation, the Board, beginning on or
about August 14, 2020, issued a series of subpoenas, both to Natural Benefits and to the
Respondent directly, in which it sought appointment logs/patients/client listings of
clients/patients the Respondent treated, from June 1, 2020 to present. The Respondent
failed to comply with any of the subpoenas the Board issued.

8. The Board also directed the Respondent to provide a written response to the
above allegations and that in her response, she provide a detailed explanation of the

services she provides, including all components of “Nutrition Response Testing,

Page 4 of 11
90-minute comprehensive exam, including Heart Rate Variability test, Symptom Survey,
body scan and treatment protocol.” The Respondent failed to provide a written response
to the Board.

9. As a result, Panel B, on January 22, 2021, issued disciplinary charges
against the Respondent pursuant to the Maryland Physician Assistants Act. The
Respondent resolved Panel B’s charges by entering into a Consent Order, dated May 27,
2021, in which Panel B found as a matter of law that the Respondent violated the
following provisions of the Maryland Physician Assistants Act under Health Occ. §
15-314(a): (3) Is guilty of: (ii) Unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine; and
(33) Willfully fails to cooperate with a lawful investigation conducted by the Board or a
disciplinary panel.

10. Under the Consent Order, Panel B reprimanded the Respondent, placed her
on probation for a minimum period of one year, and directed that within ten days, she
comply in full with all previously issued written inquiries and Board investigative
subpoenas, including the subpoena duces tecum (“SDT”) it issued on September 24,
2020. Panel B also directed the Respondent to take and successfully complete a course in
professional ethics.

CURRENT Boarp INVESTIGATION
11. On or about April 28, 2021, the Board reissued its September 24, 2020,

SDT and again directed the Respondent to provide a written response regarding the

Page 5 of 11
services she provided at Natural Benefits. By email dated June 7, 2021, the Respondent
provided the responsive information.

12. Onor about June 7, 2021, the Board issued a SDT to the Respondent for six
patient records. On or about July 1, 2021, the Respondent provided the records to the
Board.

EXPERT REVIEW

13. On or about August 18, 2021, the Board submitted a copy of the
information Natural Benefits posted on its website, the Respondent’s written response to
the outstanding allegations, and the six patient records to a Maryland-licensed
naturopathic doctor who is an expert in naturopathic medicine (the “Expert”) for a
review.

14. The Expert issued a report dated October 17, 2021, concluding that the
Respondent practiced, attempted to practice, or offered to practice naturopathic medicine
without a license, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-SF-29(a). The Expert also determined
that the Respondent represented to the public by description of services, methods, and
procedures that she practiced naturopathic medicine, in violation of Health Occ. §
14-5F-30(a)(1).

tS. The Respondent inappropriately engaged in actions at Natural Benefits that
were consistent with the authorization provided to naturopathic doctors under the
following provisions of Health Occ. § 14-SF-14(a):

(1) Order and perform physical and laboratory examinations for
diagnostic purposes, including phlebotomy, clinical laboratory tests,
