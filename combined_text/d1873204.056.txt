RE: Permanent Surrender of License to Practice Medicine
Grace E. Ziem, M.D.

License Number: D18732

MBP Case Number: 2015-0695 B

Dear Dr. Gupta and Members of Disciplinary Panel B,

Please be advised that I have decided to PERMANENTLY SURRENDER my
license to practice medicine in the State of Maryland, License Number D18732, effective
immediately. I understand that upon the surrender of my license, I may not give medical
advice or treatment to any individual, with or without compensation, and cannot prescribe
medications or otherwise engage in the practice of medicine in the State of Maryland as it
is defined in the Maryland Medical Practice Act (the “Act”), Md. Code Ann., Health Occ.
I] (Health Occ. IT”), §§ 14-101 et seg. (2014 Repl. Vol. and 2015 Supp.) and other
applicable laws. In other words, as of the effective date of this Permanent Letter of
Surrender, I understand that the surrender of my license means that I am in the same
position as an unlicensed individual in the State of Maryland.

I understand that this Permanent Letter of Surrender is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT
and on Disciplinary Panel B’s (“Panel B”) acceptance, becomes a FINAL ORDER of
Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”).

I have decided to permanently surrender my license to practice medicine in the
State of Maryland to avoid further prosecution of the December 18, 2015 disciplinary
charges and the March 28, 2016 amended charges alleging that I violated Health Occ. II §
14-404(a)(3)(ii)(unprofessional conduct) and due to personal and medical issues which
have adversely affected my ability to practice medicine. A copy of the amended charges
is attached as Attachment 1.

I wish to make it clear that I have voluntarily, knowingly and freely chosen to
submit this Permanent Letter of Surrender to avoid prosecution of the aforementioned
disciplinary charges under the Act and in order to resolve this matter. I acknowledge that
if the case proceeded to a hearing, the State would be able to prove the charges by a

Lic. No. D18732

preponderance of the evidence. I acknowledge that for all purposes relevant to medical
licensure, the investigative allegations in the disciplinary charges will be treated as if
proven.

Prior to the issuance of the December 18, 2015 disciplinary charges, Panel B
summarily suspended my license to practice medicine in Maryland. | filed a timely
appeal. I understand that by executing this Permanent Letter of Surrender I am foregoing
the opportunity to continue my appeal of the summary suspension, which is now pending
at the Office of Administrative Hearings (“OAH”). I am also waiving my right to contest
the December 18, 2015 disciplinary charges and the amended charges at a formal
evidentiary hearing. In waiving my right to a formal evidentiary hearing, I am also
waiving the right to be represented by counsel at the hearing, to confront witnesses, to
give testimony, to call witnesses on my own behalf, and all other substantive and
procedural protections provided by law, including the right to appeal to a circuit court. I
do not wish to continue my appeal of the summary suspension or contest the disciplinary
charges.

I understand that the Board will advise the Federation of State Medical Boards,
the National Practitioners’ Data Bank, and the Healthcare Integrity and Protection
Databank of this Letter of Surrender, and in response to any inquiry, that I have
permanently surrendered my license in lieu of further disciplinary action under the Act. I
also understand that in the event I would apply for licensure in any form in any other
state or jurisdiction, that this Permanent Letter of Surrender may be released or published
by the Board to the same extent as a Final Order that would result from disciplinary
action, pursuant to Md. Code Ann. Gen. Pro. § 4-101 ef seg. (2014 and 2015 Supp.), and
that this Permanent Letter of Surrender shall constitute a disciplinary action by Panel B.

I affirm that as of the date of this Permanent Letter of Surrender, I will present to
the Board my original Maryland medical license, number D18732, and my most recent
wallet-sized renewal card. I will also provide my patients with access to and copies of
medical records, upon request, and I acknowledge that I have a continuing duty, on
proper request, to provide a patient's medical record to the patient, another physician or
hospital in accordance with Title 4, subtitle 3 of the Health General article.

I further recognize and agree that by tendering this Permanent Letter of Surrender,
my license in Maryland will remain permanently surrendered. In other words, I agree
that I have no right to reapply and will not reapply for a license to practice medicine in
the State of Maryland. I further acknowledge that the Board is not obligated to consider
any application for licensure or reinstatement that I might file at a future date and that I
waive any hearing rights regarding any such application.

AMENDED CHARGES UNDER THE MARYLAND MEDICAL PRACTICE ACT
a ER TE MARYLAND MEDICAL PRACTICE ACT

Disciplinary Panel B (“Panel B”) of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the
“Board”) hereby charges Grace Edith Ziem, M.D. (the “Respondent”), License Number
D18732, under the Maryland Medical Practice Act (the “Act”), Md. Code Ann., Health
Occ. Il (“Health Occ. tI”) §§ 14-101 et Seq. (2014 Repl. Vol.).

The pertinent provision of the Act under Health Occ. Il § 14-404 provides the
following: |

(a) Subject to the hearing provisions of § 14-405 of this subtitle, a

disciplinary panel, on the affirmative vote of a majority of the quorum
of the disciplinary panel, may reprimand any licensee, place any
licensee on probation, or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee:
(3) Is guilty of:
(ii) unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine;
The following provision of the American Medical Association Code of Medical
Ethics is pertinent in part to the charge of unprofessional conduct in the practice of
medicine:

Opinion 8.19 — Self-treatment or Treatment of Immediate Family Members (June
1993)

Physicians generally should not treat themselves or members of their immediate
families. Professional objectivity may be compromised when an immediate
family member or the physician is the patient; the physician’s personal feelings
may unduly influence his or her professional medical judgment, thereby

ATTACHMENT #1
 

interfering with the care being delivered. Physicians may fail to probe sensitive
areas when taking the medical history or may fail to perform intimate parts of the
physical examination...When treating themselves or immediate family members,

physicians may be inclined to treat problems that are beyond their expertise or
training.

...Concerns regarding patient autonomy and informed consent are also relevant
when physicians attempt to treat members of their immediate family. Family
members may be reluctant to state their preferences for another physician or
decline a recommendation for fear of offending the physician...

..Except in emergencies, it is not appropriate for physicians to write
prescriptions for controlled substances for themselves or immediate family
members. (I, Il, IV)
