ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE
TO PRACTICE MEDICINE

Disciplinary Panel B (“Panel B”) of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the
“Board”) hereby SUMMARILY SUSPENDS the license to practice medicine of

KRISHAN SINGAL, M.D. (the “Respondent”), License Number D36900, in the State

of Maryland.

Panel B takes such action pursuant to its authority under Md. Code Ann., State
Gov’t (“State Gov’t”) §10-266(c)(2) (2021 Repl. Vol.) and Md. Code Regs. (““COMAR”)
10.32.02.08B(7), concluding that the public health, safety, or welfare imperatively

requires emergency action.
INVESTIGATIVE FINDINGS

Based on information received by, and made known to Panel B, and the

investigatory information obtained by, received by, and made known to and available to
Panel B, including the instances described below, Panel B has reason to believe that the
following facts are true’:

Introduction

1. Panel B is summarily suspending the Respondent’s license to practice
medicine based on an evaluation that was ordered after Panel B issued a Final Decision
and Order, dated February 24, 2022, wherein Panel B found that he engaged in sexual
boundary violations with female subordinates. The evaluation determined that the
Respondent had little insight into his boundary violations and continued to be at risk for
' repeating the same unprofessional behaviors. Thus, the evaluators did not endorse the
Respondent to practice medicine and recommended that he attend an in-patient treatment
program. The Respondent failed to comply with the directives of the Maryland
Professional Rehabilitation Program (“MPRP”), in violation of the February 24, 2022
Final Decision and Order.

Background/Licensing Information

2. The Respondent was originally issued a license to practice medicine in
Maryland on June 17, 1988, under License Number D36900. The Respondent has
retained continuous licensure in Maryland since that date.

3. The Respondent is board-certified in Cardiology and Internal Medicine.

1 The statements regarding the Respondent’s conduct are intended to provide the Respondent with
reasonable notice of the basis of Panel B’s action. They are not intended as, and do not necessarily
represent a complete description of the evidence, either documentary or testimonial, to be offered against
the Respondent in connection with this matter.
4. Since in or around 2000, the Respondent has practiced medicine at offices
located in Glen Burnie and Pasadena, Maryland.

5. In May of 2009, the Respondent also entered into an agreement with a local
academic institution (the “College”) to become a preceptor with its Physician Assistant
Program.

Prior Disciplinary History

1994 Consent Order

6. On May 25, 1994, the Respondent entered into a Consent Order with the
Board in Case Number 93-0602 in which he admitted to having sexual contact with a
female employee on two separate occasions in 1992. He also admitted to having sexual
contact and sexual intercourse with another female who was also a patient.

7. Pursuant to the terms of the Consent Order, the Board suspended the
Respondent’s license to practice medicine in Maryland for a period of six (6) months and
placed him on probation for a period of three (3) years, subject to terms and conditions
including being evaluated by, and entering into treatment as directed with, a
Board-approved psychiatrist, and attending a Board-approved “mini residency” course in
medical ethics, focusing upon sexual misconduct.

8. The Respondent complied with the terms of probation after which the

Board terminated his probation on June 17, 1997.
2020 Final Decision and Order

9. On August 31, 2020, Disciplinary Panel A of the Board issued disciplinary
charges against the Respondent based on a complaint from an investigator at the College.
The complaint stated that a female physician assistant reported to the College that the
Respondent made sexually inappropriate statements to her while she was participating in

a clinical rotation at the Respondent’s office as part of her studies.

10. The Respondent requested a hearing on the charges before the Office of
Administrative Hearings, after which Panel B issued a Final Decision and Order on
February 24, 2022. In its Final Decision and Order, Panel B concluded that the
Respondent was guilty of unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation

of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ai).

11. Pursuant to the Final Decision and Order, Panel B reprimanded the
Respondent and placed him on probation for a minimum of two (2) years, subject to
terms and conditions including enrollment in MPRP and fully and timely complying with
its referrals, rules, and requirements, including, but not limited to, full participation and

compliance with all screening, evaluations, therapy and treatment as directed.

Failure to Comply with the Terms and Conditions of MPRP
12. The Respondent enrolled in MPRP on March 21, 2022 and entered into a

Participant Rehabilitation Agreement and Participant Rehabilitation Plan.
13. Following the Respondent’s initial consultation on March 21, 2022, MPRP
ordered the Respondent to undergo a complete, comprehensive, multi-day, independent
evaluation with a specialist in behavioral issues and unprofessional conduct. The
Respondent completed the evaluation on July 29, 2022.

14. The evaluation found that the Respondent denied wrongdoing in any of his
prior incidents and showed evidence of a “profound lack of understanding about his
behavior and sexual boundary violations.” The evaluation did not endorse the
Respondent’s practice of medicine and recommended that he should enter an in-patient
program for a more in-depth assessment of his professional boundary violations.”

15. OnSeptember 14, 2022, MPRP notified the Respondent of the results of the
evaluation and directed him to enroll in one of three MPRP-approved treatment programs
no later than September 16, 2022.

16. On September 23, 2022, the Respondent notified MPRP of his intention to
seek treatment at a non MPRP-approved facility, in non-compliance with MPRP’s
directive.

17. On September 23, 2022, MPRP again directed the Respondent to enroll in
one of the MPRP-approved programs by September 26, 2022, in order to continue his

participation in the program.

? For confidentiality reasons, the full contents of the evaluation are not set forth in this document. Panel B
was aware of the contents of the evaluation prior to issuing this Order for Summary Suspension.
18. The Respondent failed to enroll in an MPRP-approved program in
compliance with its directive, after which MPRP closed the Respondent’s case for cause
on September 27, 2022.
