FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On November 15, 2016, Charles J.N. Akoda, M.D., a physician licensed! by the
Maryland State Board of Physicians (“Board”), entered a plea of guilty to one count of Social
Security Account Number Fraud in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland
(U.S. District Court”), in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 408(a)(7)(B). (Case No. PWG-8-16-CR-
00277-001). On March 2, 2017, Dr. Akoda was sentenced to six months incarceration, three
years of supervised release, home detention for six months, and an assessment of $100.00. Dr.
Akoda has not filed an appeal of his conviction and the time for filing an appeal has passed.

On April 4, 2017, the Office of the Attorney General filed with the Board a Petition to
Revoke Dr. Akoda’s license to practice medicine, pursuant to section 14-404(b)(2) of the Health
Occupations Article, which provides:

After completion of the appellate process if the conviction has not been reversed

or the plea has not been set aside with respect to a crime involving moral

turpitude, a disciplinary panel shall order the revocation of a license on the
certification by the Office of the Attorney General.

' Dr. Akoda allowed his license to expire on September 30, 2016. The Board was notified of Dr. Akoda’s criminal
indictment in August of 2016 and began its investigation prior to the expiration of Dr. Akoda’s license. Pursuant to
Section 14-403 of the Health Occupations Article, the license of an individual regulated by the Board “may [not]
lapse by operation of law while the individual is under investigation . . .’ Md. Code. Ann., Health Occ. § 14-403(a)
(2014 Repl. Vol.). Therefore, by operation of law, Dr. Akoda’s license was not permitted to expire during the
pendency of these proceedings.
Attached to the Petition were certified copies of the criminal docket entries, indictment,
superseding indictment, plea agreement with stipulated facts, sentencing order, the judgment
entered, and a show cause order” mandating that Dr. Akoda show cause in writing by May 8,
2017 if there were any reason why his license to practice medicine should not be revoked. To

date, the Board has not received a response from Dr. Akoda.

Having reviewed and considered the entire record in these § 14-404(b)(2) proceedings,
Panel B issues this Final Decision and Order.
FINDINGS OF FACT
Panel B finds the following facts by a preponderance of the evidence:

1, Dr. Akoda was originally licensed to practice medicine in the State of Maryland on
September 14, 2011, having been issued License Number D73049. Dr. Akoda
continuously renewed his license until September 30, 2016 when his license expired.?

2. On June 1, 2016, in Case No. PWG-8-16-CR-00277-001, the United States Attorney filed
an indictment charging Dr. Akoda‘ with social security account number fraud, 42 U.S.C.
§ 408(a)(7)(B), and aggravated identity theft, 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(a)(1).

3. On October 19, 2016, in a superseding indictment, Dr. Akoda was charged with an
additional count of social security account number fraud, 42 U.S.C. § 408(a)(7)(B); false
statement relating to a health care matter, 18 U.S.C. § 1035(a); an additional count of
aggravated identity theft, 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(a)(1); and fraud and misuse of an
immigration document, 18 U.S.C. § 1546(a).

4. On November 15, 2016, Dr. Akoda pled guilty to social security account number fraud,
in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 408(a)(7)(B).° The plea agreement was based on the following
statement of facts, which Dr. Akoda acknowledged were true and correct:

? An updated show cause order was mailed to Dr. Akoda on April 6, 2017 with the same response date of May 8,
2017.

3 As discussed above, because of the Board’s continuing investigation of Dr. Akoda throughout these proceedings,
his license to practice medicine did not lapse or expire.

‘ The indictment included eleven different names for Dr. Akoda, including Charles John Nosa Akoda, the name
under which Dr. Akoda applied for and was granted a license by the Board.

5 42 U.S.C. § 408(a)(7)(B) provides: “Whoever . . . for the purpose of causing an increase in any payment authorized
under this title (or any other program financed in whole or in part from Federal funds), or for the purpose of causing
a payment under this title (or any such other program) to be made when no payment is authorized thereunder, or for
the purpose of obtaining (for himself or any other person) any payment or any other benefit to which he (or such
In October 1991, [Dr. Akoda] entered the United States pursuant to a
Nonimmigrant Visa.

In November 1991, [Dr. Akoda] applied for and obtained a Social Security
Number (“SSN”), XXX-XX-5054 (the “5054 SSN”), using the name “Igberase
Oluwafemi Charles” and date of birth April 17, 1962. In January 1995, [Dr.
Akoda] applied for and obtained a second SSN, XXX-XX-9065 (the “9065
SSN”), using the name “Charles Oluwafemi Igberase, Jr.” and a false date of
birth. In September 1998, [Dr. Akoda] this time using the name “Oluwafemi
Igberase,” and a false date of birth, applied for and obtained a third SSN, XXX-
XX-7353 (the “7353 SSN”). In or about 2011, [Dr. Akoda] fraudulently used the
7353 SSN to apply for federal education loans for his children.

In April 1992, [Dr. Akoda] submitted an application for certification by
the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (“ECFMG”). [Dr.
Akoda] submitted the application using the name “Oluwafemi Charles Igberase,”
and indicated SSN ending in 5054 SSN and date of birth April 17, 1962. ECFMG
is an organization which, among other things, provides certification to
international medical school graduates before such individuals may enter graduate
medical education programs in the United States, where they provide supervised
patient care. Foreign medical graduates must obtain ECFMG certification in order
to take the three-step United States Medical Licensing Examination (“USMLE”).
All medical graduates must pass all three steps of the USMLE in order to obtain
an unrestricted license to practice medicine in the United States. In July 1992,
[Dr. Akoda] failed both the basic medical science (Day 1) and clinical science
(Day 2) components of the Foreign Medical Graduate Examination in Medical
Sciences (“FMGEMS”), which is step 2 of the USMLE. Eventually, between July
1992 and September 1993, [Dr. Akoda] passed all three steps of the USMLE and,
in October 1993, was issued ECMFG Certification under the name “Oluwafemi
Charles Igberase.”

In March 1994, [Dr. Akoda] submitted a second application for ECFMG
certification, this time under the name “Igberase Oluwafemi Charles,” using a
false date of birth. Between August 1994 and September 1994, [Dr. Akoda]
passed all three steps of the USMLE and was issued a second ECMFG
Certification under the name “Igberase Oluwafemi Charles.”

In 1995, the ECFMG Committee on Medical Education Credentials
became aware that [Dr. Akoda] had fraudulently applied for and obtained two
ECFMG certifications under different names and dates of birth. In December

 

other person) is not entitled, or for the purpose of obtaining anything of value from any person, or for any other
purpose . . . with intent to deceive, falsely represents a number to be the social security account number assigned by
the Commissioner of Social Security to him or to another person, when in fact such number is not the social security
account number assigned by the Commissioner of Social Security to him or to such other person . . . shall be guilty
of a felony and upon conviction thereof shall be fined under title 18, United States Code, or imprisoned for not more
than five years, or both.”
1995, ECFMG revoked or suspended both ECFMG certifications assigned to [Dr.
Akoda].

In August 1996, [Dr. Akoda] submitted a third application for ECFMG
certification, this time using the name “John Nosa Akoda.” Along with this third
application, [Dr. Akoda] submitted to ECFMG a false Nigerian passport in the
name of “John Nosakhane Charles Akoda.” Between 1996 and 1998, [Dr.
Akoda], as “John Nosa Akoda,” passed all three steps of the USMLE and
received ECFMG certification under the “Akoda” name.

After receiving ECFMG certification under the “Akoda” name, [Dr.
Akoda] applied for and was accepted into a residency program at [Facility A].° In
2000, [Facility A] learned that the SSN that [Dr. Akoda] used belonged not to
“Akoda” but rather to Igberase. [Dr. Akoda] was suspended from [Facility A’s]
residency program in August 2000 and ultimately dismissed in November 2000.

In 1999, Individual A applied for and obtained SSN XXX-XX-1623 (the
“1623 SSN”).

In 2006, [Dr. Akoda], using the name “John-Charles Akoda,” and the
1623 SSN assigned to Individual A, applied for residency at [Facility B]. In
March 2007, [Facility B] accepted [Dr. Akoda] into its residency program, and
asked [Dr. Akoda] to submit evidence of legal residence in the United States. In
response, [Dr. Akoda] submitted a false permanent resident card in the name “N.
Akoda, John Charles.”

In 2011, after completion of his residency at [Facility B], [Dr. Akoda],
using the name “Charles John Nosa Akoda” and the 1623 SSN, applied for
medical licensure with the Maryland Board of Physicians. In support of this
application, [Dr. Akoda] submitted a false permanent residence card, as well as a
false Nigerian passport. In September 2011, the Maryland Board of Physicians
granted the requested medical license to [Dr. Akoda] under the name “Charles
John Nosa Akoda,” and [Dr. Akoda] began practicing medicine in the field of
obstetrics and gynecology.

In 2012, [Dr. Akoda], using the “Akoda” identity, sought and obtained
medical privileges at [Facility C] in Maryland. To do so, [Dr. Akoda] submitted a
false permanent residence card, as well as a false Maryland driver’s license.

On March 1, 2012, [Dr. Akoda] submitted a Medicare Enrollment
Application to the Center of Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS”) using the
“Akoda” identity and the 1623 SSN. CMS denied [Dr. Akoda]’s application
based, in part, on CMS’s determination that [Dr. Akoda] did not provide an
accurate SSN.

6 In order to maintain confidentiality, facility names will not be used in this Order.
On June 9, 2016, law enforcement executed search warrants at [Dr.
Akoda]’s residence, medical practice, and vehicle. From [Dr. Akoda]’s vehicle,
law enforcement seized a Maryland driver’s license in the “Akoda” name. From
[Dr. Akoda]’s residence, law enforcement seized (1) a false Social security card
for the 1623 SSN in the name “John Charles N. Akoda,” (2) a false Nigerian
passport for “Akoda,” and (3) a false United States visa in the “Akoda” name.
Law enforcement also found fraudulent or altered documents related to

immigration, medical diplomas, medical transcripts, letters of recommendation,
and birth certificates.

Throughout the above-referenced scheme, [Dr. Akoda] also used the 1623
SSN and false documentation to open various bank accounts using the “Akoda”
identity.

5. On March 2, 2017, Dr. Akoda was sentenced to six months incarceration, three years of
supervised release, home detention for six months, and an assessment of $100.00.

6. April 4, 2017, the Office of the Attorney General filed with the Board a Petition to
Revoke Dr. Akoda’s license to practice medicine pursuant to Health Occ. § 14-404(b)(2).

7. Dr. Akoda did not appeal his conviction within the time prescribed by law and the guilty
plea and conviction have not been set aside.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Dr. Akoda does not dispute that he pled guilty to a crime involving moral turpitude and
has not filed a response to the petition to revoke his license. Panel B makes the following
conclusions of law.

Dr. Akoda’s plea of guilty to social security account number fraud, a felony, in violation
of 42 U.S.C. § 408(a)(7)(B), constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude per se. The essential
elements of the crime include intent to deceive. Dr. Akoda admitted that he knowingly and
willfully falsely represented several different numbers to be the social security number assigned
to him with the intent to deceive.

Maryland appellate courts have repeatedly held that if dishonesty, fraud, or intent to
deceive is an essential element of a statute under which a defendant is convicted, the crime

involves moral turpitude as a matter of law. See Board of Physician Quality Assurance vy.
Felsenberg, 351 Md. 288, 295 (1998) (crimes involving fraud are crimes involving moral
turpitude); Attorney Grievance Comm’n v. Klauber, 289 Md. 446, 457-59, cert. denied, 451 U.S.
1018 (1981) (the term “moral turpitude” connotes a fraudulent or dishonest intent); Attorney
Grievance Comm’n v. Walman, 280 Md. 453, 459-60 (1977) (a crime of moral turpitude is
characterized by dishonesty, fraud, or deceit); Oltman v. Maryland State Bd. of Physicians, 162
Md. App. 453, 485-87, cert. denied, 389 Md. 125 (2005) (crime was one of moral turpitude
[because] it was dishonest, and characterized by fraud).

It is also settled that “the related group of offenses involving intentional dishonesty for
purposes of personal gain are crimes involving moral turpitude.” Oltman, 162 Md. App. at 486
(citations and quotation marks omitted). By using false social security numbers to open bank
accounts, apply for federal education loans for his children and obtain a medical license, Dr.
Akoda intended to defraud and deceive the government and Board for purposes of personal
financial gain to which he was not entitled. His conduct involved repeated fraud, deceit, and
intentional dishonesty for purposes of his own personal gain. The facts underlying Dr. Akoda’s
criminal offenses, therefore, also establish moral turpitude. Oltman, 162 Md. App. at 486.

‘In the instant case, Dr. Akoda was convicted of social security number fraud, in violation
of 42 U.S.C. § 408(a)(7)(B). Dr. Akoda was intentionally dishonest in committing an act of
willful deception on a massive scale for a prolonged duration of time for purposes of his own
personal financial gain. Panel B concludes that Dr. Akoda was convicted of a crime involving
moral turpitude and the time for filing an appeal has passed, thus the revocation of Dr. Akoda’s

license to practice medicine is required under Health Occ. § 14-404(b)(2).
ORDER
It is, on the affirmative vote of a majority of the quorum of Disciplinary Panel B, hereby
ORDERED that the medical license of Charles JIN. Akoda, M.D., license number
D73049, is REVOKED, as mandated by Health Occ. §14-404(b)(2); and it is further

ORDERED that this final decision and order is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT.
