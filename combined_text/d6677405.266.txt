Dear Dr. Williams and Counsel:

On May 18, 2016, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued
an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE
in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t II, § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl. Vol.). Dr.
Williams was given an opportunity to attend a hearing before Disciplinary Panel B to show cause
why that suspension should not be continued on May 25, 2016. Dr. Williams attended the
hearing on that date together with his counsel, Catherine W. Steiner, Esq. The State was
represented by Victoria Pepper, Assistant Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor. Both
parties presented extensive oral arguments at the post-deprivation hearing.

After considering these arguments at the hearing and the investigative file, Disciplinary
Panel B determined that it would continue the summary suspension imposed on May 18, 2016.
Disciplinary Panel B thus will not lift the summary suspension order. The arguments submitted,
together with Dr. Williams’ presentation and responses to the Panel’s questions, when
considered in the light of the investigative findings in the file, persuade Disciplinary Panel B
there exists a substantial risk of serious harm to the public health, safety or welfare in Dr.

Williams’ continued practice. Disciplinary Panel B, through its counsel, advised Dr. Williams of
this decision orally on the hearing date.

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, Dr. Williams has the right to request a full evidentiary
hearing before an Administrative Law Judge. This request will be granted if the Board receives
a written request for the hearing within ten days of the date of this letter. Any request for a
hearing should be sent to Christine Farrelly, Executive Director, at the Board’s address. If Dr.
Williams requests such a hearing, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set
the hearing to begin within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08 I, though Dr.
Williams may waive that 30-day requirement.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel B resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely yours,

   

Christine A. ena A cutive Director

Maryland State Board of Physicians
