Case No.: 2222-0081
License No.: RO9509

Dear Ms. Chastain and Counsel:

On March 8, 2022, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
RADIOGRAPHY in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2). On
March 23, 2022, Ms. Chastain was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing
before Disciplinary Panel B to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. On
March 14, 2022, Ms. Chastain, through counsel, requested a postponement of the March 23,
2022, hearing due to her counsel being unavailable to attend, which was denied. Ms. Chastain
did not appear at the hearing and no counsel appeared on her behalf. The State was represented
by Gregory Lockwood, Assistant Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor.

After consideration of presentation from the State, Disciplinary Panel B determined, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the health, safety, and welfare of the public imperatively
required the disciplinary panel to summarily suspend Ms. Chastain’s license and there exists a
substantial risk of serious harm to the public health, safety, and welfare in Ms. Chastain’s
continued practice. Disciplinary Panel B thus will not lift the summary suspension order, and the

summary suspension imposed on March 8, 2022, is reaffirmed and continues in effect. See
COMAR 10.32.02.08H(1).

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, Ms. Chastain has the right to request a full evidentiary
hearing before an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Administrative Hearings. This
request will be granted if the Board receives a written request for the hearing within TEN (10)
days of the date of this letter. Any request for a hearing should be sent to Christine A. Farrelly,
Executive Director, Maryland Board of Physicians, 4201 Patterson Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland
21215. If Ms. Chastain requests such a hearing, the regulations require that an Administrative
Law Judge set the hearing to begin within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08I,
though Ms. Chastain may waive that 30-day requirement,

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel B resulting from

formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely yours,
