ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION
OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE

OF LICENSE TO PRAC DER
Disciplinary Panel A (“Panel A”) of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the
“Board”) hereby SUMMARILY SUSPENDS the license of MAGANBHAI
PANSURIYA, M.D. (the “Respondent”), License Number D51705, to practice
medicine in the State of Maryland.
Panel A takes such action pursuant to its authority under Md. Code Ann., State
Gov’t § 10-226(c) (2021 Repl. Vol.), concluding that the public health, safety or welfare

imperatively requires emergency action.

I. BACKGROUND

 

Based on information received by, and made known to Panel A, and the
investigatory information obtained by, received by and made known to and available to
Panel A, including the instances described below, Panel A has reason to believe that the

following facts are true: '

ae

1 The statements regarding Panel A’s investigative findings are intended to provide the Respondent with
notice of the basis of the suspension. They are not intended as, and do not necessarily represent, a
complete description of the evidence, either documentary or testimonial, to be offered against the
Respondent in connection with this matter.
1. At all times relevant hereto, the Respondent was and is licensed to practice
medicine in the State of Maryland. The Respondent originally was licensed to practice
medicine in Maryland on February 28, 1997, under License Number D51705. The
Respondent’s license is current through September 30, 2023.

2. The Respondent is board-certified in internal medicine.

3. At all times relevant hereto, the Respondent owns and practices medicine at
a medical practice (the “Practice) that has offices in Carroll County, Maryland.

4. On January 16, 2018, Panel A issued the Respondent an Advisory Letter
based on an investigation into allegations that the Respondent had engaged in a sexual
relationship with a patient-employee. The Respondent denied that he had a sexual
relationship with the patient-employee, but described himself as a “friend and mentor” to
the patient-employee, and defined the relationship as “more than a doctor/patient
relationship.”

5. On March 3, 2021, in Case No. 2220-0100A, Panel A charged the
Respondent based on an investigation into allegations that the Respondent continued to
engage in an inappropriate sexual relationship with the patient-employee from the
previous investigation that resulted in the January 16, 2018 Advisory Letter. The
Respondent was charged with being guilty of immoral conduct in the practice of
medicine in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(), being guilty of unprofessional
conduct in the practice of medicine in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)Gi), and
engaging in sexual misconduct in violation of Health Occ. § 1-212 and COMAR

10.32.17.03.
6. On June 16, 2021, the Respondent entered into a Public Consent Order in
Case No. 2220-0100A that resolved the charges. The Consent Order contains Findings of
Fact and Conclusions of Law that the Respondent is guilty of immoral conduct in the
practice of medicine in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)@), is guilty of
unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine in violation of Health Occ. § 14-
404(a)(3)(ii), and engaged in sexual misconduct in violation of Health Oce. § 1-212 and
COMAR 10.32.17.03.

7. Through the Consent Order, Panel A ordered that the Respondent: be
reprimanded; be placed on probation for a minimum of two (2) years; be required to take
and complete a Panel-approved course in ethics with a focus on physician/patient
boundaries; be required to pay a $7,500 fine; and be required to enroll in and comply
with the Maryland Professional Rehabilitation Program (“MPRP”).

Il. MPRP PRELIMINARY EVALUATION

8. On August 4, 2021, the Respondent enrolled in MPRP and entered into a
Participant Rehabilitation Agreement and Participant Rehabilitation Plan.

9. On December 29, 2021, the Respondent met with a MPRP-affiliated
program for a preliminary evaluation. On January 4, 2022, MPRP provided the Board
with the results of the evaluation. The evaluator concluded that the Respondent is not “fit
to practice medicine with reasonable skill and safety at this time.” The evaluator had
“significant concerns” and concluded that the Respondent “demonstrated a lack of
understanding of foundational concepts regarding professional boundaries.” The

evaluator concluded that the Respondent “continues to demonstrate difficulty

3
acknowledging his problematic boundaries, examine problematic relational dynamics,
and identify appropriate professional boundaries.” The evaluator concluded “this leaves
both him and his patients significantly vulnerable to future boundary violations.”
Additionally, the evaluator opined that during a polygraph examination, the Respondent
“demonstrated significant reactions” to boundary questions and “his answers were
deemed untruthful.”

10. Accordingly, the evaluator concludes that based on the preliminary
evaluation, the Respondent “is not fit to practice with reasonable skill and safety” until
additional terms and conditions of the Participant Rehabilitation Agreement and
Participant Rehabilitation Plan are fulfilled.’

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

 

Based upon the foregoing, Panel A concludes as a matter of law that the public
health, safety, or welfare imperatively requires emergency action, pursuant to Md. Code
Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2) (2021 Repl. Vol.) and Md. Code Regs. (“COMAR”)
10.32.02.08B(7){a).
