FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

INTRODUCTION AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

 

Paula M. Nelson, M.D., (“Respondent” or “Dr. Nelson,”) a dermatologist, was
initially licensed to practice medicine in Maryland on March 14, 2011. Dr. Nelson’s
license expired on September 30, 2017.' In 2014, the Maryland State Board of
Physicians (the “Board”) received a complaint alleging that a physician assistant was
being improperly supervised and that Dr. Nelson and other providers were grossly
overutilizing dermatologic procedures. The Board opened an investigation. In 2016,
the Board received a second complaint from an anonymous “employee” alleging
substandard office conditions, an eviction notice, and that unauthorized practitioners
were performing procedures.

On January 12, 2017, Disciplinary Panel A ("Panel A”) of the Board filed charges
against Dr. Nelson alleging violations of § 14-404(a)(3)(ii) and (19) of the Health
Occupations Article for unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine and gross
overutilization of health services, respectively. The charges also alleged violations of

Health Occ. § 1-302(a)(1)-(3) and (d)(3) for prohibited referrals to a health care entity in

'A physician’s medical license does not lapse while the individual is under investigation or while charges
are pending. See Health Occ. § 14-403(a). Therefore, the Board maintains jurisdiction over Dr. Nelson's
license for the purpose of these proceedings.
which the practitioner or the practitioner's family owns a beneficial interest or has a
compensation arrangement. In addition, Panel A charged Dr. Nelson with failing to
disclose the existence of a beneficial interest in a health care entity, in violation of
Health Occ. § 1-303(a)-(b).

On February 7, 2017, Panel A delegated the charges to the Office of
Administrative Hearings (“OAH”) for an evidentiary hearing. On February 10, 2017, the
Board received an email from Michael Smith who stated that he was an attorney
licensed in Georgia who had been contacted by Dr. Nelson to represent her in this
matter. On behalf of Dr. Nelson, he asked the Board to rescind its delegation to OAH,
while he obtained admission in Maryland Pro Hac Vice. See Code of Maryland
Regulations (COMAR) 10.32.02.03F(1), Maryland Rule 19-214. The Board agreed to
Dr. Nelson’s request and rescinded the delegation to OAH.

On February 21, March 9, and March 30, 2017, the Board received three
separate additional complaints from three former patients alleging that they had been
unable to obtain their medical records from Dr. Nelson’s practice. The Board filed
amended charges on May 1, 2017, adding to the previous charges Health Occ. § 14-
404(a)(13) for failure to provide details of patients’ medical records to the patient and §
14-404(a)(33), for failure to cooperate with a lawful investigation conducted by the
Board or a disciplinary panel. Mr. Smith never obtained admission, Pro Hac Vice, and
did not appear before Panel A on behalf of Dr. Nelson. On May 11, 2017, Panel A
delegated the Amended Charges to OAH for an evidentiary hearing.

On May 17, 2017, OAH issued a notice of a scheduling conference for May 31,

2017, to Dr. Nelson’s address of record with the Board. The United States Postal
Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia, and Vermont. Her prior medical

licenses included Arizona, Delaware, Texas, and Minnesota.

3. The Respondent was board-certified in dermatology and dermatopathology
medicine.

of a pathology laboratory (“Laboratory A’) with her husband (a non-physician) located
in Atlanta, Georgia.
5. At all times relevant, the Respondent was the founder and principal owner ofa

dermatology and dermatopathology practice, (‘Practice A”) headquartered in Lilburn,

Georgia.
6. The Respondent’s husband, a non-physician, was the Manager of Practice A.

3 In order to maintain confidentiality, facility, patient and employee names are not used in this document.

4 The Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS’) filed suit against the Practice A in United
States ex rel. Ross v. Family Dermatology of Penn., P.C., No, 1:114-cv-2413 (N.D. Ga.); United States ex
rel. Baucom v. Family Dermatology of Penn., P.C., No. 1:11-cv-4260 (N.D. Ga.), and United States ex rel.
Milstein v. Family Dermatology, P.C., 1:13-ev-01027 (N.D. Ga.) alleging violations of the False Claims
Act. Sometime around April 2015 Practice A entered into a confidential settlement agreement with DHHS
as a resolution. On or about May 30, 2016, the Respondent was excluded from participation in Medicare
and Medicaid and all Federal Health Programs for breach of Practice A’s settlement agreement with
DHHS. Consequently, the Respondent closed several of Practice A’s locations.

and other providers were engaging in gross overutilization of dermatologic procedures.’

5 The Respondent continued to see patients at Locations A and B, and also saw patients at Location C.
® Each practice location was staffed by physician assistants and physicians.

’ The Respondent also named Physician A and Physician Assistant A in the complaint. The Board did
not find evidence to support improper supervision of Physician Assistant A or that there was adequate
evidence that Physician Assistant A violated the Physician Assistants Act.

as requested on September 11, 2015, for 9 of the 15 patients identified in | 16. She
stated that she had not “seen” the other 6 patients.

19. In furtherance of its investigation, Board staff transmitted medical and billing
records of 15 patients (identified below as Patients A through O) referenced in J] 14, and .
other relevant documents from the Board's investigative file to a physician board-
certified in dermatology (the “Expert”) for the purpose of conducting an independent
expert review. The Expert's opinions are set forth in pertinent part below.

Complaint #2 (MBP Case # 2017-0010)

20. On or about July 7, 2016, the Board received an anonymous complaint from an
“employee” alleging several potential violations including but not limited to receipt of an
eviction notice, substandard office conditions and that unauthorized practitioners had
been performing procedures.

® Board staff initially subpoenaed 44 patient records from Practice A from Locations A, B and C. Practice
A sent to the Board 43 records, and of those records, Board staff selected 15 for review.

13
241. On or about August 5, 2016, the Board notified the Respondent of the
anonymous complaint and requested a written response.

22. Onor about September 1, 2016, the Respondent submitted a written response to
the Board stating that Practice A had been investigated by the United States
Department of Justice (“DOJ”) for allegations of “engaging in improper financial

relationships with a number of its employed physicians.” She further stated in part:

The investigation culminated in the execution of an agreement with the DOJ,
effective April 21, 2015 to pay $3,247,835 plus interest at 2.375% annually, to be
paid in 7 installments over five years... The settlement was to ‘settle allegations
that [Practice A] violated the False Claims Acts [sic] by engaging in improper
financial relationships with a number of its employed physicians. The settlement
agreement is not an admission of liability.’

On May 18, 2016, the OIG? issued an exclusion letter excluding [Practice A] from
participation in federal programs... The OIG’s exclusion letter was issued as a
result of [Practice A] defaulting on its payment obligations pursuant to a
Settlement Agreement with DHHS, DOJ and OIG...
23. The Respondent denied the allegations of unauthorized practice, and stated that
“Due to cash flow issues...we issued a temporary suspension of operations letter to our
staff on August 1, 2016...”
24. The investigation of complaints 2015-0264A and 2017-00104 are set forth below.

61. Of the 47 specimens taken, only one biopsy specimen was obtained by the
Respondent (#28).'° All other biopsies documented were obtained by providers who
were either independent contractors'* or employees of Practice A.

62. Of the 47 specimens sent to Laboratory A, 15 of the specimens were reviewed
by the Respondent (## 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 24, 29, 36, 38, 41, 42, 46, and 47)."°

63. There was no informed consent or notification in the 15 patient records reviewed
notifying patients that the Respondent (as owner of Practice A) was also the owner of

Laboratory A.

Patient-related findings

Patient A

64. Patient A, a female in her 90s, was treated by Practice A in 2012, from
approximately March through December. Patient A was insured by Medicare and Blue
Cross Blue Shield.

65. On April 10, 2012, Patient A had an “excision” (removal) of a lesion on her cheek
performed by Physician A that was sent to Laboratory A for pathology review.‘

66. The pathologist, Physician D, determined that Patient A had basal cell carcinoma
67. Although Physician A performed an excision, he documented treatment of the

basal cell carcinoma with cryotherapy on both April 24, 2012 and June 5, 2012.

‘3 The Respondent was not the assigned pathologist on this specimen. Another pathologist employed by
Laboratory A, Physician C, conducted the review.

14 Reimbursed based on a percentage of billings.

15 There was no documentation in the patient records of these 15 patient specimens that the Respondent
had either obtained the specimens or that she had directly supervised the providers who had obtained the
specimens.

' Physician A billed it as an excision, which is intended as a removal of the lesion.

23
Treatment of the same lesion by excision and cryotherapy on two occasions within two
months is evidence of overutilization of treatment procedures.

68. |The Respondent was the principal owner of Practice A.

69. The Respondent, as owner of Practice A, received financial benefit from
Physician A’s overutilization and subsequent billing.

70. Practice A’s provider services to Patient A that were redundant or not clinically
appropriate constituted evidence of unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine
and the gross overutilization of health care services.

Patient B

71. Patient B, a male in his 70s, was treated by Practice A (Physician A) from
approximately October 2011 through April 2013. Patient B was insured by Medicare

record that he was treated for malignancies on those dates.

76. On January 9, 2013, Physician A conducted shave biopsies of lesions on Patient
B’s abdomen and right lower back, and referred the biopsies to Laboratory A for review.
The Respondent, the assigned pathologist, reviewed the lesions as basal cell
carcinoma. Practice A erroneously billed these shave biopsies conducted by Physician
Aas “excisions” instead of biopsies.

“superficial” basal cell carcinoma on Patient C’s lower back with cryosurgery. There was
no corresponding pathology report, or documentation that he had biopsied the site.

87. On November 5, 2012, Physician A documented he treated Patient C’s back and
mid-back with liquid nitrogen for basal cell carcinoma. There was no corresponding

of the scalp and skin of neck and skin of trunk; however, there was no corresponding
pathology report in her medical record. On this date, Practice A billed Patient D’s
insurance company for Physician A’s destruction of a malignancy for Patient D, but
there was no documented treatment in Patient D’s medical record. Physician A
documented that he treated Patient D for “actinic keratosis,” a benign condition, with
cryotherapy. Yet, Practice A billed Patient D’s insurance companies for Physician A’s
destruction of a malignancy

94. On November 13, 2012, Physician A “diagnosed” Patient D with squamous cell
carcinoma of her upper arm; however, there was no corresponding pathology report in

and squamous cell carcinoma with cryotherapy.

95. The Respondent was the principal owner of Practice A.

96. The Respondent, as owner of Practice A, received financial benefit from its
providers’ billing.

Patient |

30
notified the parties of the time and date of the July 17, 2017, In-Person Prehearing
Conference.

On July 11, 2017, Dr. Nelson filed a request to postpone the prehearing
conference, claiming that she had not been able to retain counsel due to financial
hardship. Dr. Nelson stated that she was working in Abu Dhabi and requested a
postponement until September 2017.

On July 12, 2017, the State filed an objection to Dr. Nelson’s postponement
request and argued that: the Board gave Dr. Nelson repeated opportunities to respond
to the charges and retain counsel; Dr. Nelson failed to file a timely prehearing
statement; Dr. Nelson had sufficient time to retain counsel; Dr. Nelson failed to respond
to the State’s May 18 discovery request; and that the charges are serious and involve
patient care.

The ALJ denied the postponement request, and the OAH Docket Specialist
notified Dr. Nelson by telephone that her request had been denied.

On July 17, 2017, Ms. Rubin appeared for the State at the prehearing
conference. Saul Jablon, Esquire, appeared for Dr. Nelson for the limited purpose of
requesting a postponement. Mr. Jablon stated that he was contacted by Mr. Smith, the
Georgia-licensed attorney, on July 13 or 14, 2017, and indicated that Mr. Smith was
planning to represent Dr. Nelson pro bono. Mr. Jablon stated that he agreed to
represent Dr. Nelson at OAH on July 17, and requested an extension of time for Mr.

Smith to be admitted Pro Hac Vice.

127. On or about March 6, 2012, Patient | was seen by Physician A for a skin check.
Physician A documented his assessment to include that Patient | had basal cell
carcinoma of the skin and squamous cell carcinoma of the upper limb. Above these
listed diagnoses, Physician A documented, “...examination of the all [sic] within normal
limits.” Physician A did not document that he had conducted biopsies on this date, or
that he had treated Patient I.

128. Practice A submitted an invoice to Medicare and Blue Cross Blue Shield for care
rendered by Physician A on March 6, 2012 (and received payment) for “destruction,
malignant, scalp, neck, hands, feet” and “destruction by any method, benign/
premalignant, 1st lesion.”

129. The Respondent was the principal owner of Practice A.

130. The Respondent, as owner of Practice A, received financial benefit from its
providers’ billing.

131. The Respondent was one of Patient I’s clinical providers.

January 2014 until July 2015.

136. On May 20, 2014, Physician Assistant A saw Patient L for biopsies of lesions of
his right cheek and scalp, and conducted excisions of both areas. The pathologist
documented “focal areas” of squamous cell carcinoma in situ.

137. On June 17, 2014, Patient L returned to see Physician Assistant A and she re-
treated the excisions of the cheek and scalp with liquid nitrogen.

138. The Respondent was the principal owner of Practice A.

139. The Respondent, as owner of Practice A, received financial benefit from its
providers’ billing, and Physician Assistant A was under her supervision.

140. The Respondent was one of Patient L’s clinical providers.

141. Practice A’s provider services to Patient L were redundant and/or not clinically
appropriate, and constituted evidence the Respondent engaged in unprofessional
conduct and gross overutilization of health care services.

Patient O

32
142. Patient O, a male in his 60s, was treated by Practice A from approximately
December 2011 through May 2015, at Locations B and C. Patient O was insured by
Medicare and Blue Cross Blue Shield.

143. Patient O was treated by providers including but not limited to the Respondent,
Physician Assistant A and Physician A, for lesions on his back, shoulder and arm. He
had a history of melanoma on his back from 1998, dysplastic nevus syndrome and
basal cell carcinoma.

144. On May 14, 2012, Patient O saw Physician A for a full body examination.
Physician A had seen Patient O previously at Practice A on December 5, 2011, for a full
body examination.

145. Practice A (for Physician A’s services) billed Patient O’s insurance company for a
new patient consultation (CPT code 99244) on May 14, 2012 despite having provided
the same service five months earlier.

446. On October 18, 2012, Patient O returned to see Physician A for a skin
examination. Physician A conducted two shave biopsies of lesions on Patient O’s upper
and lower mid back, and told Patient O to return to the office in three months. The
results showed both to be dysplastic nevi with atypia.

147. Practice A (for Physician A’s services) billed Patient O’s insurance company for
an excision for each (CPT code 11402), despite having documented that he had only
conducted shave biopsies.

148. On November 5, 2012, Patient O returned to Practice A and saw Physician A for
re-excision to remove the two dysplastic nevi. Physician A documented that he

conducted excisions of the two sites that he had biopsied on October 18.

33
149. The pathology report prepared for the specimens submitted from November 5,
2012 noted that the biopsy specimens were “re-shave[s]”,“° yet Practice A (for Physician
A's services) again billed CPT code 11402 for two excisions conducted on the same
sites documented on October 18.

150. A few months later, on May 7, 2013, Patient O saw Physician A for a skin check,
and Physician A again conducted a shave biopsy of the same lesion on Patient O’s right
lower back (biopsied on October 18 and November 6, 2012). Again, Practice A (for
Physician A’s services) billed Patient O’s insurance company for an excision of a benign
lesion (CPT code 11402) instead of a shave biopsy (CPT code 11302).

151. The Respondent was the reviewing pathologist for the May 7, 2013 shave biopsy
specimen, and diagnosed the lesion as severe dysplastic nevus, requiring “complete re-
excision.” She billed Patient O’s insurance company for surgical pathology, gross and
microscopic ($180) and immunohistochemistry ($370).

152. There was no documented justification in Patient O’s record for the Respondent
to conduct immunohistochemistry staining.

153. Approximately one month later, on June 20, 2013, Physician A conducted a “re-
excision” of a right lower back lesion, which showed the margins to be free of residual
melanocytic lesion. The Respondent was the reviewing pathologist.

154. The Respondent was the principal owner of Practice A.

155. The Respondent, as owner of Practice A, received financial benefit from its

providers’ billing.

20 Re-shaves should have been coded as CPT code 11302.

34
156. Practice A’s provider services to Patient O were redundant and/or not clinically
appropriate, and constituted evidence that the Respondent is guilty of unprofessional
conduct and gross overutilization of health care services.

MBP CASE ## 2017-0549A, 2017-0587A, and 2017-0653A

Q, and R constituted evidence that Respondent is guilty of failing to provide details of a
patient's medical record to patients.

173. Respondent's failure to respond to Board requests for a response to the
complaints for Patients P, Q, and R constituted evidence of a failure to cooperate with a

lawful investigation by the Board or disciplinary panel.

36
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Panel B adopts the ALJ’s proposed default order issued pursuant to COMAR
28.02.01.23A. Panel B thus finds Dr. Nelson in default based upon her failure to
participate at the Office of Administrative Hearings for the prehearing conference
scheduled for July 17, 2017. See State Gov't § 10-210(4).

Based upon the foregoing findings of fact, Panel B concludes as a matter of law
that Dr. Nelson is guilty of: unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine by
violating Health Occ. § 1-302(a) by referring, or directing its employees of or person
under contract with Practice A to refer pathology services to Laboratory A; and
assuming any of the referrals were exempted under Health Occ. § 1-302(d), Dr. Nelson
also failed to adequately disclose her beneficial interest in Laboratory A consistent with
Health Occ. § 1-303 to those patients referred. Dr. Nelson is also guilty of
unprofessional conduct, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii), and gross
overutilization of health care services, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(19), based
on Dr. Nelson's conduct as the clinical provider and owner of Practice A, as found, in
pertinent part, in the findings of fact J] 64 through 156.

Dr. Nelson failed to provide details of patients’ medical records to her patients, in
violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(13); and failed to cooperate with a lawful
investigation by the Board or disciplinary panel, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-
404(a)(33) as outlined in pertinent part in 9] 157 through 173.

SANCTION
Panel B adopts the sanction recommended by the ALJ, which is to revoke Dr.

Nelson’s license to practice medicine in Maryland.

37
ORDER
Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, it is, on the
affirmative vote of a majority of the quorum of Board Disciplinary Panel B, hereby
ORDERED that Paula Nelson, M.D.’s license to practice medicine in Maryland
(License Number D71962) is hereby REVOKED; and it is further

The State opposed the postponement request and moved for a default judgment.
Mr. Jablon opposed the motion for default. The State offered the exhibits it had planned
to offer into evidence and those exhibits were put into the file by the ALJ.

Under OAH’s rules of procedure, ‘[iJf, after receiving proper notice, a party fails to
attend or participate in a prehearing conference, hearing, or other stage of a
proceeding, the judge may proceed in that party's absence or may, in accordance with
the hearing authority delegated by the agency, issue a final or proposed default order
against the defaulting party.” COMAR 28.02.01.23A.

On July 18, 2017, the Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) granted the State’s
motion and issued a Proposed Default Order based on the OAH proceeding described
above. The ALJ proposed that the Panel:

41. Find the Respondent in default;

2. Adopt as fact the statements set out in the Allegations of Fact section of the
State’s Amended Charges;

3. Conclude as a matter of law that Dr. Nelson violated Health Occ. § 14-404(a)
(3)(i), (13), (19), (33) and Health Occ. § 1-302(a)(1)-(3) and (d)(3), and section 1-303
(a)-(b), in the manner set forth in the State’s Amended Charges; and

4. Revoke the Respondent's license to practice medicine.

According to OAH’s rules of procedure regulations “[a] proposed default order is
reviewable in accordance with the delegating agency’s regulations governing review of
proposed decisions.” COMAR 28.02.01.23C. On August 4, 2017, Dr. Nelson filed

exceptions, and an attorney, Jonathan Gladstone, appeared on her behalf at an
exceptions hearing held on October 25, 2017, before Disciplinary Panel B of the Board

(‘Panel B’).

RULING ON THE DEFAULT JUDGMENT

In her exceptions, Dr. Nelson argues that a default was inappropriate because,
under COMAR 28.02.01.23A and Health Occ. § 14-405, a disciplinary panel may issue
a default order if a party fails to attend or participate in a prehearing conference. Dr.
Nelson argued that she appeared and participated through her counsel Saul Jablon.
Dr. Nelson also argued that she was available to participate in the prehearing
conference via telephone. Dr. Nelson further argued that she gave the “timely, good
cause reason” of her absence from the country as the reason she was unable to
physically attend the prehearing conference and that her dire financial situation
prevented her from traveling to physically appear at the hearing and made it difficult to
retain counsel.

The State filed a response to Dr. Nelson’s exceptions. The State argued that
despite proper notice, Dr. Nelson failed to appear at the initial May 31, 2017, Scheduling
Conference; failed to comply with the State’s request for discovery; failed to file a
prehearing conference statement on June 30, 2017, in violation of the ALJ’s Scheduling
Order; failed to appear or participate at the prehearing conference; and failed to request
that she have the ability to appear telephonically. The State argued that Mr. Jablon,
who had been hired only two days before the prehearing conference, was present

merely to request the ALJ to reset the prehearing conference date and was not
prepared to address the issues in the prehearing conference instructions. Finally, the
State argued that Dr. Nelson has continued to request continuances and has delayed
Board proceedings, and has had ample time to prepare to defend the allegations in the
matter.

On June 1, 2017, Dr. Nelson was sent a “Notice of In-Person Prehearing
Conference” that advised Dr. Nelson of a prehearing conference on July 17, 2017. A
prehearing conference is to allow the parties to resolve matters prior to the hearing, and
ensure that the parties have the material necessary to prepare for the evidentiary
hearing. See generally COMAR 28.02.01.17. The notice to Dr. Nelson specified that
“Ti]f special accommodations are required, please notify this office at least five days prior
to the prehearing date.” Dr. Nelson never requested to appear telephonically or any
other accommodation. Enclosed with the notice were In-Person Prehearing Conference
instructions, which requested among other things: a statement of the issues presented,
a statement in support or in defense of the claim, a statement of facts expected to be in
dispute or undisputed, a witness list, copies of exhibits to be introduced, the name and
curriculum vitae of expert witnesses, a summary of the expert witness’s testimony,
prehearing motions and a statement of discovery disputes.

In a letter dated June 2, 2017, the ALJ reiterated to Dr. Nelson and the
administrative prosecutor for the State, that an In-Person Prehearing Conference was
scheduled for July 17, 2017. The ALJ highlighted that the parties were required to file
the above-described prehearing statements with OAH and to serve a copy on the
opposing party no later than June 30, 2017. The letter warned that “[flailure to file a

timely prehearing conference statement may result in a default being entered against a
party... . [and flailure to appear for the prehearing conference . . . may result in a
default order being entered.” Despite these warnings, Dr. Nelson failed to submit a
prehearing conference statement by the June 30" deadline. Dr. Nelson does not
contest that she was given proper notice of the prehearing conference or the
requirement to provide a prehearing conference statement by June 30, 2017. The State
filed a prehearing statement on June 27, 2017, setting forth the factual and legal issues,
an exhibit list, a witness list, an expert witness list, an expert curriculum vitae and report,
and a list of undisputed matters.

On July 17, 2017, Dr. Nelson appeared at the prehearing conference through
counsel, Saul Jablon. Mr. Jablon, however, did not meaningfully participate in the
conference. When asked to present, Mr. Jablon requested a postponement, which he
called “an extension of time” to allow Mr. Smith to be admitted to practice law in
Maryland. When asked to respond to the motion for a default judgment, Mr. Jablon
requested additional time to allow Mr. Smith to provide the discovery and other
information for the prehearing conference.

Contrary to Dr. Nelson’s argument to Panel B during the exceptions hearing, Mr.
Jablon was not prepared to proceed with the prehearing conference or to provide the
information required in the already overdue prehearing conference statement. Indeed,
Dr. Nelson had not provided a single response to discovery nor responded in any way
to the allegations in the charging document.

The Panel adopts the ALJ’s conclusion that “Mr. Jablon appeared at the
prehearing conference solely to request a postponement. He was not prepared to

address the issues set forth in the prehearing conference instructions issued by the
OAH. Therefore, the Respondent failed to attend or participate in the Prehearing
Conference.” ALJ Proposed Decision at 5-6.

Dr. Nelson argues that she could not appear because she was physically located
in Abu Dhabi and because she did not have the financial resources to travel or hire an
attorney. None of those reasons excuse the failure to meaningfully participate at the
prehearing conference. Neither excuse justifies her failure to provide basic information,
such as the statement of the issues, a statement of disputed and undisputed facts,
exhibits, or witnesses she intended to call in this complex case. Additionally, for the first
time in her exceptions, Dr. Nelson informs the Panel that she was available
telephonically on the date of the prehearing conference. There is simply nothing in the
record to support the suggestion that Dr. Nelson was ready and available to participate
telephonically. Dr. Nelson did not request from the ALJ prior to the prehearing
conference any accommodation to appear telephonically, nor did Mr. Jablon raise the
possibility of Dr. Nelson appearing telephonically to participate in the prehearing
conference. The Panel finds that Dr. Nelson did not participate in the prehearing
conference.

Dr. Nelson’s failure to participate in the prehearing conference was not a one-
time mistake. It is undisputed that Dr. Nelson failed to provided discovery to the State
pursuant to COMAR 140.32.02.04C(1) and (3). That includes both mandatory discovery
requirements as well as the State’s May 18, 2017, request for a list of witnesses to be
called, copies of documents to be produced at the hearing, the name and curriculum
vitae of any experts, and a copy of expert reports. It is also undisputed that Dr. Nelson

also declined to attend the scheduling conference where she was instructed to be ready
to discuss the requested and mandatory discovery, a list of witnesses to be called and
exhibits to be offered into evidence, discovery motions, stipulations or any dispositive
motions. Her only participation prior to the prehearing conference was a motion to
postpone six days prior to the prehearing conference.

Further, Dr. Nelson's request for a postponement to allow time for Mr. Smith to
be admitted in Maryland to represent Dr. Nelson fails as a valid excuse. Mr. Smith
originally sent an email to the Board seeking time to obtain temporary local admission
on February 10, 2017, over five months prior to the prehearing conference. The Panel
agrees with the ALJ’s statement that, prior to the request for postponement, Dr. Nelson
did nothing to “indicate that she seriously intends to appear and contest these charges
or participate in the hearing.” The Panel, therefore, upholds the ALu’s default judgment.

FINDINGS OF FACT
