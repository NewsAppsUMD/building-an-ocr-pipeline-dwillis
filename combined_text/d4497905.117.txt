Case No.: 7715-0064
License No.: D44979

Dear Dr. Wasson:

On April 25, 2017, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2). On May 10,
2017, Disciplinary Panel A held an initial post-deprivation hearing, giving you an opportunity to
argue why the summary suspension should not continue. You attended the hearing with counsel,
Curtis H. Booth, Esquire. The State was represented by Victoria H. Pepper, Assistant Attorney
General, Administrative Prosecutor. Both parties presented oral argument at the hearing.

After consideration of the presentations of the parties, Disciplinary Panel A of the Board
finds that the public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires the summary suspension of
your license. See State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2)(i). The order of summary suspension is thus
reaffirmed and continues. See COMAR 10.32.02.08H(1).

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

You have the opportunity to contest the order of summary suspension through a full
evidentiary hearing before an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Administrative
Hearings. To receive the evidentiary hearing, you must file your request for the hearing within
10 days of the date of this letter. The request for the hearing shall be filed with Christine
Farrelly, Executive Director, at 4201 Patterson Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland 21215. If the
hearing is timely requested, the hearing will be set within 30 days of your request, see COMAR
10.32.02.08], though you may waive the 30-day time period.
