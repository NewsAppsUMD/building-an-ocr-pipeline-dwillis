ORDER LIFTING SUSPENSION OF RADIOGRAPHER LICENSE

On September 20, 2018, the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”)
issued an Order of Suspension of Radiographer License for Delinquent Child Support
(“Order of Suspension”) against Yousef Degife (the “Respondent”). Pursuant to
Maryland Family Law Code Ann. (“Fam. Law”) § 10-119.3(e)(2)(i) (2006 Repl. Vol. and
2009 Supp.), upon request of the Montgomery County Office of Child Support
Enforcement Administration of the Maryland Department of Human Resources (the
“Administration”), the Board suspended Respondent's license to practice as a
radiographer in Maryland for Respondent's delinquent child support payments.

On March 11, 2023, the Board received a Notice to Reinstate Respondent's
license from the Administration. The Board took no action because the Respondent's
radiographer license had expired on April 30, 2019.

The Respondent applied for reinstatement of his radiographer license on
February 9, 2024. Pursuant to the Medical Practice Act, Maryland Health Occ. Code
Ann. §§ 14-101 et seq., Respondent otherwise qualifies for a license.

Therefore, pursuant to Fam. Law § 10-119.3(k), on this 4SF day of

M WA, Z , 2024, by the Maryland State Board of Physicians, it is hereby

ORDERED that the suspension of the Maryland radiographer license of Yousef

Degife is terminated as moot; and it is further
ORDERED that the Maryland radiographer license of Yousef Degife, is
REINSTATED without restrictions or conditions; and it is further

and, as such, is a Public Document and is reportable to any entity to which the Board is
obligated by law to report, and is disclosable under the Maryland Public Information Act,

Md. State Gov't Code Ann. §§ 10-611 et seg. (2009 Repl. Vol.).
