Dear Dr. Noar and Counsel:

On May 10, 2019, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued
an ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE in
this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2018
Supp.). Dr. Noar was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing before
Disciplinary Panel B to show cause why that suspension should not be continued on May 22,
2019. Dr. Noar appeared at the hearing with counsel, John Sly, Esq. The State was represented
by Janet Klein Brown, Administrative Prosecutor.

After considering the presentations of the parties at the hearing and the investigative file,
Disciplinary Panel B determined that it would continue the summary suspension imposed on
May 10, 2019. The order of summary suspension is thus reaffirmed and will continue. COMAR
10.32.02.08H(1). Disciplinary Panel B, through its counsel, advised the parties of this decision
orally on the hearing date.

hearing is requested, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set the hearing to
begin within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08 I, though that 30-day requirement
may be waived.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel B resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely yours,
