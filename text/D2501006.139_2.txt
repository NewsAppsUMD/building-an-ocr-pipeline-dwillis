On December 5, 2018, pursuant to Health Occ. § 14-402(a),! Panel A directed the
Respondent to a Board-approved program (the “Program”) for an evaluation.
During her evaluation, the Respondent signed a voluntary cessation of practice
agreement.

As a result of the Program’s evaluation, on January 17, 2019, the Respondent
underwent a psychiatric evaluation.

On January 17, 2019, the evaluating psychiatrist (“Evaluator”) issued his report of
the Respondent’s evaluation.

The Evaluator concluded that given the Respondent’s current clinical picture, she is
not presently in a state of health to practice medicine safely and effectively.
Effective January 29, 2019, Panel A summarily suspended the Respondent’s license
pursuant its authority under Md. Code. Ann, State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2) and Md.
Code Regs, 10.32.02.08B(7), concluding that the public health, safety or welfare
imperatively required emergency action.

In furtherance of its investigation of the November 2, 2018 complaint, the
Respondent’s medication profile was subpoenaed from a pharmacy for the period
from January 2017 through November 2018.

The medication profile revealed that the Respondent frequently prescribed to herself

a variety of medications, none of which were Controlled Dangerous Substances
