License No.: D26832

Dear Dr. Shaw-Taylor and Counsel:

On May 9, 2017, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued
an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE
in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2). On June 28, 2017,
Disciplinary Panel B held an initial postdeprivation hearing, giving you an opportunity to argue
why the summary suspension should not continue. You attended the hearing with counsel, Peter
T. McDowell, Esquire. The State was represented by Janet Klein Brown, Assistant Attorney
General, Administrative Prosecutor. Both parties presented oral argument at the hearing.

After consideration of the presentations of the parties, Disciplinary Panel B of the Board
finds that the public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires the summary suspension of
your license. See State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2)(i). The order of summary suspension is thus
reaffirmed and continues. See COMAR 10.32.02.08H(1).
