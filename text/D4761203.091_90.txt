Tt would seem the risk factors associated with poor healing and how to address them
would be a priori knowledge not requiring some lengthy empirical exploration. The Respondent
perhaps could have specifically targeted those at risk patients with Ethibond. That would be an
awful lot closer to innovation than the Respondent’s actual course of conduct.

Furthermore, the second surgery generates costs that are not present with the placement
of Vicry} or other absorbable sutures. The Respondent testified he picked ninety days as the
amount of time he left the Ethibond sutures in patients to ensure adequate healing. As indicated

in the chart above, the Respondent did not perform the second surgery on the suture patients until

global billing period for the hysterectomy procedure, Thus, because the Respondent performed
the second surgery beyond the ninety days, he could bill for the second surgery.

’ The Respondent provided no reason as to why he waited until after the ninety days to
perform the second surgery on the suture patients. He testified that sixty percent of all the
Ethibond patients had their surgeries beyond the ninety days. In his published JMIG article the -
Respondent writes that “it may be beneficial to delay Ethibond suture removal beyond 90 days,
as the three cases of spontaneous complete VCD in the Ethibond group occurred at postoperative
days 91, 101 and 104, However, the longer the suture stays in the body, the greater the risk of a
negative inflammatory reaction.” Resp. Ex. 39, at 4. Insurance paid the Respondent for the six
suture patients’ second surgery as follows:

Patient 1 - $0.00 (Bd. Ex. 9, at PM 3754)
Patient 2 - $0.00 (Bd. Ex. 12, atPM 3850)
Patient 4 - $247.54 (Bd. Ex. 18, at PM4109)

Patient 5 - $262.09 (Bd. Ex. 21, at PM 4197)
