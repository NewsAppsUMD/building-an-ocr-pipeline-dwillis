served as the Respondent’s supervising physician under a delegation agreement. As medical
director, Physician D works closely with Lay Person A.

Lay Person A oversees the three physician/primary care outpatient group practices associated
with the hospital and is responsible for hiring and firing physician assistants, among other
practitioners. The practices are located in three cities in Maryland, The Respondent initially
worked at one of the practices and then moved to another.

Physician A notified Hospital A he was leaving his employment there effective December
31,2014, Physician A’s departure conclusively ended his relationship with the Respondent
as her supervising physician under the delegation agreement filed with the Board, thus
bringing an end to their delegation agreement.

Sometime after December 2, 2014, the Respondent went to Nigeria for about four weeks.
The Respondent knew when she left for Nigeria that when she returned, Physician A would.
no longer serve as her supervising physician.

On December 2, 2014, the Respondent signed a delegation application to have Physician C
serve as her supervising physician, Physician C provides patient care and supervises
physician assistants under Hospital A’s hierarchy. On December 5, 2014, Physician C signed
and dated the delegation agreement. Physician C only expected to serve as the Respondent’s
supervising physician from January or February 2015 to June 2015.

The Respondent gave the application to an unspecified petson at Hospital A on the belief that
the hospital would send it to the Board with the required fee, but it did not do so. Neither the
Respondent nor anyone or her behalf filed the delegation agreement and associated fee with
the Board. The absence of any acceptance email or letter from the Board would have alerted
the Respondent to the strong possibility the delegation agreement had not been filed.
