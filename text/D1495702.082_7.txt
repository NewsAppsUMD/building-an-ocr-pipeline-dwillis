members went beyond the limited exceptions provided in the AMA opinions, and, therefore, was
unethical and unprofessional conduct. Dr. Smith’s exception is denied.

3. Dr. Smith had an Inappropriate Sexual Relationship with a Patient.

Sexual relationships with patients are both unprofessional and considered sexual
misconduct under the Board’s sexual misconduct regulations. At the time of the sexual
relationship, the Board’s regulations stated that licensees “may not engage in sexual
misconduct,” COMAR 10.32.17.03, and that Health Occ. § 14-404(6)(3) (immoral or
unprofessional conduct) “includes, but is not limited to, sexual misconduct.” Under COMAR
10.32.17.02B(3)(c) sexual misconduct was defined as including “(e]ngaging in a dating,
romantic, or sexual relationship which violates the code of ethics of the American Medical
Association.”

The State’s expert considered AMA Ethics Opinion 9.1.1 related to romantic or sexual
interactions with patients. Opinion 9.1.1 states that romantic or sexual interactions between
physician and a patient are unethical because they “detract from the goals of the patient-
physician relationship and may exploit the vulnerability of the patient . . . and ultimately be
detrimental to the patient’s well-being.”

Dr. Smith argued that the AMA Code of Medical Ethics 9.1.1 prohibits relationships with
“concurrent” patients, but not former patients. Dr. Smith claimed that his relationship with
Patient B began after he last saw her as a patient and that her last visit was a “line in the sand”
and that he began to socialize with Patient B a month, two or three after the end of the
professional relationship. He explained that he did not issue a cessation of practice discharge

letter because he was only acting as a consultant.
