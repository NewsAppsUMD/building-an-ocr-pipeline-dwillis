demonstrated need due to the high-acuity nature of inpatient care; Dr. Mathur’s participation in a
clinical Outpatient Point-of-Care experience to obtain necessary support and graduated levels of
independence through periods of supervision to address his immediate practice needs in clinical
practice in the outpatient setting; Dr. Mathur’s presentation of all patients to a Preceptor prior to
office discharge to discuss patient evaluation, screening for comorbidities, prescribing and
monitoring of opioids, and treatment planning; Dr. Mathur’s engagement in CME courses and
self-study including an Internal Medicine Review course (inpatient and outpatient), an ECG
Interpretation course, and a CME course in gender and cultural competency.
