B. Caselaw

“Unprofessional Conduct” is not defined by the Medical Practice Act, Health Occ. § 14-101.
Maryland courts have broadly interpreted what may be considered to be “unprofessional
conduct” under Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii). See Finucan, 380 Md. at 597 (sexual relationship
with three patients deemed unprofessional conduct); Salerian v. Maryland State Bd. of
Physicians, 176 Md. App. 231, 249 (2007) (disclosing confidential physician-patient information
was unprofessional conduct); Cornfeld, 174 Md. App. at 468 (dishonesty by lying to a hospital
peer review deemed unprofessional conduct). Courts have stated that “unprofessional conduct” is
“conduct which breaches the rules or ethical code of a profession, or conduct which is
unbecoming” a physician in good standing. Salerian, 176 Md. App. at 248 (quoting Finucan,
380 Md. at 593).

C. Analysis
1. Disposing of the Suicide Paraphernalia was Unprofessional.

Dr. Egbert removed and disposed of the helium tanks, hoods and suicide paraphernalia.
According to the Final Exit book, the Exit Guide removes suicide paraphernalia to hinder any
police investigation, which would lead to longer inquiries. Dr. Egbert’s actions in removing the
suicide paraphernalia not only hindered police investigations, but also caused other physicians
and medical examiners to list the cause of death incorrectly on the patients’ death certificates.
Dr. Silverman, the State’s expert, opined that removing the suicide paraphernalia was deceptive
for these reasons. Honesty with patients and colleagues is a fundamental principle of medical
ethics. See AMA’s Principles of Medical Ethics (http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-
resources/medical-ethics/code-medical-ethics/principles-medical-ethics.page). See also
