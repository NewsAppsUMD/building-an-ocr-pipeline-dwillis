 

has decided that the appropriate sanction in this matter is a one-year suspension under § 14-404,
which shall begin when the summary suspension pursuant to State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2) is
terminated. The summary suspension under § 10-226(c)(2) will be terminated when the
Respondent’s expired license is administratively reinstated. See Health Occ. § 14-317; COMAR
10.32.01.11. Once the license is administratively reinstated, the summary suspension is
terminated, and the suspension under § 14-404 goes into effect, the Respondent will be required
to enroll in the Maryland Professional Rehabilitation Program (“MPRP”) and successfully
complete courses in boundaries and professionalism. See § 14-404(e) After one year from when
the § 14-404 suspension goes into effect, if the Respondent has complied with the terms and
conditions of the suspension and the Panel determines, after reviewing MPRP’s recommendation,
that the Respondent is safe to return to the practice of medicine, then the Respondent will be placed
on probation for a minimum period of two years under terms and conditions that the Panel finds
appropriate. .
ORDER

It is, on the affirmative vote of a majority of the quorum of Panel B, hereby

ORDERED that the order for summary suspension on Dr. Benalcazar’s license, issued on
July 2, 2021, and affirmed in a final decision and order on August 1, 2022, will be terminated as
moot upon the reinstatement of the Respondent’s expired license under Health Occ. § 14-317!%

and it is further

'6 The Respondent’s license expired on September 30, 2022. In order for the summary suspension
to be terminated, the Respondent must apply for the reinstatement of his lapsed license and the
license must be administratively reinstated. See Health Occ. § 14-317; COMAR 10.32.01.11.
Also, for sanctioning purposes, the expiration of the Respondent’s license does not prevent the
Panel from sanctioning him — a license does not lapse by operation of law while the individual is
under investigation or while charges are pending. Health Occ. § 14-403(a).
