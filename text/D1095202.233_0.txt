Re: Carolyn Pass, M.D.
Case No.: 2223-0028
License No.: D10952

Dear Dr. Pass and Counsel:

On February 7, 2023, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2) (2021 Repl.
Vol.). Dr. Pass was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing before
Disciplinary Panel B to show cause why that suspension should not be continued on February 22
2023. Prior to the scheduled hearing Dr. Pass’s counsel contacted the Board and stated that Dr.
Pass waived her right to the post-deprivation hearing. Due to the waiver, Panel B did not hold a
post-deprivation hearing in this matter, the summary suspension continues, and the parties may
proceed to the summary suspension appeal if Dr. Pass requests an evidentiary hearing as
referenced below. COMAR 10.32.02.08E.
