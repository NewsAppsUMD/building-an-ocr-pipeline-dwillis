management, and collegial relationships, including critical comments about her bedside manner
and insensitivity to patients and parents. Dr. Bailey does not address the totality of the reports
and disputes accounts of her unreliability and behavior. She also claims that she was unaware of

actions, Dr. Bailey’s declaration of ownership is not, in the Panel’s opinion, sincere or accurate.
Despite the steps she has taken to address her prior behavior, Dr. Bailey’s recent justifications

During her oral presentation to the Panel, Dr. Bailey stated that she was unaware of

appropriate conduct in the past because she was not focused, and that she has now accepted full
