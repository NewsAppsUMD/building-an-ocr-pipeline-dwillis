(g) The patient.was especially vulnerable;
(h) The offender attempted to hide the error or misconduct from patients
or others; : :

(i) The offender concealed, falsified or destroyed evidence, or presented
false testimony or evidence;

Gj) The offender did not cooperate with the investigation; or

(k) Previous attempts to rehabilitate the offender were unsuccessful.

Under COMAR 10.32.02.10B(4)(b) the maximum sanction that may be imposed for
violating section 14-404(a)(4) is revocation and the minimum sanction is suspension until the .
physician’s physical or mental incompetence is addressed to the Board’s satisfaction. Ahsent
firm confirmation of the permanence of the Respondent’s mental incompetence, I believe that the
appropriate sanction is to keep the Respondent’s license on suspended status until the

Respondent provides information to the Board to establish that he is mentally competent to

resume the practice of medicine.

PROPOSED CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact and Discussion, I conclude as a matter of law
that the summary suspension of the Respondent’s license to practice medicine was proper
because the public health, safety, or welfare imperatively required emergency action. Md. Code
Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2) (2014).

I further conclude as a matter of law that the Respondent violated section 14-404(a)(4) by
being mentally incompetent to practice medicine. Md. Code Ann, Health Oce. § 14-404(a)(4)
(Supp. 2020).

I further conclude that the Respondent is subject to the suspension of his license until the
Respondent provides information to the Board to establish that he is mentally competent to

" tesume the practiee of medicine. Jd; COMAR 10.32.02.09A, B; COMAR 10.32.02.10B(4)(b).
