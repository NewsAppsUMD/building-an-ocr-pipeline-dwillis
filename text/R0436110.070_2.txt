postponement of the prehearing conference and that Mr, Taylor had not submitted a prehearing
statement, as instructed. After waiting fifteen minutes for Mr. Taylor to appear, and after trying
to reach Mr. Taylor by telephone without success, the ALJ proceeded to hold the prehearing
conference in Mr. Taylor’s absence. The State moved for-a default judgment against Mr. Taylor.

Under OAH’s rules of procedure, “[i]f, after receiving proper notice, a party fails to attend
or participate in a prehearing conference, hearing, or other stage of a proceeding, the judge may
proceed in that party’s absence or may, in accordance with the hearing authority delegated by the
agency, issue a final or proposed default order against the defaulting party.” COMAR
28.02.01.23A.

On July 30, 2020, the ALJ issued a Proposed Default Order. The ALJ found that Mr.
Taylor had proper notice of the July 28, 2020 prehearing confercnce and that he failed to appear
or participate in the prehearing conference. The ALJ proposed that the Panel find Mr. Taylor in
default, adopt as findings of fact the statements set out in the allegations of fact section of the
charges, conclude as a matter of law that Mr. Taylor violated Health Occ. § 14-5B-14(a)(3), (4),
and (26) in the manner set forth in the charges, and revoke his license to practice as a Radiographer.

The ALJ mailed copies of the Proposed Default Order to Mr. Taylor, the administrative
prosecutor, and the Board at the parties’ respective addresses of record. The Proposed Default
Order notified the parties that they may file written exceptions to the proposed order but must do
so within 15 days of the date of the Proposed Default Order. The Proposed Default Order stated
that any exceptions and request for a hearing must be sent to the Board with attention to the Board’s
Executive Director. Neither party filed exceptions. On September 9, 2020, this case came before

Disciplinary Panel A (“Panel A”) of the Board for final disposition.
