SANCTION

Pursuant to the September 3, 2019 Order of Reinstatement, upon a finding of a violation,
the Panel may reprimand Dr. Yacoub, place Dr. Yacoub on further probation with appropriate
terms and conditions, or suspend or revoke Dr. Yacoub’s license to practice medicine in
Maryland. Dr. Yacoub’s disciplinary history with the Board began in 2013 when he was ordered
to cease and desist from prescribing CDS and performing surgical procedures. At that time, Dr.
Yacoub was charged with unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, being addicted to
or habitually abusing a narcotic or controlled dangerous substance, selling, prescribing, giving
away, or administering drugs for illegal or illegitimate purposes, and failing to comply with the
dispensing provisions of the Maryland Pharmacy Act, and he surrendered his license at that time
to avoid further prosecution. In 2016, the Panel declined to reinstate Dr, Yacoub’s license
because he had not demonstrated judgment and understanding about his own substance use.
When the Panel reinstated Dr. Yacoub’s license to practice medicine in 2019, the Panel relied on
Dr. Yacoub’s assurances that he was sincere about preventing a recurrence and that he appeared
to take responsibility for his actions. The Panel believed that any remaining concerns it had
regarding Dr. Yacoub could be addressed with appropriate monitoring and restrictions on his
CDS practice and, therefore, the Panel gave Dr. Yacoub the opportunity to resume the practice of
medicine under certain conditions in order to protect the public. However, within one month of
Dr. Yacoub enrolling in MPRP, he violated his Rehabilitation Agreement with MPRP on two
occasions. The Panel believes that revocation is warranted.

ORDER

It is, thus, by Board Disciplinary Panel B, hereby

ORDERED that the license of John K. Yacoub, M.D., license number D30010, to
practice medicine in Maryland, is REVOKED; and it is further
