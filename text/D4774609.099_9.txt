10,.32.02.07E(3). Instead, he sought to address the Panel regarding his case charged under
Health Occ. § 14-404(b) at the DCCR scheduled in connection with the charges issued under
Health Occ. § 14-404(a). To the extent that Dr. Burke’s request to address the Panel at the
DCCR can be interpreted as a request for a hearing in this case, Panel B denies the request. The
determination of whether the crime in this case involved moral turpitude is a question of law,
which does not require an evidentiary hearing or consideration of any facts beyond the elements
of the conviction itself.

Upon determining that a licensee has been convicted of a crime involving moral
turpitude, Health Occ. § 14-404(b)(2) requires a disciplinary panel to order the revocation of a
license after the completion of appellate proceedings. Dr. Burke cites three categories of cases
where a disciplinary panel issued orders of revocation in 2019 and argues that the facts in his
case warrant a lesser sanction when compared to other orders of revocation issued by a
disciplinary panel in the past year, In all three categories of cases cited by Dr. Burke, however,
the Respondent was charged and disciplined under Health Occ. § 14-404(a), and not under
Health Occ. § 14-404(b).° While in cases charged under Health Occ. § 14-404(a), the
disciplinary panel has the discretion to impose a sanction of a reprimand, probation, suspension,
or revocation, Health Occ. § 14-404(b)(2) requires a disciplinary panel to revoke the license of
an individual upon the completion of appellate proceedings if the disciplinary panel determines
that the licensee was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. The Panel rejects his

arguments.

Sin the third category, Dr, Burke cites a case where the Respondent was convicted of a crime involving moral
turpitude during the pendency of charges filed under Health Occ. § 14-404(a) and after the opportunity for a
settlement conference and hearing at the Office of the Administrative Hearings. Prior to the commencement of an
action filed under Health Occ. § 14-404(b), the Respondent agreed to enter into a Consent Order to resolve the
charges filed under Health Occ. § 14-404(a) with an 8-year revocation of his medical license. See Jn the Matter of
Atif B. Malik, M.D., Case Numbers 2218-0036B and 2219-0039A.
