from 2009 but then discontinued treatment in 2011. Patient 6 returned for treatment in
August 2017. Patient 6 had a history of back pain and in the past, had been on various
psychiatric medications. The Respondent diagnosed Patient 6 with MDD, Anxiety
Disorder and ADHD.

26. When Patient 6 returned for treatment in 2017, the Respondent gave her the
same diagnoses as in 2009, At this time, Patient 6’s anxiety was significantly better but
her depression was much worse. The Respondent placed Patient 6 on Mydayis for
ADHD; Trintellix; and Halcion at bedtime. At this time, the Respondent assessed Patient
6 for suicide risk, but did not do so in subsequent treatment notes.

27. After reinitiating treatment, the Respondent altered Patient 6’s
pharmacologic regimen. As of May 2018, the Respondent was prescribing Adderall XR
30 gm, daily; Trintellix 20 mg, daily; Ambien CR 12.5 mg, at bedtime as needed;
Phentermine 37.5 mg, daily as needed for weight gain; Xanax 1 mg, three times per day,
as needed; and Abilify 5 mg, daily. The Respondent completed an updated psychiatric
assessment in August 2018.

28. In October 2018, the Respondent increased Patient 6’s Adderall XR to 40
gm and changed her Ambien to Lunesta due to the Ambien losing its efficacy. In

January 2019, the Respondent made no changes to her medication regimen and noted that

Patient 6’s mood was generally good.
