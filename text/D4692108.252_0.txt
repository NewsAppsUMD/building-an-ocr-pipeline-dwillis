Re: George A. Oyler, M.D.
Case No.: 2223-0007B
License No.: D46921

Dear Dr. Oyler and Counsel:

On August 11, 2022, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued George A. Oyler, M.D., License Number D46921, an ORDER FOR SUMMARY
SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md.
Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2). Under § 10-226(c)(2)(ii)2, after an order for summary
suspension is issued, the agency shall promptly give the subject of the order an opportunity to be
heard. Thus, the Board scheduled a post-deprivation hearing in this matter for August 24, 2022,
before Panel B. However, on August 23, 2022, counsel for Dr. Oyler notified the Board that Dr.
Oyler waived his right to the post-deprivation hearing, that Dr. Oyler was in agreement with the
continuation of the order for summary suspension at this time, and that the hearing did not need
to remain on the panel’s agenda. Therefore, Panel B will not terminate the order for summary
suspension at this time, and the order for summary suspension, imposed on August 11, 2022, is
reaffirmed and continues in effect.
