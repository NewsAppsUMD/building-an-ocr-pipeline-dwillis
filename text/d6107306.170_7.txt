The Respondent was subsequently readmitted, but was then discharged for
noncompliance with the center's rules and for possession of unapproved
controlled dangerous substances (CDS).

The Respondent then entered into the in-patient program at a different in-
patient center (“Center B”), which subsequently referred her to a more
intensive program (“Center C’”). .

The Respondent submitted a written response to the Complaint, in which
she stated that in the days leading up to her suspension from Practice A,
she-had taken “some old prescribed [CDS] for several nights to try to sleep.”
The Respondent’s personnel file from Practice A also documents several
related instances of unprofessional conduct and treatment errors consistent
with impairment, including entering the wrong dosage on prescriptions and
ordering tests but then forgetting that she had ordered them.

The file also contains documented admissions from the Respondent stating
she is attempting to wean herself off opioids.

On or about November 21, 2017, the Board received an updated Mandated
10-Day Report from Practice A informing the Board that, effective

November 15, 2017, the Respondent had resigned.
