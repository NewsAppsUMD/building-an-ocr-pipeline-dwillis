interview, the Respondent denied that he administered the phenylephrine on July 30, 2020
and stated he was unaware of this visit occurring. Rather, the Respondent stated that Staff
Member No. 1 administered the shot.

33. On Friday, July 31, 2020, Complainant No. 3 returned to the Clinic again
with priapism. Complainant No. 3 was accompanied by his fiancée at this visit. The
Complainant and his fiancée stated that the Respondent came into the room, had a
conversation with Staff Member No. 1, and then left the room. Then, Staff Member No. 1
administered a phenylephrine shot into Complainant No. 3’s penis. Again, there was no
relief; however Complainant No. 3 experienced severe pain when the shot was
administered. The Respondent then returned to the room and gave Complainant No. 3 and
his fiancée instructions to purchase and administer Sudafed before they left the Clinic.

34. The priapism continued and on Saturday, August 1, 2020, Complainant No.
3 and his fiancée called the Clinic for advice on how much Sudafed to take. Staff Member
No. 1 responded with dosage instructions and asked Complainant No. 3 to return to the
Clinic so he could give him another phenylephrine shot before Staff Member No. 1 left for
the day. Complainant No. 3 did not return to the Clinic that day.

35. On Sunday, August 2, 2020, Complainant No. 3 sought treatment at a local
Health Care Facility for priapism. The Health Care Facility documented it was unable “to
get priapism to resolve as expected due to the long duration of 5 days.” A specialist
informed Complainant No. 3 that he likely will require a penile prosthesis due to the

development of fibrosis from prolonged priapism.
