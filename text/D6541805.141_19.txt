In considering aggravating factors, COMAR 10.32.02.09B(6), the most significant are that
the Respondent has a disciplinary history with the Board, the conduct was committed deliberately,
the offenses had the potential for patient harm, and there was a pattern to his conduct. The Panel
does not find any significant mitigating factors. COMAR 10.32.02.09B(5). When the
Respondent’s conduct is considered with the extensive and significant violations in this case and
his disciplinary history, permanent revocation of the Respondent's license is warranted.
