MPRP’s recommendations, missed check-in appointments, and positive toxicology screenings.
On July 27, 2016, Dr. Kreger appeared at a Show Cause hearing before Panel B. She did not
dispute that she failed to comply with the MPRP’s recommendations in June and July of 2015
and failed to check-in with the random toxicology call-in telephone system on seven dates
between July of 2015 and March of 2016.’
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Panel B concludes that Dr. Kreger violated the terms and conditions of the April 16, 2015
Consent Order by failing to fully comply with all of the MPRP’s requirements and treatment
recommendations. Pursuant to the terms of the Consent Order, the panel is authorized to impose
additional sanctions on Dr. Kreger’s license.

SANCTION

In determining the appropriate sanction in this case, the Panel has taken into
consideration the positions of both parties as well as the recommendation of the MPRP, which
was expressed in a letter to the Board, dated April 22, 2016. Both the State and Dr. Kreger
advocated for continued treatment and participation with the MPRP and asked the Panel to
impose a definitive timeline for when Dr. Kreger could return to practice. The MPRP noted that
they believed that Dr. Kreger had made improvements, despite the ongoing issues of compliance,
but indicated that they would like to see additional stability and documented progress before the
clinical team would endorse her return to the practice of medicine. Accordingly, the MPRP
recommended a fixed period of suspension and continued participation with the MPRP. Based

on the limited duration that Dr. Kreger has been enrolled in the MPRP and the issues she has had

7 Dr. Kreger denied that she consumed any alcohol while enrolled in the MPRP and, therefore, disputed the positive
toxicology screenings. In light of the other violations, which are discussed herein, the Panel need not reach this
issue, and declines to do so.
