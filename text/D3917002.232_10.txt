reasoning in a general medicine practice setting. As the State noted, the remediation
recommended was a structured, individualized, educational intervention.

Contrary to Dr. Mathur’s characterization of the Consent Order’s requirements and the
Program’s Report, Panel A finds that the State’s analysis is correct. It was undisputed that Dr.
Mathur entered into the March 4, 2020 Consent Order freely and voluntarily and has experience
with the Consent Order process, conditions, and compliance requirements. It was also undisputed
that Dr. Mathur did not ever propose, contract with, or request Board approval for any supervisor
in any specialty at any time before returning to medical practice, as required by the Consent
Order.

By resuming medical practice unsupervised, Panel A finds that Dr. Mathur defied the
Consent Order’s supervision requirements. In addition, Panel A finds that it was Dr. Mathur’s
responsibility to ensure that his health information requested by the Program was submitted. In
failing to do so, Dr. Mathur did not fully and timely comply with all the Program’s rules and
requirements, in violation of the Consent Order. Based upon the report from the Program and the
evidence presented at the show cause hearing,.Panel A further finds that the results of Dr.
Mathur’s clinical competency assessment confirm the Program’s determination that Dr. Mathur
is not clinically competent to practice medicine, in violation of the Consent Order.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Panel A concludes that Dr. Mathur violated the terms and conditions of the March 4,
2020 Consent Order based on the Program’s determination that he was not clinically competent
to practice medicine, his failure to provide the health information requested by the Program, and

his failure to propose or obtain a supervisor before resuming the practice of medicine.
