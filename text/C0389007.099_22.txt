Board, she had no reasonable basis for believing anyone had filed one to cover the period from
July 2015 through her termination in 2017. .

The Respondent testified she assumed Physician B would supervise her when he joined
Practice A (where the Respondent was working) in March or April 2015. Physician B may have
been her supervisor under the hospital’s organizational structure, but the Respondent had no
reason to believe he was her supervising physician under a delegation agreement since she had
never completed and signed, and had Physician B complete his portion and sign, an application
for Physician B to serve in that capacity,

The Respondent argues she acted in accordance with “hospital regulation” at the time.
The Respondent did not cite any particular regulation, or even policy, but that is hardly the point.
The Respondent was obligated to act in accordance with the Maryland statute and the Board’s
regulations pertaining to her practice as physician assistant.

The Respondent testified when Hospital A hired her “it was brought to my attention that
any credentialing in lieu of license is done by the hospital,” Tr. 67. Tam unclear what she
means by “credentialing in lieu of” her license. The Respondent testified she understands she
needs two documents to work as a physician assistant: a Board-issued license and a delegation
agreement. One is not in lieu of the other. She was responsible for ensuring she had filed all
necessary documents to work as a physician assistant.

Because the Respondent worked as a physician assistant for two years without a
delegation agreement, I find the Respondent is guilty of unprofessional conduct in the practice of
medicine and she performed delegated medical acts without the supervision of a physician, both

as charged by the Board.
