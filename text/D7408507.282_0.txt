Case No.: 2222-0128
License No,: D74085

Dear Dr. Kumar and Counsel:

On July 13, 2022, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued
an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE
in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2). On July 27, 2022, Dr.
Kumar was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing before Disciplinary Panel
B to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. Dr. Kumar appeared at the post-
deprivation hearing with counsel. The State was represented by JoAnna Miller, Assistant
Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor.

After consideration of the presentations from the State and Dr. Kumar, Disciplinary Panel
B determined, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the health, safety, and welfare of the
public imperatively required the disciplinary panel to summarily suspend Dr. Kumar’s license
and there exists a substantial risk of serious harm to the public health, safety, and welfare in Dr.
Kumar’s continued practice. Disciplinary Panel B thus will not lift the summary suspension
order, and the summary suspension imposed on July 13, 2022, is reaffirmed and continues in
effect. See COMAR 10.32.02.08H(1).
