she was prescribed because her previous physician had closed his practice and the information
was not available. The patient was immediately referred by the Respondent following her first
visit on April 8, 2013 for surgery to restore loss of bladder and bowel function, The surgery was
successful. Patient D was weaned off oxycontin and was prescribed oxycodone, even though her
pain was chronic and long term.

Patient D visited the Respondent more frequently than the customary two week intervals
during May and July of 2013 but was given prescriptions during these visits for two weeks worth
of medication even though the medication would not run out if taken properly. There is no
evidence to indicate whether the medications were taken properly because no urine tests were
conducted during this period.

Finally, although the Respondent considers the treatment of Patient D as “one of the
successes of XpressMedCare’s pain management section” (Tr. 306), the Respondent failed to
utilize other modalities of treatment for Patient D, including the use of neuromodulator
medications such as anticonvulsants and antidepressants to address the pain. Other modalities
may have reduced or even eliminated the need for opioid medications.

was not offered other alternatives. As in other cases discussed, the Respondent did not order

urine screens or employ other means to determine if medications prescribed were being taken as
