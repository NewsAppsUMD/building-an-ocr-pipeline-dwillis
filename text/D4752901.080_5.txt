interactions.” Further, “[the Respondent] [did] not document why he
[chose] such potentially dangerous mixes of drugs” and “{did] not
record whether he [had] detailed discussions with the patients about
the potential dangers of the drugs he [prescribed] including the
potential for drug abuse relapse.” The Respondent did not provide
appropriate informed consent to these patients in these situations.

Second, “[the Respondent] fail[ed] to recognize the seriousness of his
patients’ medical problems by not performing detailed histories and

b. Patient 2:

“Patient [was] to have surgery for osteomyelitis in left leg. He
perform[ed] a pre-op physical exam. [The Respondent
