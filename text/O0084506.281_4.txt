sign in for her 1:00 p.m. hearing. On May 12, 2021, at 1:06 p.m., six minutes after the time

violation and recommended the revocation of Ms. Hyler’s license.

2020 Consent Order by failing to comply on multiple occasions with a condition of the
Participant Rehabilitation Agreement she entered into with MPRP..

SANCTION

Pursuant to the January 6, 2020 Consent Order, upon a finding of a violation, the Panel
may reprimand Ms. Hyler, place Ms. Hyler on probation with appropriate terms and conditions,
suspend, or revoke Ms. Hyler’s license to practice medicine in Maryland. Ms. Hyler signed the
Participant Rehabilitation Agreement on September 28, 2020, and, less than two months later,
she violated the agreement multiple times. MPRP informed Panel A on December 2, 2020, that

Hyler from the program for cause. Based on Ms. Hyler’s failure to comply with the
requirements of the Consent Order, the Panel revokes Ms. Hyler’s license.
