of tests, and other details. Most of these misstatements are of minor significance, however. And
there were several concerns of the Respondent’s practice that the ALJ found rose to the level of a
violation where the Panel does not. But overall, the ALJ did correctly find that State proved
significant violations of the Maryland Medical Practice Act. The Panel has thus written this
decision to focus on the most profound violations.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
L BILLING FOR SERVICES NOT PROVIDED

1. BILLING FOR DAYS IN WHICH THERE WAS NO PATIENT VISIT OR
ENCOUNTER.

The Respondent billed on several occasions for testing and services that were not
provided, as demonstrated by the fact that his records contain billing forms indicating he billed
for testing and services on days in which there was no patient visit or encounter.

The Respondent billed for a March 24, 2014, visit with Patient 1, even though there was
no visit with Patient 1 that day. (St. Ex. 16 at 160.) The Respondent billed $250 under CPT code
99245, $2640 for a SPT for 264 allergens tested, and $100 for a SP with bronchodilator for a
total charge of $2990. The Respondent signed the billing form with the signature date of March
24, 2014. The Respondent testified, however, “Patient 1 came into my care April the 15" of
2014.” (Tr. 392.) And the Respondent wrote in his summary that Patient 1 was first seen in his
office on April 15, 2014. The progress notes make no reference to a visit on March 24, 2014.
As Dr. Drelich stated in his report, “There is also the billing on March 24, 2014 for 264 skin
tests, although there is no notation in the chart of this encounter.” The ALJ correctly found that
the Respondent billed for a SPT and SP for March 24, 2014, with a total bill of $2990. With
respect to this finding, the Respondent’s exceptions only state, “the record does not support the

finding of a 3/24/14 encounter for Patient 1.” This further makes clear that the Respondent did
