to refer patients for substance abuse treatment and counseling, taper the
patients off opioids, or discharge the patients from his practice (Patients
1-10);

d. The Respondent increased patients’ opioid doses based on subjective
complaints of pain but failed to document objective findings to carefully
justify increasing opioid doses significantly above the CDC Guideline
(Patients 1-10);

e. The Respondent failed to consider or refer patients for alternative
treatments such as physical or chiropractic therapy, and/or
interventional injection treatments (Patients 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10);

f. The Respondent failed to require that patients obtain EKG studies to
assess any cardiac changes from certain opioids (Patients 5 and 8); and

g. The Respondent prescribed benzodiazepines to patients who were also
prescribed high-dose opiates without verifying anxiety diagnoses with a
mental health provider, and without providing appropriate or accurate
counseling on how to avoid dangerous or fatal interactions between the
drugs (Patients 2, 4, 6, and 8).
D. Supplemental Report of Peer Reviewer 2

19. On May 2, 2020, Peer Reviewer 2 wrote a letter to the Board
supplementing his previously submitted peer-review report. Peer Reviewer 2 expressed
his concern about the Respondent’s “clear pattern of excessive opioid prescribing,” and
his “proclivity for dangerous opioid prescribing habits and extremely risky treatment
patterns[.]” Peer Reviewer 2 also wrote that the “overwhelming evidence [shows] that
most of the patients [ ] reviewed had a Substance Use Disorder . . . and [the Respondent]
ignored clear indications that these patients needed Substance Use Disorder treatments

and were being placed at greater risk by continuing to prescribe opioids to them.”

20. Peer Reviewer 2 further noted that the Respondent does not accept

insurance and requires all patients to pay in cash at the time of their appointments.
