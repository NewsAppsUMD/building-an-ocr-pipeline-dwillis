procedure put Patient 5 at risk for bleeding, thrombosis, arterial
dissection, and arterial occlusion.

c, The Respondent performed multiple invasive procedures on Patient
6 who initially presented for evaluation of possible artery or vein
obstruction in the left leg. At the time of the initial visit, Patient 6
had the ability to walk approximately one (1) mile before the onset
of leg pain. Patient 6 endured worsening symptoms and an inability
to walk after the initial left leg arteriogram performed by the
Respondent. The Respondent continued to perform left leg
arteriograms on Patient 6 despite worsening perfusion and more
severe symptoms in that leg.

d. The Respondent incorrectly diagnosed Patient 10 with peripheral
arterial disease (PAD)'® and thus treated Patient 10 with a number of
arterial interventions which worsened her lower extremity perfusion.
This over-utilization of both unnecessary diagnostic and invasive
procedures is harmful to patients.

Risk of harm related to sedation

28. The Respondent utilized intravenous (“IV”) sedation on multiple patients in
his performance of the aforementioned invasive procedures, The Respondent, however,
typically failed to document the results of monitoring of the patients who had undergone
sedation'’ in accordance with the invasive procedure. The medical records demonstrate
'S Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is the narrowing or blockage of the vessels that carry blood from the

heart to the legs, It is primarily caused by the buildup of fatty plaque in the arteries,
" See e.g., Patients 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, and 11.
