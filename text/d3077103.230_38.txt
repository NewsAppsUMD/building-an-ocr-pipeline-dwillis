making her testimony credible. The Respondent attempted to minimize the importance of these

" documents arguing that all he did was open the documents on his computer because they were in

his task folder, I find that he opened the documents because he was the physician at the practice
who ordered the lab work as part of his treatment of Individual A. I further do not believe the
Respondent for the following reason. A review of a radiologist report from August 2, 2016,

indicates the Respondent as the requesting physician for the contrast scans. The document lists

‘Individual A’s symptoms as “malignant neoplasm of cervix, uteri, unspecified.” On the

document section for sign off, it indicates, “signed by Robert Hardi on 8/11/2016 11:37 am.”
(State Ex. A2, p, 54).

The Respondent’s name appears on other documents in Individual A’s medical record for
the time period that he was treating her while they were having a sexual relationship, However, I
only gave weight to those documents that could be authenticated. For example, A | patient
record for Individual A from July 21, 2016, identifies the Respondent as the physician provider
for Individual A. This record was created on July 21, 2016 at 11:43 a.m. The record references a
colonoscopy that occurred on September 28, 2017. Someone altered the July 21, 2016 patient
record to include a September 28, 2017 medical procedure. This is not a typographical error.
The record was deliberately altered to include the September 28, 2017 medical procedure which
could not have been known when the note was drafted on July 21, 2016. The July 21, 2016
medical record has a space for an electronic signature. The signature line is blank and un signed,
It is undisputed that many people at | including Individual A, had access to Individual A’s

electronic medical record and could have altered these documents. I do not know who altered

_the documents, Nevertheless, the records that can be authenticated indicate that the Respondent

ordered and reviewed lab work for Individual A regarding symptoms she experienced because he ,

was treating her for her medical condition that caused her to participate in the study, Any other
