2016, the Virginia Board suspended her license as a reciprocal action.
Maryland: Charges and 2016 Consent Order

Following the Board’s investigation and receipt of information revealing Dr. Bailey's
criminal and disciplinary history in Virginia and New York, Panel B issued charges against Dr.
Bailey on May 26, 2016. The charges were based on her false responses to questions on her
application for the reinstatement of her Maryland medical license? in October 2014, and a
determination that she submitted an altered Continuing Medical Education (“CME”) certificate?
with her application. Panel B also based charges on the March 2016 revocation of her medical
license in New York. On November 12, 2015, during the Board's investigation, Dr. Bailey
admitted under oath in a Board interview that:

(1) The multiple CDS prescriptions in the names of fictitious patients that she wrote from

2010 to 2013 and for which she was arrested in Virginia in 2013 were for herself;

(2) She did not disclose her Virginia criminal history on her Maryland 2014 application

for reinstatement because she “thought the charges were going to be dismissed”;

(3) She falsified her CME certificate because she could not find her most recent CMEs;

(4) She did not have an active DEA license at the time of her interview; and

(5) She was under stress at that time due to family illnesses and financial pressures.

On August 25, 2016, Dr. Bailey entered into a Consent Order with Panel B to resolve the
charges. Panel B concluded that Dr. Bailey violated Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. §§ 14-
404(a)(1), (3), (11), and (36) by willfully failing to disclose her guilty pleas in 2013 for
prescription fraud in Virginia on her 2014 reinstatement application to the Maryland Board.

Panel B also concluded that Dr. Bailey was subject to discipline under the reciprocal discipline

* Dr. Bailey falsely answered “NO” to questions on her Maryland application asking if she had committed a
criminal act to which she pled guilty or for which she was convicted . . ., despite her guilty pleas to Virginia
criminal authorities in 2013 to obtaining drugs by fraud and attempted prescription fraud.

> Dr. Bailey attached a certificate of continuing medical education (*CME”) to her 2014 application to show that
she had taken a pediatric review course for 60 CMEs in May 2014. A subsequent Board investigation revealed that
Dr. Bailey had altered ihe CME certificate she submitted with her application and that the actual date of the course
was May 2001.
