CONCLUSION OF LAW

Panel B concludes that Ms. Goles failed to comply with suspension condition 2(c) of the

July 19, 2021 Consent Order by failing to comply with treatment as directed by MPRP.
SANCTION

Pursuant to the July 19, 2021 Consent Order, upon a finding of'a violation, the Panel may
reprimand Ms. Goles, place Ms. Goles on probation with appropriate terms and conditions,
suspend, or revoke Ms. Goles’s license to practice medicine in Maryland. Ms. Goles was given
multiple opportunities to comply with MPRP as required by the Consent Order. She sought and
was granted three postponements to sign the Participant Rehabilitation Agreement, three
postponements to obtain an Independent Medical Evaluation, and when she asked for a second
opinion instead of enrolling in the inpatient treatment, she was given another two chances to either
obtain a second opinion or to comply with MPRP’s treatment recommendation. Ms. Goles
declined to do either, which constituted a violation of the Consent Order. Ms.. Goles has
demonstrated an inability or unwillingness to comply with MPRP’s directive to undergo the
treatment directed by MPRP. Based on Ms. Goles’s failure to comply with the requirements of
the Consent Order, the Panel revokes Ms. Goles’s license.
