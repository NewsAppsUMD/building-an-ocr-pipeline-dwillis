ORDER AFTER SHOW CAUSE HEARING

On October 30, 2017, Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”) Disciplinary
Panel B (“Panel B”) issued an Order After Show Cause Hearing concerning Philip W. Halstead,
M.D., that, pertinent to this case, included a condition requiring him to have monthly face-to-
face meetings with a supervising physician to discuss ten patient’s charts for a minimum of two
years from the date of the first satisfactory peer report. Dr. Halstead was required to ensure that
the supervising physician submitted quarterly reports that detailed any concerns with Dr.
Halstead’s medical practice.

On January 28, 2019, after receiving three quarterly reports that noted practice
deficiencies and his failure to meet face-to-face with his supervisor on seven instances, Panel B
issued an Amended Violation of Consent Order and Notice to Show Cause,! which notified Dr.
Halstead of the alleged violation of this condition of the October 2017 Order and gave him the
opportunity to appear at another hearing before Panel B to show cause why additional sanctions
should not be imposed against his license. On March 27, 2019, Dr. Halstead appeared before
Panel B at a Show Cause hearing. The State argued that Dr. Halstead’s violation merited a
comprehensive assessment and training. Dr. Halstead admitted that he did not meet face-to-face
with his supervising physician as required by the October 2017 Order. He further admitted that

‘A Violation of Order and Notice to Show Cause was issued on January 11, 2019, but was
superseded by the Amended Violation of Consent Order and Notice to Show Cause.
