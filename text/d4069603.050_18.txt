[she] wouldn’t answer me back when I apologized,” but denied his follow up message that
read, “why are you screwing with me?”

33. When questioned about statements the Respondent allegedly made to
Employee B about opening a “topless” imaging center, the Respondent denied making such
statements and claimed that any comments were in the context of giving advice to
Employee B on her planned trip to Key West, Florida. The Respondent claimed that he
actually told Employee B to avoid “all the new bars and the transvestite bars” and the areas
where “heavy partying goes on.” The Respondent stated that in fact, “the conversation
happened in the context of me helping her find a place where she . . . and her children
would not be exposed to some of the badder (sic) elements of Key West.”

34, The Respondent acknowledged that he was instructed not to have contact
with any of the staff persons following his meeting with the HR Department but stated that
despite this, he sent an email to Employee E.

35, The Respondent also acknowledged that even though he was instructed not
to contact staff persons, he called Employee B on his last day and told her to “go f**k
herself.” He stated, “So yes, it was a terrible thing to do. I extremely regret doing that. I
would not have done it had I not been egged on, whatever, not that that’s an excuse. I’m
an adult. But, yes, I did that.” The Respondent stated, “I can also say that there was an
atmosphere at the Facility in that department from the beginning that was too collegial
between myself and the technologists and I think it lent itself to, at times, a less than

professional atmosphere. And I will admit that it’s my fault.”
