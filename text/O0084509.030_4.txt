approximately 10:00pm and 2:00am. The Respondent said that as soon as she
took the drugs into her system she knew that something was not right with the
dosage and she felt it was “much more potent than anything [she] had ever
experienced.” She stated that she “passed out” around approximately 3:00am
and arrived at work at 7:30am. The Respondent said that on her drive into work
she felt “a little off but didn’t feel the level of impaired that [she] very clearly
objectively was.”

14. Upon arriving at work, the Respondent stated that she was conducting an x-ray?
from the imaging seat and felt like she was having trouble operating the machine
as she normally would. At this point one of the Respondent’s colleagues stepped
in to assist and someone informed the Respondent’s Supervisor of the
Respondent’s actions. The Supervisor informed the Respondent of her
colleagues’ observations and stated that they wanted her to go to have the FFD
evaluation. The Respondent stated that she understood the gravity of that request
and consented. She stated that after she was sent home that day, she had no
further contact from the Hospital until she was notified of her termination via
phone call on April 8, 2019. In response to being asked about the FFD evaluation
results the Respondent stated, “I was not fit for duty...it was not a safe

environment for myself and definitely not for my patients.”

° An x-ray is an image made by projecting x-rays through organs or structures of the body onto an image receptor.
