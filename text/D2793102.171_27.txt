_ that the Respondent’s medical license had been suspended in Virginia. The lag time between the
Respondent’s failure to disclose the information and the Board’s learning of the action by the
Virginia Board prevented the Board from promptly looking into allegations that the Respondent
practiced in an ineffective and/or incompetent manner in Virginia.

‘ The Respondent agreed that $5,000.00 was an appropriate fine for this violation and one
‘that he could afford, albeit maybe over time with a payinent plan given the fact that his medical
career has been in flux recently and his income has been severely reduced since 2015.* The
Respondent, who expressed remorse over his failure to disclose the Virginia investigation on his
2018 renewal application, concurred with the State that a $5,000.00 fine is consistent with
regular practice in Maryland and conceded there is statutory basis for that antount. I therefore
recommend that the Board impose a fine of $5,000.00 on the Respondent for his failure to

The Suspension of the Respondent’s Medical License

The State advocates for an indefinite suspension of the Respondent’s medical license for
a period of not less than twelve months. The State argues that this not only matches the
discipline imposed by the Virginia Board, but also fulfills the Board’s obligation to the citizens
of Maryland to take some action against the-Respondent’s license after learning that he had been
adjudged’ to have practiced ina substandard manner in another state, The State’ asserts that ;
anything less than a suspension would be insufficient based upon the Respondent's disciplinary
history. *

The Respondent, while expressing an understanding of the nature of the violations he
committed, urges me not to recommend that his license be suspended. The Respondent

explained that he works largely with underserved populations and often will not charge for his

 

‘Tn 2015 the Respondent went through a contentious divorce; he lost his Virginia offices im the divorce proceedings.
In 2018, the Respondent also closed bis Silver Spring practice for reasons that were not specified in the record. He
currently maintains only an office i in Greenbelt, Maryland.
