The peer reviewers submitted reports to the Board addressing the standard of care, the
maintenance of adequate medical records, and the overutilization of health services.
WI. = Failure to Meet Standard of Quality Medical Care

14. The peer reviewers independently concluded that the Respondent failed to
meet appropriate standards for the delivery of quality medical care in ten (10) of the eleven
(11) patients whose charts were reviewed.

15. The peer reviewers found that the Respondent often incorrectly diagnosed
patients with peripheral arterial disease (“PAD”)* and other vascular diseases in the
absence of clinical justification.’ The Respondent would then perform or recommend
medically unnecessary invasive vascular procedures and interventions as part of the
patients’ treatment plan.°

16. The Respondent performed invasive procedures including but not limited to:
angiogram, angioplasty,’ aortogram,® arteriogram,? intravascular ultrasound (IVUS),!° vein
ablation,!! venacavogram,!* and atherectomy.!? These procedures involve the insertion of
a catheter through the skin into an area of the body such as the arm, leg, or groin area.

Additionally, in an atherectomy, rotating blades are used to remove plaque in an artery.

4 Peripheral arterial disease (“PAD”) is the narrowing or blockage of the vessels that carry blood from the
heart to the legs. It is primarily caused by the buildup of fatty plaque in the arteries.
