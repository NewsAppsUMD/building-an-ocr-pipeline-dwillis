CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Disciplinary Panel A concludes, as a matter of law, that Dr. Hill fraudulently or
deceptively obtained or attempted to obtain a license, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(1),
was guilty of unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation of Health Oce. §
14-404(a)(3)(i), and willfully made a false representation when seeking or making application
for licensure, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(36). These grounds were based on the
failure to report his pending disciplinary charges on his 2018 renewal application. Disciplinary
Panel A also concludes as a matter of law, that Dr. Hill was disciplined by a licensing or
disciplinary authority for an act that would be grounds for disciplinary action in Maryland, in
violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(21). The Panel concludes that the underlying grounds for
the section 14-404(a)(21) violation are: Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii), is guilty of
unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine; § 14-404(a)(19), grossly over-utilizing health
care services; § 14-404(a)(22), fails to meet appropriate standards as to the delivery of quality
medical or surgical care; and § 14-404(a)(33) fails to cooperate with a lawful investigation.

SANCTION

The ALJ recommended a sanction of an indefinite suspension for at least one year and a
$5,000 fine. Dr. Hill argues that he should not be suspended, but, rather, he should be
reprimanded and required to receive education through peer mentorship. He argues that the
Panel should not consider his prior Board orders in 2003 and 2009 because the deficiencies
found in the orders were so long ago and were not related to the present violation. Additionally,
he argues that the two violations were his only violations in over 30 years of practice. Next, he

argues that he had never been placed on probation in the prior Board cases and that the conduct

 

prohibited from collaterally challenging the Virginia Board action at the OAH hearing because of the
ALJ's grant of the motion in limine. He may challenge the motion in limine before the panel.
