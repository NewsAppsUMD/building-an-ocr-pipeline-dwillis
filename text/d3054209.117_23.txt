 

for him, as a-“respected doctor in the community” to “vet” S.W. about her religious beliefs and
to warn her that regardless of the teachings of her religion, murder is not permissible in the
United States. (Tr., pp. 395, 399-400.)

The Respondent did not disputé that he locked Patient A in the exam room, out of
S.W.’s reach and sight. According to him, he did:so because he thought it was rude of S.W. to
make a call on her cell phone in his consultation room, and he was upset she told the person to
whom she was speaking that the Respondent was behaving unprofessionally. The Respondent
seemed wholly unable to draw any correlation between (1) his decision to question S.W. about
her religious beliefs and to counsel her about the inappropriateness of committing murder and,
(2) 8.W.’s assessment of him as unprofessional and inappropriate.

The Respondent characterized his interactions with S.W. as a misunderstanding
between the two of them. I disagree. The Respondent made unfounded and, frankly, bigoted
assumptions about S.W. based on the fact of her religiously-mandated attire and, further, he
communicated those bigoted, unfounded assumptions to her. She did not misunderstand what he
was doing and she understandably found it to be discomfiting. That action, standing alone, could
merely be a lack of interpersonal sensitivity on the Respondent’ s part That action was not,
however, the only one the Respondent engaged in. He raised his voice at S.W., to include
admonishing her for wearing a burga to his office. He physically advanced on her while she was
on the phone with Mr, 7 his voice raised loud enough for Mr: - hear everything he
said through the phone. He slammed the door to the exam room containing Patient A so loudly
that Mr. eard it over the phone. The Respondent’s behavior towards S.W. was so
upsetting to her that by the time she called vo she was in tears. (T' cstimony la The

Respondent engaged in all of this conduct in front of Patient A.
