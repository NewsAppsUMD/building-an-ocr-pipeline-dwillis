so for himself but merely did so for “one of my friends.” The Respondent, however,
admitted to chatting with women through Gmail. The Respondent concluded his
interview by stating,
All I want to say to everyone is that, you know, whatever the
situation is with this—people saying staff, that, you know, I never —
jokingly. My comments were not, you know — it was just friendly,
not taken — it should not be in a sexual manner or anything like that.
I never treated patients, you know, that I felt that, you know, I
needed to go that far to say anything because I’m professional. I’ve
been in this field for 25 years, and I want to, you know, be honest

with everybody.

And I should have mentioned to [Facility C] and I should’ve
mentioned to [Facility D] that, you, know, I was terminated.
