Patient 7, a female in her 30s, has a medical history including scoliosis, a
herniated disk and arthritis. She was treated by the Respondent for
approximately three years, until 2014. Prior to an incident with the Respondent
that occurred in or around May 2014, Patient 7 had believed that he was.a very
knowledgeable and caring physician who took time to thoroughly explain her
condition and his treatment.

The Respondent did not administer injections to Patient 7; his treatment was
limited to prescribing medications, including opioid pain-killers. The Respondent
typically prescribed medications to Patient 7 on a monthly basis.

On May 28, 2013, Patient 7 presented to a Medical Group office to pick up a
prescription written by the Respondent. Patient 7 was accompanied by her five
year-old daughter.

When Patient 7 arrived at the office there was only one person (“Physician
Assistant A”) in the office other than the Respondent. Physician Assistant A
escorted Patient 7 and her daughter to an exam room to wait for the prescription
and then left the room.

The Respondent entered the exam room and inquired whether Patient 7 was
experiencing any new pain. Patient 7 replied that she had pain on her right side
that shot down the back of her leg.

The Respondent responded, “let me see” and positioned Patient 7 so that she
was standing with her back to him and facing her daughter, who was seated in a

corner of the room.
