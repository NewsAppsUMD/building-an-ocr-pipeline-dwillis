hearing should be sent to Christine A. Farrelly, Executive Director, at the Board’s address. If
such a hearing is requested, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set the

hearing to begin within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08 I, though that 30-day

formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely,
