shirt, not even to ensure that he did not accidentally touch her breasts. (T. 256-57). But the
Respondent also testified that he (b) looked underneath her shirt where the patient said there was
pain to look for bruises, (E. 15 at 32) and that he did look under her shirt (T. 261-63).

The Panel finds the Respondent's testimony concerning Patient C not credible, The
Respondent was both evasive and inconsistent. The Panel finds that the Respondent cupped
Patient C's breasts for no medical reason.

Remaining Exception concerning Patient C

‘The Respondent took exception to the ALJ's purported characterization of his examination
of Patient C as a "routine check-up and a routine lung/chest examination.” According to the
Respondent's exception, this was not a “routine check-up," because Patient C presented with chest
pain with exercise. The Respondent, however, docs not identify where in the proposed decision
the ALJ characterized the examination as a "routine check-up and a routine lung/chest
examination," if such a characterization exists. Furthermore, the Respondent also fails to explain
the significance of the exception. In any case, the AL.I’s proposed decision makes clear that Patient
C went to see the Respondent on September 10, 2009, as a resull from chest pains and difficulty
breathing in gym class. (ALJ's proposed decision at 8 and 29.) The Panel agrees with the ALJ
that the visit on September 10, 2009, was the result of Patient C's chest pains and difficulty
breathing during her gym class.

In sum, the Respondent's actions, with respect to his interactions with Patient C. on
September 10, 2009, constitute immoral and unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine,
in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(i) and (ii), and sexual misconduct, see COMAR

10.32.17.02B(4)(a),(b)(v) (sexual violation); COMAR 10.32,17.03.
