ORDER AFTER SHOW CAUSE HEARING

On July 19, 2021, Disciplinary Panel B (“Panel B”) of the Maryland State Board of
Physicians (the “Board”) and Jillian G. Goles, PA-C, entered into a consent order that, among
other things, required Ms. Goles to enroll in the Maryland Professional Rehabilitation Program
(“MPRP”) and comply with all therapy, treatment, evaluations, and screenings as directed by
MPRP. On October 26, 2022, Panel B issued a Violation of Consent Order and Notice to Show
Cause because Ms. Goles failed to comply with treatment as directed by MPRP. On January 25,
2023, Panel B held a show cause hearing where Ms. Goles had the opportunity to argue why her
license should not be subject to further discipline. Ms. Goles appeared on her own behalf and the
State was represented by the Administrative Prosecutor.

FINDINGS OF FACT

Background

On May 21, 2020, the Board received a Mandated 10-Day Report! from a medical facility
(“Facility A”)? stating that Ms. Goles’s privileges had been suspended pending the outcome of an
investigation regarding her violation of its human resources policies. On June 9, 2020, the Board

received another complaint, this from a health care provider affiliated with Facility A, alleging that

*Md. Code Ann. Health Occ. §15-103(c) requires that a hospital, related institution, an alternative health
care system or an employer report any limitation, reduction or other change of the terms of employment of
the physician assistant that might be grounds for disciplinary action under § 15-314 within 10 days.

* For confidentiality and privacy purposes, the names of the facilities involved in this case are not disclosed
in this Order.
