the Respondent to conclude that her life was at risk. He noted that few options are available to
emergency department physicians placed in that position. | | also testified that the kind.
of pain management contract discussed vy impractical in an emergency department
setting and is not part of the standard of care. Similarly, he testified that laboratory tests and
urinalysis are not typically done in an emergency department setting unless they would impact
treatment, in part because the in-hospital testing technology is less reliable than having samples
sent to a laboratory and because many substances are not detected by urinalysis. | also
dispute A contention that the Respondent failed to adequately document the reason
for prescribing methadone, noting that the medical records reflect both chronic pain and
addiction-issues, and that these are co-occurring disorders.

Accordingly, I am not persuaded that the Respondent’s prescriptions for methadone
exceeded recommendations in place at the time or required laboratory tests or urinalysis. Rather,
the Respondent’s prescriptions were a reasonable exercise of professional judgment under the
circumstances, taking into account his experience in treating patients with addiction disorders in
an emergency department setting. In addition, I conclude that the medical records adequately
reflect the Respondent’s reasons for prescribing methadone. ASE estisica, the
Respondent documented bothhfs addiction history and pain symiptoms, and I rind A.
testimony that the medical records are sufficient for care provided in an emergency department
context, I further find that the Respondent’s prescriptions for other controlled dangerous
substances, including Dexedrine, Klonopin, and tramadol, were similarly reasonable. He
credibly explained the basis for his decisions to presoribe these medications, and I found fj

mm: testimony persuasive on this point.
