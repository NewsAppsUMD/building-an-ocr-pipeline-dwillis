was completed, except for emergencies; attend a pain management course; and attend a medical
record-keeping course.

4. On September 17, 2015, the Board concluded that the Respondent had complied
with the pain-management education portion of the March 12, 2015 Consent Order and restored
the Respondent’s authority to practice pain management and prescribe CDS.

5. On April 30, 2018, the Board issued charges against the Respondent for
unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, willfully making false reports, failing to meet
the appropriate standards in the delivery of medical care, making false representations on
applications for licensure, and failing to keep adequate medical records.

6. On January 29, 2019, and ALJ conducted a hearing. On April 22, 2019, the ALJ
issued a Proposed Decision in which the ALJ issued Proposed Findings of Fact, Proposed
Conclusions of Law, and a Proposed Order. The ALJ proposed that the Board find that the
Respondent: engaged in unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, failed to meet the
appropriate standards of care, failed to comply with applicable provisions of the Pharmacy Act;
failed to keep adequate medical records; failed to comply with Pharmacy Act provisions related to
dispensing, maintaining, labeling and keeping records of dispensing CDS; failed to properly
package prescription drugs (based on a finding of fact that the Respondent dispensed drugs in
white envelopes and not in properly labeled child-resistant cap containers); and failed to provide
adequate physical security and controls for CDS. The ALJ proposed that the Respondent’s license
be suspended for six months, that he be permanently prohibited from dispensing CDS from his
office, and that the Respondent undergo an evaluation to determine whether he could safely return

to the practice of medicine.
