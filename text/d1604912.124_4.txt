5. Patient F was an 87-year-old woman with worsening monopolar depression. She
died on August 5, 2006. Her death certificate lists atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease as the
causes of death.

6. Patient G was a 76-year-old woman with degenerative ataxia not amenable to
treatment, progressive symptoms and was diagnosed with depression. She died on May 27,
2004. Her death certificate states that she died from degenerative cerebeller disorder.

ANALYSIS

The issue in this case is whether Dr. Egbert’s actions as Medical Director of FEN and his
assistance to the suicide of six members of FEN constitutes unprofessional conduct in the
practice of medicine under Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii). In the Board’s analysis, the Board
first discusses whether Dr. Egbert’s conduct was “in the practice of medicine,” second, whether
his conduct was “unprofessional,” and finally addresses miscellaneous exceptions filed by Dr.
Egbert.

I. PRACTICE OF MEDICINE
A. ALJ’s Proposed Decision and Exceptions

In her proposed decision, the ALJ found that Dr. Egbert engaged in the practice of
medicine based on his review and evaluation of applicants’ medical records. The ALJ, however,
found that Dr. Egbert’s presence and assistance in the members’ suicides was not in the practice
of medicine.

Dr. Egbert filed exceptions to the ALJ’s proposed decision’s conclusion that Dr. Egbert’s
review of the medical records was in the practice of medicine. He claims that the review of the
medical records was not within the practice of medicine. He also claimed that he had not

received notice in the charges that his review of medical records was in the practice of medicine.
