 

continued for M.P.D. several years later as she recounted the statements during her testimony.
Her proud posture diminished, her hands shook, and her voice wavered as she sheepishly
repeated the phrases and remembered the harassment. As stated previously, I do not find that the
Respondent lacked a sexualized intent when he made the statements. The Respondent had more
than ten years of experience with the Spanish language at the time he made the statements and
could not have possibly made them unintentionally. The statements cannot be construed to have
anything other than lewd intent in the context ofa breast exam. As the Respondent testified,
there would be no medical reason for the comments (Transcript Vol. II, pgs. 45-46), and
therefore they were meant to objectify and sexualize the patient’s breasts. However, even
without sexualized intent, the statements were unprofessional and immoral because they were
outside ‘the scope of the breast exam. Further, if the Respondent was so uncertain about his
ability in the Spanish language such that he believed he could accidentally sexually harass his
patients during a breast exam, it was unprofessional and immoral to attempt to speak to them in
Spanish rather than utilizing an interpreter. The Respondent’s behavior violated sections 14-
404(a)(3)(i) (immoral conduct in the practice of medicine) and 4-404(a)(3)(ii) (unprofessional
conduct in'the practice of medicine) and the Board’s sexual misconduct regulations under
