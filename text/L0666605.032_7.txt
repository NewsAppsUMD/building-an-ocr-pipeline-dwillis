the practice of respiratory care, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-5A-17(a)(3), and professional
incompetence, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-5A-17(a)(4).
SANCTION

The ALJ recommended a sanction of revocation. Ms. Hernandez argues that the sanction
of revocation was overly severe and not consistent with other cases. She contends that the
revocation was not warranted because she continued to show improvement in her clinical skills
and in interactions with her peers. The State responds that the Panel should adopt the sanction
proposed by the ALJ and revoke Ms. Hernandez’s respiratory care license.

The sanctioning guidelines for professional incompetence range from a suspension until
professional incompetence is addressed to the Board’s satisfaction to a revocation. COMAR
10.32.11.16A(4)(a). The ALJ considered whether to recommend a sanction lower than a
revocation and appreciated that a revocation could have a devastating effect on Ms. Hernandez’s
career and her ability to financially provide for her children. The ALJ declined to recommend a
lesser sanction because Ms. Hernandez had already been provided many opportunities to change
her behavior and improve her patient care and for whatever reason she was unable or unwilling to
do so. The ALJ stated that the overwhelming consideration for the proposed sanction of revocation
is that Ms. Hernandez’s conduct at the Hospital endangered patient safety on a number of
occasions. The Panel agrees with the ALJ that Ms. Hernandez was given numerous opportunities
to improve her patient care and her interactions with her colleagues and superiors. Her conduct
endangered patient safety and did not substantially improve over time while she was employed at
the Hospital. The Panel agrees that revocation is appropriate.
