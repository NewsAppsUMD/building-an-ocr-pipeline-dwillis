Dr. MacKoul again stated that he removed “forty plus” fibroids. Dr. MacKoul testified that he
estimated that he removed forty-five fibroids and relies on the pathologist for the weight.

The State’s expert, Dr. Rafi, stated that it was Dr. MacKoul’s responsibility to accurately
report the number and weight of the fibroids. Dr. MacKoul presented testimony from two experts
on this issue. According to one of his experts, Dr. Kondrup, the surgeon makes an estimate of the
weight and number of fibroids and relies on the pathologist for the exact number of fibroids and
the exact weight of the fibroids: “it is common practice to make an estimate of the number of
fibroids removed in the OR and leave the exactitude of the number and weight to the pathologist.”
His other expert, Dr. Udoff, testified that the exact number was irrelevant to the diagnosis.

The ALJ relied on Dr. Kondrup’s testimony that the onus of providing the correct data on
the weight and number of fibroids was on the pathologist. The ALJ found that there were twenty-
five fibroids. The ALJ, thus concluded that, after the pathologist determined the number and the
weight of the fibroids, Dr. MacKoul had a duty to accurately maintain Patient 3’s records, and his
documentation after receiving the pathology report of forty-five and “forty plus” fibroids was not
accurately maintaining records. The ALJ, thus, found that Dr. MacKoul failed to maintain accurate
records with respect to Patient 3.

On exceptions, Dr. MacKoul argues that there were, in fact, forty-five fibroids, and thus
the ALJ erred in finding twenty-five. Dr. MacKoul relies on a photograph taken of the fibroids.

Based on the Panel’s review of the photograph, the Panel finds that the exact number of
fibroids is difficult to establish. While inconsistent recording is troubling, the more significant
figure is the weight of the fibroids, which offers a better indication of the size of the masses than

the number of fibroids.
