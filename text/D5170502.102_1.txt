NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, Dr. Pansuriya has the right to request a full evidentiary
hearing before an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Administrative Hearings. This
request will be granted if the Board receives a written request for the hearing within TEN (10)
days of the date of this letter. Any request for a hearing should be sent to Christine A. Farrelly,
Executive Director, Maryland Board of Physicians, 4201 Patterson Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland
21215. If Dr. Pansuriya requests such a hearing, the regulations require that an Administrative
Law Judge set the hearing to begin within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08I,
though Dr. Pansuriya may waive that 30-day requirement.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel A resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely yours,

Signature on File
