The Respondent admitted to boundary violations in nis assessment. When
questioned at the hearing he stated that he admitted boundary violations as 10 Patient A, and did
not know abou or Patient B, stating “I don’t know what the final opinion is
on family care. I understand that it is common. I think it is productive, successful in my case. 1
don’t think there is anything wrong with it.” (Transcript, p. 190.)

‘Analysis

This is a rather unique scenario as the parties basically agrce on the facts. The
Respondent did not deny that he provided medical treatment iii
and that he had sexual relationships with two patients, Patient A and Patient B. In fact, these
patient relationships were revealed by the Respondent himself during his three-day analysis
session i. .

The issue that the Respondent did contest most fervently was the timing of his
relationship with Patient B. The Board contends that Patient B was an active patient of the
Respondent when the sexual relationship began, the Respondent claimed the doctor-patient
relationship terminated before the sexual relationship began.

The Respondent sought to have Dr. i: expert testimony discounted because she is an.
employee of the Board and it was upon her advice that the Board charged the Respondent.
However, I find that Dr. Fs position makes her uniquely qualified, particularly in medical
ethics, to provide expert opinion testimony regarding violations since this is her a Jarge part of
her daily profession. Her analysis and testimony were well-supported by the record, Expert
witnesses regularly testify before the OAH on behalf of the agency where they are employed.

‘Therefore, 1 find that Dr. a: testimony was worthy of consideration and weight.
