It is also settled that “the related group of offenses involving intentional dishonesty for
purposes of personal gain are crimes involving moral turpitude.” Oltman, 162 Md. App. at 486,
citing Klauber, 289 Md. at 457-58 and Walman, 280 Md. at 459-60. [citations and quotation
marks omitted]. By making materially false, fictitious, fraudulent and dishonest statements, Dr.
McLean intended to defraud and deceive Medicare, Medicaid and private health care insurers to
obtain monetary reimbursement to which he was not entitled. Dr. McLean’s willful submissions
of fraudulent bills were characterized by repeated fraud, deceit and intentional dishonesty for
purposes of his own personal gain. His crimes therefore established moral turpitude. Oltman, 162
Md. App. at 486.

Moreover, in prior decisions, the Board has concluded that health care fraud, in violation
of 18 U.S.C. §1347, is a crime of moral turpitude. See e.g., In the Matter of Douglas F. Greer,
M.D., Case Nos, 2008-0640, 2008-0653, July 23, 2009; In the Matter of Ehigiator Akhigbhe,
M.D., Case No. 2010-0770. In prior decisions, the Board also concluded that knowingly and
willfully making a materially false, fictitious and fraudulent statement and representation in
connection with the delivery of health care benefits, items and services, in violation of 18 U.S.C.
§1035, is a crime of oral turpitude. See e.g. In the Matter of Martin R. McLaren, M.D., Case No.
2008-0811, July 23, 2009; see also Akhigbe, M.D., supra.

In addition, the Board has concluded in multiple prior decisions that defrauding health
plans constitutes a crime of moral turpitude. See e.g., In the Matter of Oparaugo I. Udebiuwa,
Case No. 2006-0851, October 24, 2007; In the Matter of Roman Ostrovsky, Case No, 2006-0522,
June 12, 2007; In the Matter of James An Nguyen, M.D., Case No. 2004-0638, February 1, 2006;

see also Akhigbe, M.D., supra.
