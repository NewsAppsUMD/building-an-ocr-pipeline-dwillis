5. Dr. Raley did not appeal his conviction within the time prescribed by law and the guilty
plea and conviction have not been set aside.

DISCUSSION

Pursuant to COMAR 10.32.02.07E(2), Dr. Raley had the opportunity to respond to the
order to show cause, in writing, to address the following limited issues: “(a) Lack of conviction or
plea; (b) Whether the crime is one involving moral turpitude; (c) Misidentity of the respondent
with the defendant in the criminal matter; and (d) Other relevant issues, if any, other than
mitigation.” In his response, Dr. Raley does not dispute that he pled guilty to a crime involving
moral turpitude and does not dispute that his license should be revoked. Dr. Raley asks the Board
to refrain from imposing a permanent revocation in this case.

Under Health Occ. §14-404(b)(2), a disciplinary panel has the obligation and discretion to
determine what types of crimes are crimes involving moral turpitude for licensing and disciplinary
purposes. “[I]t is settled that whatever else [moral turpitude] may mean . . . a crime in which an
intent to defraud is an essential element is a crime involving moral turpitude. It is also settled that
the related group of offenses involving intentional dishonesty for purposes of personal gain are
crimes involving moral turpitude[.]” Attorney Grievance Comm'n of Md. v. Walman, 280 Md. 453,
459-60 (1977). “{I]n the context of a licensing board’s review of the conduct of its licensee, the
concept of moral turpitude is rather broad.” Oltman v. Maryland State Bd. Of Physicians, 162 Md.
App. 457, 483 (2005).

‘Determining whether an individual has been convicted of a crime involving moral
turpitude ‘necessarily begins with an examination of the criminal statute itself.” Burke v.
Maryland Bd. of Physicians, 250 Md. App. 334, 348 (2021) (quoting Walman, 280 Md. at 460).
“Tf the criminal statute does not establish moral turpitude on its face, then the analysis ‘hinges on

the facts present in the individual case at hand.’” Jd. (quoting Walman, 280 Md. at 460). Maryland
