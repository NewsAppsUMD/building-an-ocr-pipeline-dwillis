7. By letter dated May 17, 2022, the Board notified the Respondent that it had
initiated an investigation of this matter. The Board provided the Respondent with a copy
of the Report and requested that she address the matter in a written response.

8. By letter dated June 1, 2022, the Respondent responded, alleging that the
Facility’s actions against her were the result of a “systematic pattern of bullying, lack of
interest in patient and clinical care and elaborate efforts spent in pursuing personal agendas
by any diabolical means, particularly by several senior members of the staff.”

9. The Respondent claimed that the Facility’s suspension of her privileges was
retaliatory and that she was “targeted, by this prevalent manipulative highlevel (sic)
attitude, the motivation being the same desperate ‘greed thinking’ that lead (sic) to
thousands of inappropriate billing codes per year.”

10. | The Respondent also addressed allegations that she failed to note critical
findings in a January 26, 2022, CT report and failed to document communicating with
ordering providers from the emergency department (“ED”), which caused the Facility to
summarily suspend her clinical privileges. The Respondent acknowledged that she failed
to document a critical finding in the CT report, stating, “I chose to move forward without
the ‘critical results tab.”

11. | The Respondent further stated that she was busy on the afternoon of January
26, 2022, and that “[w]hile adherence with the rules and policies is absolutely a preference,
sometimes, as physicians we make decisions towards acting in patient interests over doting

(sic) the Is and the Ts and this was one of the moments.”
