Case No.: 2016-0465A.
License No.: D37592

Dear Dr. Babaturk and Mr. Kao:

On February 25, 2016, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t II, § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014
Repl. Vol.). On March 9, 2016, Dr. Babaturk was given an opportunity to attend a hearing before
Disciplinary Panel A to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. Dr. Babaturk
attended the hearing on that date. The State was represented by Michael Kao, Assistant Attorney
General, Administrative Prosecutor. Both parties presented extensive oral arguments at the show
cause hearing.

After considering these arguments at the hearing and the investigative file, Disciplinary
Panel A determined that it would continue the summary suspension imposed on February 25,
2016. Disciplinary Panel A thus will not lift the summary suspension order. The arguments
submitted, together with Dr. Babaturk’s presentation and responses to the Panel’s questions,
when considered in the light of the investigative findings in the file, persuade Disciplinary Panel
A that there exists a substantial risk of serious harm to the public health, safety or welfare in Dr.
Babaturk’s continued practice. Disciplinary Panel A, through its counsel, advised Dr. Babaturk
of this decision orally on the hearing date.
