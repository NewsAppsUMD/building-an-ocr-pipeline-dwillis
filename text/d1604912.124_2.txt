not being properly treated and he advised the applicant to seek further pain management from
her physician. Dr. Egbert also noted that FEN accepted applicants with exclusively
psychological/psychiatric issues. For psychological and psychiatric cases, Dr. Egbert could refer
the applicant to a mental health specialist, if he believed that his own determination would be
inadequate.

After FEN accepted the applicant as a member to FEN, that member would receive a
copy of the Final Exit book, which detailed how to commit suicide using helium gas to hasten
death by releasing helium into an airtight bag/hood over the member’s head. FEN assigned each
member one or two “Exit Guides” to aid the member’s suicide. The Exit Guide talks with the
member, rehearses the suicide with the member, ensures all the paperwork is completed, attends
the member’s suicide, and holds the member’s hands to comfort the member and to prevent the
member from involuntarily displacing the bag during the suicide. After the member’s death, the
Exit Guide removes the helium tanks and bag, leaves, and disposes of the suicide paraphernalia.
The suicide paraphernalia is immediately removed from the suicide location to prevent the cause
of death from being determined and listed on the death certificate and to hinder police
investigations into the circumstances of the death. Each member plans in advance the person
who will “discover” the body and that person either calls 911 or the family physician. After the
suicide, the Exit Guide contacts the “discoverer” to find out what occurred after the death was
reported.

It is undisputed that Dr. Egbert participated in six suicides in the State of Maryland as
either a Senior Exit Guide or as the members’ only Exit Guide. Dr. Egbert reviewed their
applications and medical records and recommended accepting them as members. Dr. Egbert

attended their suicide rehearsals. He held each member’s hands and talked to him or her. Each
