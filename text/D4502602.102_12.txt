16. Shortly after their encounter at CVS, the Patient stated the Respondent began
treating her as a self-described friend, “I really never started seeing him as a patient; he
started treating me as a friend, like he never charged me.” The Patient stated that she saw
the Respondent at his office on occasion while he was treating her as a “friend,” and that
sometimes he wrote prescriptions for her if she “needed prescriptions.”

the Respondent watched television together at each other’s houses, “started running into
each other at social settings,” and “started going out to dinner, we would see, you know,
each other just casually.” The Patient described the relationship with the Respondent as “a
friend, we are just friends...there’s no emotional, sexual and there hasn’t been any sex
between Dr. Drachenberg and myself, Haroldo, at this time...it’s platonic.” The Patient
denied reporting to the Psychiatrist that she and the Respondent had a sexual relationship,
stating the Psychiatrist, “just kind of took that and ran with it...I tried to tell him and he
wouldn’t listen to me.”

the Respondent purchased gifts and other souvenirs for her on the trip.
