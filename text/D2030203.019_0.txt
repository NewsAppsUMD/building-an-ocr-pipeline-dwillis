Re: Surrender of License to Practice Medicine
Robert Gereige, M.D. License Number: D20302
Case Number: 2219-0114

Dear Dr. Freas and Members of the Disciplinary Panel B,

Please be advised that, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. (“Health Occ.”) §14-403 (2014
Repl. Vol. & 2017 Supp.), I have decided to SURRENDER my license to practice medicine in the State
of Maryland, License Number D20302, effective immediately. I understand that upon surrender of my
license, I may not give medical advice or treatment to any individual, with or without compensation, and
cannot prescribe medications or otherwise engage in the practice of medicine in the State of Maryland as
it is defined in the Maryland Medical Practice Act (the “Act”), Health Occ. §§ 14-101 et seg. and other
applicable laws. In other words, as of the effective date of this Letter of Surrender, I understand that the
surrender of my license means that I am in the same position as an unlicensed individual in the State of
Maryland.

I understand that this Letter of Surrender is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT, and upon Disciplinary
Panel B’s (“Panel B”) acceptance, becomes a FINAL ORDER of Panel B of the Maryland State Board
of Physicians (the “Board”).

I acknowledge that the Board initiated an investigation that found the following: On July 31,
2018, I completed the 2018 license renewal application. In this application, I checked that I had
completed the Criminal History Records Check (“CHRC”), but in fact I did not complete the process.
On December 13, 2018, the Board notified me that it had not received the CHRC results and offered me
ten days to provide the requested information. I have decided to surrender my license to practice
medicine in the State of Maryland to avoid further investigation and prosecution of these allegations and
because I no longer wish to pursue renewal of my Maryland license, since I do not reside in the USA
and I have not practiced medicine since 1998. I recognize that for all purposes relevant to medical
licensure that these allegations shall be treated as proven and that these allegations support a conclusion
that I violated Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(42), (“Fails to submit to a criminal history records check under
§14-308.1 of this title.”)

I wish to make it clear that I have voluntarily, knowingly and freely chosen to submit this Letter
of Surrender to avoid the issuance of charges and prosecution of the aforementioned allegations. I do
