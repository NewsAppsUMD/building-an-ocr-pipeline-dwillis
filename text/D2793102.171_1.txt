licensure, Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(36). The Board also charged Dr. Hill with being disciplined
by a licensing or disciplinary authority for an act that would be grounds for disciplinary action in
Maryland, Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(21). The grounds for discipline in Maryland include: Health
Occ, § 14-404(a)(3)(ii), unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine; § 14-404(a)(19),
grossly overutilizes health care services; § 14-404(a)(22), fails to meet appropriate standards for
the delivery of quality medical or surgical care; and § 14-404(a)(33), fails to cooperate with a
lawful investigation.

The case was referred to the Office of Administrative Hearings (“OAH”) for a hearing
before an Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”). On May 14, 2020, the State filed a motion in
limine to, among other things, exclude evidence from Dr. Hill collaterally attacking the findings
of the Virginia Board related to notice and sufficiency of the evidence. Dr. Hill filed an
opposition on May 29, 2020. On June 1, 2020, after an oral presentation by the parties, the ALJ
granted the motion and excluded such evidence. On June 5, 2020, the evidentiary hearing was
held before the ALJ at OAH. At the hearing, the parties jointly introduced 10 exhibits. The
State presented testimony from a Board health policy analyst and Dr. Hill testified on his own
behalf. At the hearing, Dr. Hill conceded to the allegations in the Charges and the ALJ,
therefore, accepted the allegations of the Charges as proven.

On July 27, 2020, the ALJ issued a proposed decision concluding that Dr. Hill violated
Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(1), (3)(ii), (19), (21), (22), (33), and (36). The ALJ recommended a
sanction of an indefinite suspension of Dr. Hill’s medical license for a period not less than
twelve months and a fine of $5,000. Dr. Hill filed exceptions with Board Disciplinary Panel A
(“Panel A”), and the State filed a response to the exceptions. On November 4, 2020, the Board

held an exceptions hearing remotely via the Zoom platform.
