RE: Surrender of License to Practice Medicine
License Number: D32772
Case Number: 2217-0004

Dear Members of the Board:

Please be advised that I have decided to SURRENDER my license to practice medicine
in the State of Maryland, License Number D32772, effective immediately. I understand that
upon surrender of my license, I may not give medical advice or treatment to any individual, with
or without compensation, and cannot prescribe medications or otherwise engage in the practice
of medicine in the State of Maryland as it is defined in Maryland Medical Practice Act (the
“Act”), Md. Health Occ. Code Ann., § 14-101 ef seg. (2014 Repl. Vol.) and other applicable
laws. In other words, as of the effective date of this Letter of Surrender, I understand that the
surrender of my license means that I am in the same position as an unlicensed individual in the
State of Maryland.

I understand that this Letter of Surrender is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT and on the Board’s
acceptance, becomes a FINAL ORDER of the Board.

My decision to permanently surrender my license to practice medicine in the State of
Maryland has been prompted by the Board’s investigation into my compliance with Continuing
Medical Education (CME) requirements. The Board’s random audit of my 2016 license renewal
application revealed that although I represented that I met the Board’s CME requirements, I did
not actually complete the required (50) hours of CME credits.

I have decided to permanently surrender my license to practice medicine in the State of
Maryland to avoid sanction from having attested in my license renewal application to
completeing my fifty (50) hours (CME) requirements, when I had not. If an investigation ensued,
the Board would or may have pursued disciplinary charges under Md. Health Occ. Code § 14-
404 (a)(3)(ii) and (36).
