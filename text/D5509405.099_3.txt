refused to discuss anything further about his benzodiazepine use and refused to undergo

Ill. SUBSEQUENT BOARD INVESTIGATION AND FINDINGS

9. By letter dated August 14, 2018, the Board requested that the Respondent
provide a response to the above complaint.

10. The Respondent provided a written response to the Board in a letter dated
August 24, 2018. The Respondent acknowledged that since 2004, several physicians had
prescribed benzodiazepines for him to treat medical conditions and he did “on a few
occasions obtain benzodiazepines pursuant to [his] own prescription.” The Respondent
claimed that his objectivity when self-prescribing was not compromised because he was
using this medication for nearly fifteen years and only self-prescribed in “emergency”
situations when he was not able to obtain prescriptions from his physicians. The
Respondent admitted that he “did not create a separate medical record for [himself]
related to those [self-prescribing] instances.” The Respondent asserted that his self-
prescribing of controlled substances was not inconsistent with American Medical
Association guidelines on self-prescribing. The Respondent further stated that he does
“not suffer from any addictions or engage in the habitual use of any controlled dangerous
substance, and am not otherwise habitually intoxicated.”

11. Pursuant to its investigation, the Board obtained the Respondent’s medical

records from two physicians whom the Respondent identified as his treating physicians.
