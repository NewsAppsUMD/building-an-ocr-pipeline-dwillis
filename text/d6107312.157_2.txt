In furtherance of the investigation, the Board’s investigator contacted
relevant witnesses and obtained documents, including records from
Practice A, MPHP, and programs. The investigation revealed the
following:

After being referred to an in-patient center (“Center A”) by MPHP, the
Respondent checked herself out prior to completing the program.

The Respondent was subsequently readmitted, but was then discharged
for noncompliance with the center's rules and for possession of
unapproved controlled dangerous substances.

The Respondent then entered into the in-patient program at a different in-
patient center (“Center B”), which subsequently referred her to a more
intensive program (“Center C”).

The Respondent submitted a written response to the Complaint, in which
she stated that in the days leading up to her suspension from Practice A,
she had taken “some old prescribed valium for several nights to try to
sleep.”

The Respondent's personnel file from Practice A also documents several
related instances of unprofessional conduct and treatment errors
consistent with impairment, including entering the wrong dosage on
prescriptions and ordering tests but then forgetting that she had ordered
them.

The file also contains documented admissions from the Respondent

stating she is attempting to wean herself off opioids.
