 

Mr. Gbadamosi further excepts to the ALJ’s recommended sanction of a one-year
suspension and the imposition of a $25,000.00 civil fine as too high in contrast to sanctions in
similar Board cases, Contrary to Mr. Gbadamosi’s contentions, the cases he cites do not involve
similarly situated individuals, Rather, they involve consent orders negotiated by the parties to
resolve pending charges, single instances of misrepresentation regarding the completion of
continuing medical education credits, a single instance of deception based on failure to disclose a
criminal conviction from 1988, and the unlicensed practice of medicine. Mr. Gbadamosi’s
violations, however, involved numerous instances of deception and misrepresentation concerning
problematic events that occurred in recent years. He deliberately and repeatedly provided false
answers on multiple applications, omitted the unflattering truth about his criminal and

“employment history in an effort to hide his past, committed various factually discrete offenses
that formed the basis of the charges against him, and took no responsibility for his willful
misrepresentations before the ALJ or the panel.

The panel does not find credible that Mr. Gbadamosi was unaware of the requirement to
disclose his criminal conviction on licensure and hospital credentialing applications, or that he
had no knowledge of complaints about his work and behavior and an ongoing hospital
investigation. The panel denies his exception and rejects his continuing efforts to minimize his
violations,
