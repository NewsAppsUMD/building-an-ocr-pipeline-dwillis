bottle; the label on the prescription bottle is partially worn off and does not show the
patient’s name.

10. Board staff conducted an under-oath interview of Individual B on
November 7, 2018. Individual B stated that he began working for the Respondent in or
around April 2018 and that thereafter, tensions arose because the Respondent was failing
to create patient charts and was not submitting bills for services. Individual B confirmed
that the Respondent struck him in the face in or around August 2018 at the practice
location after going through his cell phone and discovering text messages between him,
Individual A and a family member of the Respondent in which they discussed a possible
intervention regarding the Respondent’s alcohol use. Since the incident, Individual B
stated that he has not returned to the Respondent’s practice. Individual B also reported
that the Respondent admitted to him that she had engaged in an unprofessional
relationship with a patient. Individual B also noted that one morning when he arrived at
the office, he found the Respondent asleep on an examination bed and noticed two
“alcohol bottles” sitting on a nearby table. Individual B stated that the Respondent
explained to him that she had been working on completing charts the previous night.

Respondent’s medical record from a physician who provided medical care to the
Respondent.
