problematic testimony of Dr. C. Browne, which was based on the incorrect assumption that the
procedure in question was a medically induced abortion.

“When two experts offer conflicting opinions, the trier of fact must evaluate the
testimony of both experts and decide which opinion, if either, to accept.” Blaker v. State Board
of Chiropractic Examiners, 123 Md. App. 243, 259 (1998). In considering the testimony of all
three experts, the Panel rejects Dr. C. Browne’s conclusions regarding the standard of care and
accepts the testimony of Dr. Rafi and Dr. M. Browne. Dr. C. Browne’s opinions were not
sufficiently founded on the specific facts of this case and, therefore, his conclusion that Dr.
Alexander did not violate the Act was unjustified. In contrast, Dr. Rafi’s and Dr. M. Browne’s
conclusions were founded on the specific facts of this case and supported by the ACOG practice
bulletin. Dr. Alexander’s exception is denied.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Based on the foregoing factual findings, Panel B concludes that Dr. Alexander failed to
meet the appropriate standards as determined by peer review for the delivery of quality medical
care, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(22). The Panel also concludes that Dr. Alexander is
guilty of unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-
404(a)(3)(ii).

SANCTION

Pursuant to Health Occ. § 14-404(a), a disciplinary panel is authorized to sanction a
