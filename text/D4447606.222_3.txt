7. Through an Order dated September 29, 2017, the Board terminated the non-
permanent conditions that were imposed under the April 29, 2014 Consent Order and
continued the above-noted permanent conditions, to which the Respondent is still subject.

The Complaint

8. The Board initiated an investigation of the Respondent after reviewing a
complaint, dated February 2, 2022, from a health occupations licensee (the “Complainant”)
who owns and operates the Facility. The Complainant stated that he formerly employed
the Respondent to provide medical services at the Facility. The Complainant stated that
the Respondent has an alcohol problem and that his behavior toward patients “was often
unprofessional and rude.” The Complainant also stated that the Respondent kept poor
medical records and at times failed to keep medical records.

Board Investigation

9. As part of its investigation, the Board obtained the Respondent’s human
resources (“HR”) file from the Facility and interviewed the Complainant, the Facility’s
office manager and the Respondent.

The Respondent’s HR file

10. The Respondent’s HR file states that the Facility hired the Respondent to be
the Facility’s medical director in or around December 2014, and that the Respondent
resigned from his position in January 2022. The file indicates that the Facility counseled
the Respondent on several occasions for recordkeeping deficiencies and deficiencies in his

professional image and attitude toward patients.
