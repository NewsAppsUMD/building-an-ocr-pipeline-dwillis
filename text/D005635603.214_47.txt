perioperative director to testify.> At the evidentiary hearing before the ALJ, the Respondent had
the opportunity to subpoena any witness he felt would help his position. OAH has extensive
procedures furnishing parties with the power to subpoena witnesses. Upon request of a party,
OAH may issue subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses. COMAR
28.02.01.14A. Likewise, an ALJ may authorize the issuance of a subpoena pursuant to §
9-1605(c)(1) of the State Government Article. Under § 9-1605(d)(2), an ALJ may apply to a
circuit court to enforce a subpoena. Under COMAR 28.02.01.14F, “Ifa person fails to comply
with a properly served subpoena, at the request of an administrative law judge, the Office may
apply to the appropriate circuit court for an order to show cause why the person should not be
committed to jail for refusal to comply with a subpoena.” Therefore, even if due process rights
attached to evidentiary hearings could be tied to the Board’s actions during the investigation
stage, the record does not indicate that the Respondent’s evidentiary hearing process rights were
affected by the Board’s actions during the investigation stage. The Respondent’s exceptions are
denied, and the Panel does not adopt the ALJ’s proposed decision.
IV. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Panel B concludes that the order, issued on July 2, 2021, pursuant to § 10-226(c)(2) of the
State Government Article, which summarily suspended the Respondent’s license to practice
medicine in Maryland was imperatively required to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.

members present,‘ hereby
> During closing arguments, however, the ALJ stated that, because the transcript of the interview
of the perioperative director was on the computer disk (Respondent’s Ex. 3) containing the

Board’s investigative file, “Then it is in evidence.” (T. 443.)
§ Panel B had a quorum at the time it voted.
