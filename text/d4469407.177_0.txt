ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE
Disciplinary Panel B (“Panel B”) of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the
“Board”) hereby SUMMARILY SUSPENDS the license of Andrea N. Bailey, M.D. (the
“Respondent”) to practice medicine in the State of Maryland, License Number D44694.
Panel B takes such action pursuant to its authority under Md. Code Ann., State
Gov't ("State Gov't") § 10-226(c)(2) (2014 Repl. Vol. and 2016 Supp.), concluding that
the public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires emergency action. Panel B
bases its conclusion on the following investigative findings.
INVESTIGATIVE FINDINGS
Following receipt of information regarding Respondent's arrest in Virginia for
“practicing medicine without a license”, the Board opened an investigation. Respondent
had been self-prescribing non-controlled medications and filling them in Maryland and
Virginia; however, on the last occasion, when Respondent picked up the prescription in
Virginia, the pharmacist was concerned and brought her concern to the attention of the
local criminal authorities. Panel B obtained further investigatory information that
Respondent wrote the prescriptions in the name of a fictitious patient, had multiple
prescription bottles, multiple blank prescriptions pads from other doctors, and alcohol in

her automobile.
