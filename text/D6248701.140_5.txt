the Respondent on or about May 13, 2019. The Respondent wrote “Hi” to the Patient on
or about May 20, 2019, but the Patient did not respond.
D. Interview of the Patient

15. As part of its investigation, Board staff interviewed the Patient under oath
on or about August 19, 2019.

16. During the interview, the Patient explained that the Respondent was her
treating psychiatrist while she was admitted to the Hospital. The Patient said that, at the
time, she felt “lucky” to have the Respondent as her psychiatrist because, in her view, he
“alluded to [the Patient] as being sort of a special patient.” The Respondent offered to
exchange personal cell phone numbers just before she was discharged from the Hospital
so that the Patient could update him on her status. The Patient agreed because she
thought this provided her “a beeline to a doctor who’s been there for me.”

| 17. The Patient explained that she first sent a message to the Respondent a few
days after being discharged from the Hospital. She said that the two communicated by
text message every few days. Eventually, according to the Patient, the Respondent asked
to see the Patient in person at the Hospital.

18. The Patient described the first in-person meeting with the Respondent after
being discharged as “a lot about him” and not about the Patient. The Respondent asked
to continue that conversation and suggested a restaurant at a nearby hotel. The Patient
agreed, “thinking it would be nice to have a meal [and] a nice conversation[.]” The
Patient learned that the Respondent lived at that hotel during the week. Afterwards, the
Respondent invited the Patient to return to the hotel on a different day “and enjoy the

amenities[.]”
