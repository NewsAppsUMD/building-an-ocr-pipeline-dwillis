By letter dated August 29, 2019, the Board directed Mr. Taylor to appear at a Board-
approved program on September 12, 2019, for an intake evaluation and to schedule a full
examination. The Board’s letter further advised Mr. Taylor that his failure or refusal to submit to
an evaluation would, under Health Oce. § 14-402(c), be prima facie evidence of his inability to
practice competently. Mr. Taylor did not appear for the September 12, 2019 evaluation.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Panel A finds Mr. Taylor in default based upon his failure to appear at the OAH for the
prehearing conference scheduled for July 28, 2020, See State Gov’t § 10-210(4). Based upon the
foregoing findings of fact, Panel A concludes that Mr. Taylor is guilty of unprofessional conduct
in the practice of radiography, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-5B-14(a)(3); is professionally,
physically or mentally incompetent, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-5B-14(a)(4); and failed to
cooperate with a lawful investigation conducted by the Board or a disciplinary panel, in violation
of Health Occ, § 14-5B-14(a)(26).

SANCTION
Panel A adopts the sanction recommended by the ALJ, which is to revoke Mr. Taylor’s
license to practice as a radiographer.
ORDER
It is, on the affirmative vote of a majority of the quorum of Panel A, hereby
ORDERED that Ronnie Taylor’s license to practice radiography in Maryland (License

No. R04361) is REVOKED; and it is further

ORDERED that this is a public document. See Health Occ. §§ 1-607, 14-411.1(b)(2) and

Gen, Prov. § 4-333(b)(6). Signature on File
