adequate medical records. On or about October 22, 2020, the peer reviewers submitted
their reports to the Board.

18. In their initial reports the two physician peer reviewers concurred that the
Respondent failed to meet appropriate standards for the delivery of quality medical care,
in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(22), for five out of nine patients (identified on the
peer review reports as Patients 2, 3, 4, 5 and 8). The peer reviewers further concurred that
the Respondent failed to keep adequate medical records, in violation of Health Occ.
§ 14-404(a)(40), for three out of nine patients (identified on the peer review reports as
Patients 1, 5, and 8).

19. After the Respondent submitted to the Board a detailed response to the peer
reviewers’ initial reports, along with the voluminous medical records (referenced supra
4] 16), the written response and additional medical records were provided to the peer
reviewers to ascertain what, if any, impact the additional information had on their
opinion. In their supplemental reports the peer reviewers reported that the additional
information did have an impact on some of their opinions, but concurred that the
Respondent still failed to meet appropriate standards for the delivery of quality medical
care, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(22), for four out of nine patients (identified
on the peer review reports as Patients 2, 3, 4, and 8). The peer reviewers further
concurred that the Respondent still failed to keep adequate medical records, in violation
of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(40), for one out of nine patients (identified on the peer review

reports as Patient 5).
