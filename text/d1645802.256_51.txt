The Respondent gave Patient I medication on a compassionate basis including oxycodone and
Valium. Patient I visited the Respondent a second time and was told the same thing as was told
on his first visit, to schedule an appointment with Dr. Ghorbani, and was given additional
prescriptions for oxycodone and Valium.

Patient I returned to the Respondent’s practice having never seen Dr. Ghorbani. He was
accepted into the practice. The patient had a spinal cord stimulator implanted that was causing
inflammation and pain. Although Patient I was referred to Johns Hopkins to have the device
reimplanted, there is no documentation to indicate that the patient ever followed through on the
recommendation.

The Respondent continued to treat Patient I with SOAs even though he had been on these
medications for many months, He was not transitioned to LAOs and SAOs which would have
been used only for breakthrough pain.

The Respondent did not utilize any other modalities of treatment that would allow Patient
I’s opiate medication to be decreased and eventually discontinued.

Patient J

Patient J was seen at XpressMedCare on August 21, 2012 for lower back pain. A year
earlier, she had spinal fusion surgery that was unsuccessful and more recently was involved in an
automobile accident on July 31, 2012 that exacerbated her pain. She was referred to a surgeon to
correct the initial back surgery but eventually was seen by Dr. Lauerman at Georgetown Medical
Center. After declining further surgery, Patient J underwent physical therapy which she claimed
caused her additional pain rather than relief, During the fall of 2012 through early 2013, Patient /
J was treated by the Respondent and given prescriptions for oxycodone Xanax and Ambien.

During this time, the patient was urine screened. No LAO’s were prescribed during this period
