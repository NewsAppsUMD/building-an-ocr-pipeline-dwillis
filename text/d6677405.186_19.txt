The Respondent, who sat in the chair vacated by Patient 7, pulled down Patient
7’s pants and underwear, exposing her buttocks. The Respondent used both
hands to press and palpate both sides of Patient 7’s lower back and then gripped
and squeezed her buttocks with his thumbs.

The Respondent moved both hands to cup Patient 7‘s buttocks and moved his
thumbs between her legs so that they were very close to Patient 7’s vagina, but
not touching it.

The Respondent then began to pull up Patient 7’s underpants and pants but
Patient 7, who had become increasingly uncomfortable, especially because her
daughter was in the room, pulled them up herself.

Before leaving the exam room, the Respondent stated that he was going to order
an x-ray because Patient 7’s condition might be getting worse.

A chaperone was not in the room at any time during the Respondent's
examination of Patient 7 described above or on any other occasion that the
Respondent examined Patient 7.

On May 30, 2013, Patient 7 contacted Physician Assistant A and requested an
explanation of the examination the Respondent had performed on her. Physician
Assistant A noted in Patient 7’s record that she (Physician Assistant A) reviewed
the lumbar spine physical exam with Patient 7, but that Patient 7 was “not
satisfied.”

Patient 7 went on-line and viewed videos of a lumbar spinal examination. Patient
7 saw that the Respondent's examination of her was totally different than the

exams she had viewed.
