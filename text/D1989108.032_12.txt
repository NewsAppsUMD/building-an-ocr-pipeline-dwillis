conducted an independent investigation to investigate the allegations and referred Dr. Dabela for
an independent evaluation to determine his competency. After the considering the entirety of the
record, the Panel finds that the State has met its burden of proving that Dr. Dabela is mentally

incompetent by a preponderance of the evidence.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Based on the findings of fact and discussion of Dr. Dabela’s exceptions, as set forth
above, Disciplinary Panel B concludes that Dr. Dabela is professionally, physically, or mentally
incompetent, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(4), and that the summary suspension was
proper because the public health, safety, or welfare imperatively required emergency action
pursuant to State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2).

SANCTION

The ALJ recommended that the Panel revoke Dr. Dabela’s license. Dr. Dabela takes
exception to the ALJ’s recommended sanction and argues that his license should not be revoked
until an updated neuropsychological evaluation is performed to determine if there is additional
decline and to monitor the efficacy of the treatment and recommendations suggested by Dr. M.
Dr. Dabela also argues that not allowing him the opportunity to practice medicine with the
accommodations recommended by Dr. M is illegal and in violation of the Americans with
Disabilities Act and represents age discrimination.

The Panel’s responsibility is to protect the public by ensuring that Dr. Dabela is
competent to practice medicine safely. Even if Dr. Dabela strictly followed the recommendations
listed by Dr. M, both Dr. R and Dr. S opined that the recommendations would not be sufficient to
allow him to safely practice medicine. The Panel accepts the opinions of Dr. R and Dr. S and

agrees with the ALJ that revocation is appropriate.
