patient(s) from the practice; curtailing the prescribing of certain controlled substances
where there were negative UDS findings; titrating or discontinuing the medications;
utilizing pill counts; requiring more frequent visits with further monitoring or employing
other forms of heightened surveillance; or referring patients for detoxification, addiction
therapy or mental health/substance abuse counseling. In at least one case, the
Respondent inappropriately provided early refills for opioid medications. Although the
Respondent noted that he referred patients for detoxification or counseling, he did not
note whether the patients followed through with such directives.

12. The Panel also alleges that the Respondent's actions, as described
herein, constitute, in whole or in part, a violation of Condition Three (3) of the Order
Terminating Suspension and Imposing Probation, dated May 1, 2013, in that the
Respondent failed to comply with the Act.

13. Examples of these deficiencies are set forth in the following patient
summaries.
