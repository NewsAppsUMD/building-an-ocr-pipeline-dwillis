The State’s expert, Dr. Rafi, testified that Vicryl sutures, and absorbable sutures in general,
have met the standard of care since, at least, 1996, because they made a second surgery
unnecessary. Dr. MacKoul’s expert, Dr. Kondrup, disagreed. He opined that both Vicryl and
Ethibond met the standard of care. Dr. Kondrup testified that absorbable sutures could dissolve
too quickly leading to VCD. However, the ALJ noted that Dr. Kondrup could not provide another
example of the use of a new procedure that requires a second surgery meeting the standard of care.
Dr. Kondrup himself did not use Ethibond sutures, because doing so would require a second
surgery.

Ultimately Dr. MacKoul discontinued his use of Ethibond non-absorbable sutures. He
explained, “I’m using Vicryl now. Vicryl’s the standard, right. . . . Its the standard.” Later at the
hearing Dr. MacKoul claimed that “it’s really difficult to identify what is the standard of care now
for closure of a vaginal cuff.”

The ALJ noted that Dr. MacKoul downplayed the risks of the second surgery and explained
that the consent form provided to the patients before the second surgery undermined Dr.
MacKoul’s assertion. The consent form listed the following risks: “infection, bleeding, injury to
bowel, bladder, uterers, pelvic pain, adhesions, pain with intercourse, and difficulty with sexual
function.” Prop. Dec. at 49. The second surgery involved more than merely removing the sutures.
It also required the placement of a Vicryl stitch to stem bleeding, preparations similar to the first
surgery, and insertion of an IV (for sedation). The ALJ also found that the literature provided by
Dr. MacKoul on hysterectomies described the use of absorbable sutures but not the use of non-
absorbable sutures. Considering these factors as well as the expert testimony, the ALJ concluded

that using non-absorbable sutures was not within the standard of care.
