the prescribed regimen. The Respondent typically ordered urine drug
testing at a patient's initial visit but rarely, if at all, at subsequent visits;
Increased dosages of already excessive and medically unjustified
opioids in the absence of an assessment of whether the lower dosage
had improved function or better pain control as compared to the
patient's baseline presentation. Such increases in dosages are a
potential danger to patient safety; and

The Respondent uses an electronic medical record system to
document her care. The Respondent's documentation was extensive
and repetitive making it difficult to discern what care the Respondent
actually provided at each visit. Despite the repetitive nature of the
Respondent's notes, she failed on occasion to document pertinent
information such as her treatment rationale for changing opioids,

adding medications and changing dosages.

13. In addition to the general practice deficiencies summarized in J 12, the Expert

found the following patient-specific deficiencies as indicated:

a.

The Respondent ignored “red flags” of abuse or diversion such as
patient reports of running out of medication early, theft of prescription
or medication; Patient 2, Patient 3 and Patient 6

The Respondent increased dosages of opioids even after documenting
that patient's pain was controlled with a lower dosage and/or without
significant change in physical examination, patient function and/or

diagnostic testing; Patient 2, Patient 3, Patient 4 and Patient 6
