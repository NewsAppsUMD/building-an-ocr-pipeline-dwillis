 

SANCTION

Dr. Gianelle further excepts to the ALJ’s recommended sanction and requests dismissal
of the charges against him. Panel A also denies this exception and adopts the ALJ’s proposed
sanction with some modifications, as set forth below. The Panel has considered applicable
mitigating and aggravating factors in its regulations. COMAR 10.32.02.09B. Dr. Gianelle does
not have a prior disciplinary history with the Board and cooperated with the disciplinary panel
proceedings. COMAR 10.32.02.09B(5)(a) and (c). With respect to his self-reporting and
admission of his sexual relationship with Individual A to the Board in January 2019, COMAR
10.32.02.09B(5)(b), the Panel notes that he did so based partially on the public filing of
Individual A’s EEOC complaint against him in October 2018. Aggravating factors in this case
include not only the combination of factually discrete offenses adjudicated in a single action, but
Dr. Gianelle’s deliberate and reckless commission of repeated sexual offenses over two years,
and the potential for harm to Individual A. COMAR 10.32.02.09B(6)(b), (c), and (e).

The Panel is especially concerned that Dr. Gianelle’s justifications for his sexual
transgressions in this case were not accompanied by any meaningful sense of personal
responsibility for or insight into his behavior. He rationalized his immoral and unprofessional
conduct and minimized the potential risks that his conduct posed for Individual A. His excuses
reveal a profound lack of understanding about sexual boundary abuses generally and betray a
troubling dearth of basic knowledge of and appreciation for the crucial physician-patient
boundaries that apply to his own practice as a licensed physician in this State. To remediate his
ethical and professional deficiencies and deter any future sexual misconduct or adventures by Dr.
Gianelle, the Panel will impose a sanction consisting of educational and disciplinary

components.
