pain was confusing, He testified at one point, "1 did not hear her complain about the chest pain to
the assistants." And the father admitted his memory involving his daughter's symptoms in reaction
to the allergy shot was questionable. There is no dispute that Patient A complained of a runny
nose, yet the father stated, at one point, that he did not recall her complaint about the runny nose,
explaining, "It's quite a bit of time ago."

In any event, the Panel does not place much weight on the dispute over the patient's possible
chest pain. Certainly, the decision could factor into our credibility determinations regarding the
Respondent and the patient, but, the Panel, here, does not find it to be of much value in this respect.
And the substance of the dispute over the chest pain adds little to the ultimate issuc. If a patient
does not complain of chest pain but does complain of a runny nose and/or nasal congestion in
response to an allergy shot, the Panel would not fault a physician for urgently and immediately
performing a proper medical examination. It is certainly not because the Respondent responded
with urgency to the patient's reaction that the Panel is sanctioning him. Itis his misconduct during
his response that requires sanctioning. Put another way, it is how he responded, not when he
responded, that disturbs the Panel.

Did Patient A's Father Enter the Examination Room?

Likewise, whether the father entered the examination room on October 29, 2015, is of
minimal importance. There is no dispute that the father was not present to observe the
Respondent's physical interaction with Patient A, on October 29, 2015. And the Panel is not
sanctioning the Respondent for not having a parent chaperone this encounter. It is the
Respondent's behavior during the period when the father was not present that is at issue. With that
said, the Panel finds that the father neither entered the examination room on October 29, 2015, nor

talked with the Respondent that day.
