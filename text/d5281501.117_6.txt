possession and distribution of oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled dangerous substance, was a
crime of moral turpitude.

Dr. Alexander’s conspiracy to distribute and dispense oxycodone and alprazolam was
“Gntentional” and “not innocent in its purpose.” Board of Dental Exam’rs v. Lazzell, 172 Md.
314, 322 (1937). Dr. Alexander knowingly issued prescriptions for oxycodone and alprazolam
to patients without a legitimate medical need and outside the bounds of acceptable medical
practice. In several instances, Dr. Alexander issued prescriptions for oxycodone to patients at
the same time that they were discharged from the practice for abusing illicit drugs.

Dr. Alexander’s criminal conduct in this case undermines the public’s confidence in the
medical profession. See Stidwell v. Maryland State Bd. of Chiropractic Exam’rs, 144 Md. App.
613, 619 (2002) (a criminal offense that undermines the public’s confidence in a profession may
be a crime of moral turpitude if so determined by the appropriate licensing board). Dr.
Alexander’s felony conviction for conspiracy to distribute and dispense oxycodone and
alprazolam is as much a crime of moral turpitude as the substantive crime of distribution and
dispensing the drug. See, e.g., Attorney Grievance Comm’n of Maryland y, Molovinsky, 300 Md.
291, 296 (1984) (the fact “that the conviction was for conspiracy rather than the substantive
offense is of little significance”). In the Board’s view, Dr. Alexander acted “contrary to the
accepted and customary rule of right and duty” that he owes to his fellow citizens in the State of
Maryland. Walman, 280 Mad. at 459.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Based on the above findings of fact and discussion, Panel B concludes that Dr. Alexander

pled guilty to a crime involving moral turpitude. As a result, Health Occ. § 14-404 (b)(1),

requires Panel B to order the suspension of Dr. Alexander’s medical license.
