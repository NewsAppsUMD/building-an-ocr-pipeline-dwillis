Panel does, however, depart from the ALJ's finding that the touching at issue was both over and
under the patient's shorts. The Panel finds that the touching at issue was over the patient's shorts.
Remaining Exceptions concerning Patient B

The Respondent takes exception to the ALJ's proposed finding of fact 16, which states,
"Patient B suffered from allergies and experienced hives on her lower legs and arms." The -
Respondent states that the patient experienced hives “not just on her lower legs and arms, but
scattered throughout her body." The Panel finds that Patient B experienced hives on her arms and
legs. Panel B also finds that her hives were scattered and generalized.

The Respondent takes exception to the ALJ's "criticism that he did not wear a glove." The
ALJ's proposed finding of fact 17 states, "[h]e did not wear a glove.” If this is the language the
Respondent is referring to, the ALJ did not criticize the Respondent for not wearing a glove. The
ALJ simply stated as a fact that "{hJe did not wear a glove."

The Respondent takes exception to the following finding by the ALJ: "[rJeferring to his
electronic medical note from July 17, 2015, the Respondent explained that Patient B came to him
that day with hives on her thighs, despite taking Allegra.” (ALJ's proposed decision at 24.) The
medical record states, "Had hives again on thighs, despite allegra.". The Respondent argues that
the patient "did not have hives during the examination." The Panel agrees with the Respondent
that Patient B did not have active hives during the time she was in the Respondent's office.

In sum, the Respondent's actions, as described in Panel A's findings of fact with respect to
his interactions at issue with Patient B, constitute immoral and unprofessional conduct in the
practice of medicine, in violation of Health Oce. § 14-404(a)(3)(i) and (ii), and sexual misconduct,

see COMAR 10.32.17.02B(2)(a) (sexual impropriety); COMAR 10.32.17.03.
