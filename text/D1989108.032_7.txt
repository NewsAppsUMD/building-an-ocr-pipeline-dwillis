Dr. B’s report and explained that he already had taken many of her concerns into consideration,
but that he did not document them in his report. He acknowledged that he could have done a
better job in documenting and explained that he did account for factors, such as English being a
second language to Dr. Dabela.

The Panel also considered the expert report of Dr. A, a neurologist, who saw Dr. Dabela
on two occasions in February of 2020. Dr. A did not testify at the hearing before the ALJ. Dr. A

A also performed a neurological competency evaluation and opined that Dr. Dabela could return
to work as a physician without limitations.

evaluation using the Zoom platform and was flawed in its substance. The Panel agrees that in-

determine if further evaluations were necessary. Based on the results of the mini mental
evaluation, Dr. R determined that further testing was necessary, which is why he referred Dr.
Dabela to Dr. S for a complete neuropsychological examination.

Dr. Dabela argues that Dr. S’s evaluation was imperfect, contentious, and potentially

lower score, but Dr. S explained that it was a relatively small contributor and that Dr. Dabela was
deemed sufficiently engaged in the process for the evaluation to be considered valid. While the

conditions may not have been optimal due to Dr. Dabela’s resistance and lack of cooperation, Dr.
