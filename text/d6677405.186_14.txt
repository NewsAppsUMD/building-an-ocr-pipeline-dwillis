During his examination, the Respondent squeezed Patient 5’s upper legs with
both hands, asking her if she felt any pain. He continued to squeeze and press
Patient 5’s legs, moving up toward her buttocks. The Respondent then
squeezed her lower buttocks and moved his hands between her legs.

The Respondent moved his fingers so that he was almost touching Patient 5’s
vagina and anus. He then starting pressing very hard in to the bone structure of
the area between Patient 5’s inner thigh and vaginal area and continued to do so
for several minutes.

Patient 5 became very ill at ease with the Respondent's examination. She stated
that because she trusted the Respondent, she rationalized that he was
examining her differently than his previous examinations of her because his
previous treatments had not worked.

On April 15, 2016, Patient 5 filed a complaint with the Board.®

The Respondent was provided a copy of Patient 5's complaint. By letter dated
April 23, 2016, the Respondent stated that he did not recall the patient without
reviewing his notes. The Respondent stated that the examination as described
by Patient 5 “is not in accord with my examinations of the lumbar spine for
patients with chronic lumbar back pain....My standard examination, which is
entirely within the standard of care, includes palpation of the lumbar spine with
minimal to moderate palpation of the facet joint in the lumbar spine but does not

include the legs, the buttock, pelvis, or the vaginal area.”

® There is a discrepancy in the date cited by Patient 5 in her complaint as the date of the Respondent
inappropriately touched her and her later recollection.
