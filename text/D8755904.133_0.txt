Re: Tarik Y. Farrag, M.D.
Case No.: 2223-0062A
License No.: D87559

Dear Dr. Farrag and Mr. Kao:

On March 28, 2023, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2) (2021 Repl.
Vol.). On April 12, 2023, Dr. Farrag was given an opportunity to attend: a post-deprivation
hearing before Disciplinary Panel A to show cause why that suspension should not be continued.
Dr. Farrag attended the hearing. The State was represented by K. F. Michael Kao, Assistant
Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor. Both parties presented oral arguments at the
post-deprivation hearing,

After consideration of the parties’ presentations, Disciplinary Panel A determined, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the health, safety, and welfare of the public imperatively
required the disciplinary panel to summarily suspend Dr. Farrag’s license and there exists a
substantial likelihood of risk of serious harm to the public health, safety, and welfare in Dr.
Farrag’s continued practice. Disciplinary Panel A thus will not lift the summary suspension
