Respondent’s personal relationships with paticnts was a pattern that foresecably could cause
harm to his patients duc to their vulnerability and the trust they placed in the Respondent,
Furthermore, the Board would have had knowledge that the Respondent provided care to his
family members outside the area of his expertise, which could have been deemed reckless or
negligent.

The Respondent has shown little insight into the severity of his actions. He stated that he
provided “successful” care to his family members and saw nothing “wrong with if,” even after
taking the boundary course. He justified the sexual relationship with Patient B stating he “drew
a line in the sand” between the patient and personal relationship, at the same time testifying he
was unaware of the regulation prohibiting such a relationship.

‘The Respondent argued that revocation was too harsh a sanction for things that occurred
so many years ago and | recommended particular oversight that would allow the
Respondent to be fit for cantinued practice including: ongoing MPRP oversight and support;
psychotherapeutic therapy regarding boundaries and personal psychotherapy; chaperones with all
female patients in his office; disclosure of his boundary difficulties to his office staff; and annual
polygraph examinations, among others. Respondent also argued that there is. no absolute
prohibition to treating family members and no evidence that the Respondent provided care below
the standard of care.

The Board countered that the Respondent demonstrated a “plethora of boundary
violations” and used information derived from his professional relationship to develop sexual
relationships with two patients. The Respondent should have foreseen the potential harm to both
these patients as well as to his family members. The Respondent’s role in these relationships

“was to provide care to his patients, not to provide pleasure for himself.
