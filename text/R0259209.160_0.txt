Re: Surrender of License to Practice Radiography
Elizabeth L. Myers, Radiographer

License Number: R02592

Case Number: 7721-0007

Dear Dr. Freas and Members of the Disciplinary Panel B

Please be advised that, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. (“Health Occ.”)
§14-5B-13 (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2019 Supp.), I have decided to SURRENDER my license
to practice radiography in the State of Maryland, License Number R02592, effective
immediately. I understand that upon surrender of my license, I may not practice
radiography, with or without compensation, in the State of Maryland as it is defined in the
Maryland Radiation Therapy, Radiography, Nuclear Medicine Technology, and Radiology
Assistance Act (the “‘Act”), Health Occ. §§ 14-5B-01 ef seg. and other applicable laws. In
other words, as of the effective date of this Letter of Surrender, I understand that the
surrender of my license means that I am in the same position as an unlicensed individual
in the State of Maryland.

I understand that this Letter of Surrender is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT, and upon
Disciplinary Panel B’s (“Panel B”) acceptance, becomes a FINAL ORDER of Panel B of
the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”).

1 acknowledge that the Board initiated an investigation of my practice, summarily
suspended my license to practice radiography on July 9, 2019, and on July 26, 2019, Panel
B issued disciplinary charges against me under Health Occ. § 14-5B-14(a)(3)(is guilty of
unprofessional or immoral conduct in the practice of radiography), (4)(is professionally,
physically, or mentally incompetent), and (8)(i)(provided professional services while under
the influence of alcohol). I resolved these disciplinary charges through a Consent Order
with Panel B, dated October 4, 2019, in which Panel B found that I violated Health Oce. §
14-5B-14(a)(3), (4), and (8)(i). The Consent Order terminated the July 9, 2019 summary
suspension of my license and suspended my license for a minimum of six (6) months with
certain terms and conditions, including that I enroll in the Maryland Professional
Rehabilitation Program (MPRP). A copy of the Consent Order is attached and incorporated
herein as Attachment 1.
