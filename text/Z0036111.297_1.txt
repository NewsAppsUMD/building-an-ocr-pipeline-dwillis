Disciplinary Panel B finds:
BACKGROUND
1. At all times relevant, the Respondent was a polysomnographic technologist

licensed to practice in the State of Maryland. The Respondent was initially licensed in
Maryland on or about October 3, 2013. The Respondent's license expired on or about
May 30, 2017."

2. The Respondent became certified as a Registered Polysomnographic
Technologist (RPSGT) on August 31, 2013. Her certification remains current through

August 31, 2018.

1 A polysomnographic technologist’s license is considered not to lapse on the expiration date if a
complaint and investigatory proceedings had commenced prior to the expiration date. See Health Occ. §
14-5C-16. Therefore, the Board maintains jurisdiction over the Respondent's license for the purpose of
these proceedings.
