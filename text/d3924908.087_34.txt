The Respondent’s failure to obtain valid SPT results due to negative histamine responses
resulted in numerous repeated tests that otherwise would have been unnecessary and fits within
his pattern of unjustified testing and billing. As Dr. Jani testified, “There is also a pattern of
reporting negative histamine response to the initial excessive number of tests to justify repeat
testing.” (Tr. 64.) The Respondents actions and omissions which resulting in poor or negative
histamine responses on SPTs constitutes unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in
violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii); and gross overutilization of health care services,
Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(19).

III. UPCODING

On almost every patient visit, the Respondent billed under the highest billing level (CPT
code 99245), which Dr. Drelich explained is meant for an “initial consultation, and in none of the
records is there the level of complexity documented in the record to bill for that level of
complexity.” (Tr. 244.) The ALJ specifically found that the Respondent unjustifiably billed
under CPT code 99245 for Patients 1, 2,5, 7, and 9. The Panel accepts the ALJ’s determination
that the Respondent upcoded (billed under Code 99245 when the level of services required for
that Code were not provided) for those patients. The Panel does not consider the initial visits for
these patients to have been upcoded. The subsequent visits for Patients 1, 2, 5, 7, and 9 that were
billed under CPT code 99245 were improperly upcoded and constitute unprofessional conduct in
the practice of medicine, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii).

IV. STANDARD OF CARE
While the focus of this decision is the Respondent’s unprofessional conduct and his gross

overutilization, his conduct also constitutes a violation of the standard of care, as described here.
