Gbadamosi’s resignation, the ALJ therefore correctly determined that he falsely answered
Question Io of his 2017 Renewal Application to the Board. Mr. Gbadamosi’s exception to
Finding of Fact 25 is denied.

Mr. Gbadamosi also excepts generally to the ALJ's proposed conclusions of law. In
essence, he rehashes his testimonial claims that the ALJ rejected at the evidentiary hearing,
because she found his testimony lacking in credibility. The ALJ’s conclusions were correctly
based on the findings established by the evidence presented by the State at the evidentiary
hearing. Mr, Gbadamosi intended his “NO” answers to fully represent his responses to the Board
and the hospital at which he sought employment. His answers conveyed the impression of an
unblemished history, an impression very much at odds with his criminal and employment
background. His answers were not only false, but willfully made in order to deceive the Board
and employers regarding his criminal history and prior termination of employment. See Proposed
Decision, pp. 18, 20, There is also no doubt about the effect of Mr. Gbadamosi’s false
representations. Because of his deception, the Board and his employers logically but incorrectly
assumed that there was no problematic background information that would raise concerns about
his qualifications. Neither the Board nor the hospital had any knowledge of his criminal history.
Nor did the hospital know about Mr. Gbadamosi’s termination from prior employment or the
reason for the termination. Relying on his false application responses, the Board reinstated his
license in 2014 and renewed his license in 2017. The hospital granted his application for
privileges in 2015. The panel rejects Mr. Gbadamosi’s self-exonerating narrative and denies

these exceptions.
