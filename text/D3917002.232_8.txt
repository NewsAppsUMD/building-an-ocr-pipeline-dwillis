At the hearing, Dr Mathur acknowledged his prior disciplinary history, his written
communication to the Board regarding a medical condition, and his agreement to comply with
the March 4, 2020 Consent Order’s conditions. He argued that his disciplinary history was not
relevant to the Show Cause proceeding. He maintained that he did not realize the import of the
conditions or time frames involved in the Consent Order and that he did not obtain a supervisor
because no one would donate their time and he did not practice anesthesiology. Dr. Mathur
asserted that he told his primary care physician to send his health information to the Program and
that the Board already had details of his medical history. He argued that the Program did not do a
proper job evaluating him but admitted that there were certain areas in which he was deficient
and needed to get up to speed, and further admitted that the evaluation results showed he
required a structured, individualized, educational intervention. He expressed unhappiness with
his poor performance on the written ECG interpretation exercise but blamed the computer and
the format used.

While acknowledging his deficiencies and educational needs, Dr. Mathur contended that
the Panel should not give the Report findings any weight or credibility. He claimed that the
Report mistakenly referred to him as “Dr. Smith” in an Appendix at the end of the Report and
that this section contained his specific results and recommendations. In response to questions
from panel members, Dr. Mathur stated an intent to practice critical care medicine, hospital
medicine, or internal medicine, and to complete an unpaid fellowship or one-year residency
program that would make him a qualified physician. He did not provide any details or
verification that he was accepted into such a program. Dr. Mathur also confirmed that he was

employed and had resumed medical practice and was seeing four to five patients a month.
