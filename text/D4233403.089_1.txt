2. His responses, behavior, and conduct, four days later, on January 11, 2019,
when Board staff conducted a site visit at his medical office;

3. His initial consultation at the Maryland Professional Rehabilitation
Program (“MPRP”) on February 4, 2019, which revealed evidence of

professional, physical or mental incompetence; and

4. His failure to submit to an appropriate examination as directed by the
Board, pursuant Health Occ. § 14-402.

The Board opened this case based on a complaint about Respondent’s prescribing
of opioids for a patient who subsequently overdosed and required several days of
hospitalization. The initial focus of the investigation was on possible inappropriate
prescribing of opioids and other controlled dangerous substances (“CDS”). However,
after Board staff interviewed Respondent in January 2019, the focus of the investigation
became Respondent’s competence and potential danger to the public.

Based on the investigatory information obtained by Panel A as summarized
above, and the specific instances described below, Panel A has reason to believe that the
following facts are true and that there is a substantial likelihood of a risk of serious harm
to the public health, safety, or welfare by Respondent.
