the Respondent’s license to practice medicine in Maryland be suspended until he is in treatment

issues, that he be allowed to immediately petition the Board for the reinstatement of his suspended
license.

The State filed exceptions to the ALJ’s proposed decision, arguing that Board Disciplinary
Panel A (“Panel A” or the “Panel’’) should conclude that the Respondent violated all of the charged
grounds, thus Panel A should reject the ALJ’s conclusions concerning professional, physical, or
mental incompetence and habitual intoxication and that the ALJ erred by reversing the summary
suspension. The Respondent did not file exceptions but did file an opposition to the State’s
