nurse brought her an incomplete anesthesia sheet from a case the Respondent had done at
around 7:30 a.m., after which the Manager spoke to the Medical Director because of
concerns about the Respondent. The Manager stated that the Medical Director stated that
the Respondent was “not himself... [hJe seems to be fumbling around looking for things
in the anesthesia cart. It was something that was plain in sight.” The Manager stated that
she and the Medical Director then confronted the Respondent and asked him if he was ill
and wanted to go home. In response, the Respondent stated that he was fine but later
admitted that “he did have a few drinks last night” and was concerned that he would lose
his job. The Manager stated that she then relieved the Respondent of his duties and
escorted him to a laboratory for blood alcohol testing. The Manager stated that she
instructed the Respondent to call her after testing so that she could pick him up and take
him home, but the Respondent never called her and she was later told that the Respondent’s
vehicle was no longer on the Facility’s lot.
