turned so the Respondent was behind her, so she could point to where the pain was. He asked
her to raise her shirt, which she did, about midway up her back. The Respondent placed his
hands on her waist and started to feel her lower back with his thumbs while asking her where the
pain was. The Respondent then asked her to lower her pants. She lowered her pants about
halfway down her buttocks. The Respondent then commented on how good Complainant 2
looked from behind and that her underwear was “very cute.” The Respondent was giggling.
Complainant 2 felt she was being taken advantage of, so she lifted her pants back up and left the
room.

11. | When Complainant 2 came back from maternity leave in October 2016, she
worked with the Respondent two days per week, Mondays and Wednesdays. She maintained this
schedule until May 2017. The Respondent asked her about her sex life with her fiancé and told
her that she would have a better time with him than with her fiancé. The Respondent also
physically touched her on days that they worked together. The touching was unwanted by
Complainant 2. He stroked her neck and massaged it. He also grabbed Complainant’s 2’s hair
and then would use it to turn her head. He showed her pictures of other women wearing risqué
Halloween costumes and said that he would love to see her in these costumes. The Respondent
physically grabbed Complainant 2 and pulled her close to him. He made comments about her
bra. At the scrub sink, the Respondent embraced her from behind. He felt her legs to see
whether she had shaved her legs. Complainant 2 testified, “I would describe it as it was a daily
occurrence. Every day he physically touched me. He verbally harassed me every day, every
shift I was there with him.” (T. 239.)

12, On April 19, 2017, Complainant 2 observed the Respondent slap the buttocks of

an anesthetized patient (“Patient 1”).
