of the SPT from July 11, 2011, for Patient 4 (State’s Exhibit 23 at 399) for the same allergens,
and the Respondent provided the Board this form in July 2015. And these documents contain
different writings on them. Then, the Respondent admitted that one document (Resp. Ex. 7 at
304 ) was written “‘several years after the actual visit.” (Tr. 506.) Another example is Patient 6’s
results for the PT of March 24, 2014. There is one version from the documents he submitted to
the Board in July 2015 (State’s Ex. 27 at 511-13) and a different version in Respondent’s Exhibit
6 at 209-10. And third, the records contradict themselves. For example, the supplemental
records contain a signed statement from the Respondent stating that he did not see Patient 6 in
April 2014. (Resp. Ex. 17 at 464.) Notwithstanding his representation that he did not provide
services to Patient 6 in April 2014, the Respondent later admitted into evidence several purported
medical records of his treatment of Patient 6 for treatment purportedly provided on April 15,
2014 (e.g., Resp. Ex. 6 at 192-95, 219). What is clear is that these later produced records are not
what they purport to be. It should be clear from the documents when the documents were
actually written. These records do not. These records were written years after the services were
provided or purportedly provided but that is not mentioned in the records. The information
contained in the supplemental documents is not trustworthy and, in some cases, outright false. In
any case, the supplemental records the Respondent belatedly produced are not reliable indicators
of his purported treatment.’ The exception is denied.

The Panel has carefully considered the Respondent’s other exceptions, which take issue
with numerous details in the ALJ’s decision. There are several instances in which the

Respondent’s exceptions are correct; that is, the ALJ did at times misstate certain dates, number

> The Panel deems the supplemental records to be the documents the Respondent provided the
Board in March 2016 after the peer review reports were issued and the records concerning
Patients 6 and 4 in Respondent’s Exhibits 6 and 7.
