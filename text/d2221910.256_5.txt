performed the procedure in his private office instead of referring the patient to a higher level of
care facility.

Dr. Alexander delivered Patient A’s stillborn fetus at 28 weeks gestation in his private
office without the assistance of any licensed medical staff and without the surgical equipment
needed to perform surgery if any complications arose. The office was not a licensed surgical

when the appropriate obstetric protocols required the induction of labor and delivery to occur at a
higher level facility. The Panel agrees.

“[t]here were four articles that specifically discussed abortions in an outpatient setting” and that
based on the age of the fetus, “only one is directly applicable, addressing fetal anomalies and
