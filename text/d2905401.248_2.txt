patients, were filled with piles of paper, trash, food, medication samples, and
patient charts, to the point where Board staff was unable to open one of the office
doors.

Board staff also obtained pharmacy records, which documented that the
Respondent was prescribing controlled dangerous substances to patients.

On or about December 21, 2017, Board staff made a second unannounced visit to
the Respondent's office in Westminster. The purpose of the visit was to deliver
subpoenas for individual patient records, and a subpoena to appear for an
interview at the Board’s office on December 28, 2017 at 1:00 p.m.

The office was dark and no one answered the door initially on this date. Board staff
inquired at a medical office nearby, “Suite E”, and the receptionist there informed
Board staff that the Respondent's patients often come into Suite E looking for the
Respondent.

Shortly thereafter, the Respondent arrived and let Board staff into the office. The
office remained in a state of total disarray, with piles of clutter, food, and papers
dominating much of the space. Used dog toys and dog hair were observed
covering the couch in the office where the Respondent sees patients.

On December 28, 2017, the Respondent failed to appear for the interview to which
she had been subpoenaed. The Respondent failed to offer any explanation for her

absence.
