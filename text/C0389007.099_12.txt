In March or April 2015, Physician B joined Practice A (where the Respondent was then
working). The Respondent did not complete and sign a delegation agreement for Physician
B to serve as her supervising physician.

The Respondent never completed another delegation agreement for anyone to serve as her

supervising physician at Hospital A.

. Hospital A notified the Respondent that it was terminating her employment effective

February 20, 2017 for:
unsatisfactory job performance or otherwise not performing to standards,
engaging in activity detrimental to the operations of the hospital, deliberate
inattention to patient care, or engaging in any conduct detrimental to patient care,
misrepresenting assessment and diagnosis findings in medical record,
State Ex. 1 memorandum at 1, termination report at 2.
Physician D was involved in the decision to terminate the Respondent’s employment.
Hospital A sent a required “Termination of Employment (Delegation Agreement) Report” to
the Board, which it received on February 23, 2017.° Lay Person A completed the report, in
which he noted Physician D was the Respondent’s supervisor, based solely on the fact
Physician D was the medical director.
Physician D did not have any reason to know, in his capacity as medical director, whether the
Respondent had a delegation agreement for anyone in particular to serve as her supervising
physician.
Lay Person A completed the report without Physician D’s knowledge.
The Board initiated an investigation of the termination. It requested records from Hospital A,

which, among others, submitted the December 2014 delegation agreement for Physician C to

serve as the supervising physician.

* A termination report is required when the termination is related to a quality of care issue. Health Occ, § 15-103,
