In discounting the ALJ’s legal conclusions that he engaged in prospective, non-IRB
approved human subject research, Dr. MacKoul essentially urges the Panel to accept excerpts from
OHRP guidance and decision charts as controlling substitutes for the substantive federal
regulations and Maryland law that he provided to the ALJ.!5 Contrary to Dr. MacKoul’s
arguments, OHRP guidance does not supersede the governing federal regulations or Maryland law.
Rather, the OHRP emphasizes that the charts should not be used as substitutes for consulting the
regulations and cautions that the full text of applicable regulatory provisions should be considered

issue of human subject research. (Prop. Dec. at 9; Tr. 264-346) Dr. MacKoul offered Dr. Prentice
as an expert on the federal statutes and regulations for human experimentation, IRB rules, surgical

testimony, Dr. Prentice relied on the applicable federal regulations and the regulatory definition of
research in 45 C.E.R. § 46. (Tr. 371-374, 384) In his expert report, Dr. Prentice confirmed that his

opinion was largely confined to the issue of whether Dr. MacKoul violated the requirements of the
