brushed across Patient 6’s vaginal area and clitoris. Patient 6 jumped back from
the Respondent.

Patient 6 became so uncomfortable when the Respondent examined her that, “I
stopped it.” Patient 6 told the Respondent that she did not want him to physically
examine her because she was in too much pain and that he would make the pain
worse if he touched her. Patient 6 told Board staff, “...then eventually he didn’t
kind of force me anymore to because he saw | was very persistent about him not
examining me because | used to tell him it hurt too bad.”

The Respondent continued to administer injections to Patient 6 even after, at her
request, he had stopped physically examining her.

During her under-oath interview, Patient 6 stated, “why would [the Respondent]
do that when people trusted him? It’s not fair that as a doctor he’s putting us
through this.” Patient 6 further stated, “[a]ls much as it hurts me, it really hurts me
that | feel like I’m betraying him but he shouldn’t do nobody like this.”

The Respondent was provided a copy of Patient 6’s complaint. By letter dated
April 23, 2016, the Respondent denied touching Patient 6’s buttocks or “private
parts” and stated that “my standard examination includes palpation of the lumbar
spine, but does not and has not included touching a patient's ‘private area’ or the
buttock.”
