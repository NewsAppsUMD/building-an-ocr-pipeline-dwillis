including Complainant 1. When the Medtronic balls fell, some of the people in the OR commented
with innuendo about the Medtronic balls rolling on the floor.

7. Ina playful, silly manner, Complainant | picked up one ball from the floor and put
it in the Respondent’s shirt pocket, saying, “Here you go.” The Respondent was no longer gowned
at the time, so the pocket of his shirt was accessible.

8. The Respondent looked at Complainant 1 and said, “Why don’t you put them in
your mouth?” Complainant 1 responded, “Ooh that’s gross.”

9. Later the same day, while Complainant 1 was documenting the surgery on her
computer, the Respondent came around behind her and put his right hand approximately six inches
down Complainant 1’s V-neck scrub shirt onto her chest at the bottom of the V-neck and the top
of Complainant |’s cleavage area.

10. Onother occasions, the Respondent commented a few times about Complainant 1’s
underwear and bra. He touched her upper shoulder blade and back.

11. On one occasion, before the incident with the Medtronic balls, Complainant 1 had
an outburst with the Respondent when he chastised her for leaving the OR during a procedure and
she told him she had to change her tampon.

12. On August 30, 2020, Complainant | filed her Complaint (Complaint No. 1) with
the Board. The complaint was dated August 25, 2020. Complainant 1 alleged in the Complaint
that the Respondent asked her to put ball-shaped pieces of a surgical instrument in her mouth, after
which he touched her skin at the V-neck of her scrub shirt, and that he would touch her back and

shoulders and comment on the color of her undergarments.
