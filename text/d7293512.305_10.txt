investigation was not an issue before the ALJ and is not an issue before the Panel. The Panel,
like the ALJ, makes its determination of factual findings and conclusions of law regarding Dr.
Basco’s alleged unprofessional conduct and sexual misconduct based on the testimony of
witnesses and admission of exhibits at the OAH hearing.
Vv. State’s Exceptions

The State argues that the Panel should reject the ALJ’s conclusion that there was
insufficient evidence to find that Dr. Basco sexually violated Patient A. The Panel declines to do
so. The Panel adopts the ALJ’s finding that there is insufficient evidence to prove sexual
misconduct because Patient A was under the anesthetic Ketamine when the sexual abuse was
alleged. The State also argues that Dr. Basco’s outburst related to Employee B was
unprofessional conduct. The Board adopts the ALJ’s finding that this outburst was not
unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The Panel concludes that Dr. Basco is guilty of unprofessional conduct in the practice of
medicine in violation of § 14-404(a)(3)(ii) of the Health Occupations Article based on his
inappropriate sexual touching of Patient B and his putting ice down Employee A’s pants. The
Panel also concludes that Dr. Basco’s conduct related to Patient B was sexual misconduct in
violation of COMAR 10.32.17.03. The Panel concludes that Dr. Basco’s conduct related to
Patient A, Employee B, and Employee C does not constitute unprofessional conduct in the
practice of medicine.

SANCTION

The Panel has considered Dr. Basco’s current sexual violation committed against Patient
B and the unprofessional conduct related to the ice incident with Employee A. The Panel also

has considered Dr. Basco’s prior Maryland disciplinary history including (1) a reciprocal action
