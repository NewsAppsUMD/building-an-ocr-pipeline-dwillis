Opinion 8.19 — Self-treatment or Treatment of Immediate Family Members (June
1993)

Physicians generally should not treat themselves or members of their immediate
families. Professional objectivity may be compromised when an immediate
family member or the physician is the patient; the physician’s personal feelings
may unduly influence his or her professional medical judgment, thereby
interfering with the care being delivered. Physicians may fail to probe sensitive
areas when taking the medical history or may fail to perform intimate parts of the
physical examination...VWhen treating themselves or immediate family members,

physicians may be inclined to treat problems that are beyond their expertise or
training.

...Except in emergencies, it is not appropriate for physicians to write
prescriptions for controlled substances for themselves or immediate family
members. (I, Il, lV)
