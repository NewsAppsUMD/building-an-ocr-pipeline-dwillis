questioned by the State about the 2015 pect review, his testimony took a seismic shift toward
ignorance and befuddlement. |: do not find it credible the Respondent would not be aware of the
2015 peer review, especially since it concerned a procedure integral to his practice at the ASC.
Thus, I find CareFirst performed some form of péer review in 2015. At the hearing, Counsel for
the Respondent objected to the State cross examining Ms, Welter and the Respondent about the
2015 peer review. I overruled the objection. The Respondent and Ms. Welter testified that the
Respondent’s contract with CareFirst allowed him to bill 37617 in conjunction with
hysterectomies. I found the simple question of whether or not they knew CareFirst performed a
peer review in 2015 appropriate in light of that testimony.

The more important questions are what was the exact nature of the 2015 peer review and
if CareFirst denied billing for code 37617 as a result of that peer review, why? The State chose
not to answer those questions in its case in chief. It did not call any representatives from
CareFirst. It neither listed the 2015 peer review documents in its prehearing statement nor listed
them as an exhibit. Instead the State attempted to introduce the 2015 peer review documents on
cross examination of the Respondent as rebuttal. The Respondent objected, and I sustained the
objection.

| find the State could have, and should have, introduced the 2015 peer review documents
in its case in chief, The issue of whether the Respondent properly billed code 37617 in light of
his contract with CareFirst goes to the heart of this particular charge. Whether any contractual ,
dispute the Respondent may have had with CareFirst over billing code 37617 rises to a level of
what the Board alleges in its charging document is unknown. Given CareFirst is the party who
filed the complaint with the Board, there is no doubt the State could have called a representative
from CareFirst in its case in chief. That witness could have testified not only about the 2015 peer
review documents, but also the general propriety of the Respondent billing of code 37617.
