The Administrative Procedure Act permits a specialized administrative body such as the Board
to “use its experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge in the evaluation of
evidence.” Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-213(i).

Panel A agrees with the State that Dr. Singhal’s conduct was “‘cufficiently intertwined
with patient care’ to pose a threat to patients or the medical profession.” Cornfeld, 174 Md. App.
at 474 (quoting Banks, 354 Md. at 76-77). The Cornfeld Court explained that this “may be

harmed patients, created a substantial risk of harm to them, or diminished the standing of the
medical profession as caregivers.” Jd. at 478. Here, Dr. Singhal’s insidious conduct began

profession.

First, the exploitative behavior began while Dr. Singhal was still Patient 1’s doctor. Dr.
Singhal’s knowledge about Patient 1’s sexual problems was information he obtained during
treatment sessions. Dr. Singhal’s advice caused Patient 1 to become more distanced from his
wife occurred during treatment sessions. But even the conduct that occurred after Patient 1
stopped seeing Dr. Singhal was in the practice of medicine. The Panel does not find that the duty
to refrain from exploiting a patient immediately ends after the patient stops being a patient.

treatment.

The American Medical Association guidelines state that a sexual relationship with a
former patient is unethical when the physician “uses or exploits trust, knowledge, emotions, or

influence derived from the previous [medical] relationship, or if a romantic relationship would
