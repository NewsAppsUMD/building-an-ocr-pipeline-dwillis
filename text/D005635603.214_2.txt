Harbhajan Ajrawat, M.D., Chair and Members of Disciplinary Panel B
RE: Hugo Benalcazar
Letter of Surrender

I further recognize and agree that by submitting this Letter of Surrender, my license in
Maryland will remain surrendered unless and until the Board grants reinstatement. In the event
that I apply for reinstatement of my Maryland License, I understand that Panel B or its successor

is not required to grant reinstatement, and, if it does grant reinstatement, Panel B or its successor
may impose any terms and conditions Panel B or its successor considers appropriate for public
safety and the protection of the integrity and reputation of the profession. I further understand that,
if I file a petition for reinstatement, I will approach Panel B or its successor in the same position
as an individual whose license has been revoked.

I acknowledge that I may not rescind this Letter of Surrender in part or in its entirety for
any reason whatsoever. Finally, I wish to make clear that I have been advised of my right to be
represented by an attorney of my choice throughout proceedings before Panel B, including the
right to consult with an attorney prior to signing this Letter of Surrender. I understand both the
nature of Panel B's actions and this Letter of Surrender fully. I acknowledge that I understand and
comprehend the language, meaning and terms and effect of this Letter of Surrender. I make this

decision knowingly and voluntarily.
Very truly yours,

Signature On File

(dugo Benalcazar, M.D.
