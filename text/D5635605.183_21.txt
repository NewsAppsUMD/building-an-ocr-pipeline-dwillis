 

physicians disruptively, that is, speak or act in ways that may

negatively affect patient care, including conduct that interferes with

the individual’s ability to work with other members of the health

care team, or for others to work with the physician.

Disruptive behavior is different from criticism offered in good faith

with the aim of improving patient care and from collective action on

the part of physicians.
(State’s Ex. 31, S-521-22.) AMA Opinion 9.045 (June 2000) states, in pertinent part, “Personal
conduct, whether verbal or physical, that negatively affects or that potentially may negatively
affect patient care constitutes disruptive behavior.” (State’s Ex. 31, S-520)

The ALJ also found violations of the sexual misconduct regulations. COMAR 10.32.17 et
seq. However, the sexual misconduct regulations that the ALJ addressed and which were cited in
the amended charges, were amended in 2019. Because these amended regulations went into effect
after the incidents at issue occurred, the amended regulations are inapplicable and thus the Panel
has not considered whether the Respondent violated these amended regulations. For this reason,
the Panel does not find that the Respondent violated COMAR 10.32.17 ef seq. (as amended May
20, 2019). However, a violation of the sexual misconduct regulations is not a requirement and is
not necessary for there to be a violation of § 14-404(a)(3) of the Health Occupations Article.

Il. PANEL B’S CREDIBILITY DETERMINATION OF THE RESPONDENT

There are several findings that depended upon credibility determinations. In making its
credibility determination of the Respondent, the Panel found the Respondent’s testimony
concerning three incidents especially significant: (A) the slapping of the anesthetized patient’s
buttocks, (B) the Respondent saying to Complainant 2 that he wanted to spank her, and (C) his

interactions with Individual 4.
