Case No.: 2221-0011A
License No.: D88339

Dear Dr. Freyer and Counsel:

On October 26, 2020, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl.
Vol. and 2019 Supp.). Dr. Freyer was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing
before Disciplinary Panel A on November 4, 2020, to show cause why that suspension should not
be continued. Dr. Freyer attended the hearing on that date together with his counsel, Natasha
Wesker, Esq. The State was represented by Nicholas Johansson, Assistant Attorney General,
Administrative Prosecutor. Both parties presented oral arguments at the post-deprivation hearing.

After consideration of the presentations of the parties, Disciplinary Panel A determined
that it would continue the summary suspension imposed on October 26, 2020. Disciplinary Panel
A thus will not lift the order of summary suspension. Disciplinary Panel A finds that the public
health, safety, and welfare imperatively requires the summary suspension of Dr. Freyer’s license
to practice medicine. See State Gov't § 10-226(c)(2)(i). The order of summary suspension is thus
reaffirmed and continues in effect. See COMAR 10.32.02.08H(1).
