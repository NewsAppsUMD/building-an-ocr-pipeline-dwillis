I. INTRODUCTION

1. At all times relevant hereto, the Respondent was licensed as a respiratory
care practitioner in the State of Maryland. The Respondent was initially licensed as a
respiratory care practitioner in Maryland on December 20, 1994, under License Number
L02034. The Respondent's latest Maryland respiratory care practitioner's license has
an expiration date of May 30, 2018.

2. The Board initiated an investigation of the Respondent after receiving a
complaint in 2016 alleging that the Respondent sexually assaulted a female co-worker
("Health Care Worker A")? at a Maryland health care facility ("Health Care Facility A")
where he was practicing respiratory care therapy. During this investigation, the Board
revisited a prior investigation involving allegations that the Respondent sexually
assaulted a female co-worker ("Health Care Worker B") in 2008 at another Maryland
health care facility ("Health Care Facility B") where he was practicing respiratory care
therapy.

3. The Board's investigation determined that the Respondent sexually
assaulted Health Care Workers A and B at health care facilities in Maryland while
working in his capacity as a respiratory care practitioner at the facilities. In both
incidents, the Respondent pleaded guilty to and/or was convicted of criminal offenses in
connection with these assaults. In addition, the Respondent made material
misrepresentations to the Board in his licensure renewal applications and in response to

Board inquiry regarding his criminal history.

* For confidentiality reasons, the names of health care workers, complainants, other individuals or health
care facilities will not be identified by name in this Order for Summary Suspension. The Respondent may
obtain the identity of any individual or entity referenced herein by contacting the assigned administrative
prosecutor.
