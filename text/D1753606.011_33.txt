regarding their shared patients. However, she was seeing patients independent of the
Respondent and did not have the opportunity to evaluate the Respondent as he performed his

competence to practice medicine at this time. While there have been no credible complaints
raised by colleagues or patients regarding deficient patient care to this date, the Board is not
required to wait until an actual injury occurs. I do not doubt Nurse fia cstimony

the general public at risk based on his mental incompetence. In this regard, as set forth above, I
believe that the evidence is clear that the Respondent’s cognitive impairment affects his ability to
safely practice medicine and emergency action is required to address this imminent threat, As
such, I find that the Board’s decision to summarily suspend the Respondent’s license is correct. 1
also find that the Board has proven that the Respondent violated section 14-404(a) of the
Medical Practice Act based on mental incompetence to practice medicine.
