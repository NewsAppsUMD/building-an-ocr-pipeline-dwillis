Current Violation

Violation of the Participant Rehabilitation Agreement and November 2019 Order

On September 19, 2022, MPRP reported to the Board that Dr. Andrews had engaged in
conduct that violated the 2019 Participant Rehabilitation Agreement. MPRP included written
substantiation of her violation. After initially denying the violation to MPRP, Dr. Andrews later
admitted violating her Rehabilitation Agreement. Following a request from the Board for a
response to MPRPâ€™s report, Dr. Andrews acknowledged in a letter to the Board dated September
26, 2022, that she had violated the November 2019 Order, apologized to the Board, described a
series of personal and employment-related pressures that preceded her violation and steps she had
since taken to address them. On October 24, 2022, Panel A issued a Violation of Board Order and
Notice to Show Cause charging Dr. Andrews with failure to comply with her Rehabilitation
Agreement, in violation of the November 2019 Order.
Show Cause Hearing: December 7, 2022

On December 7, 2022, Panel A held a show cause hearing. Dr. Andrews appeared with
her counsel, admitted and expressed remorse for her violation, and requested that Panel A not
suspend her medical license. She asked that the panel instead impose a reprimand and an increased
period of probation to include continued participation in MPRP. Dr. Andrews stated that she
remained in MPRP since her violation, had successfully completed a program aimed at preventing
the conduct at issue, and had taken additional recovery and therapeutic steps to prevent recurrence.
While acknowledging that there was no excuse for her violation, she discussed the details of her
violation, the effects of family obligations and work-related stressors, and her renewed dedication

to recovery. Dr. Andrews also presented letters of recommendation from a program medical officer

and her employers.
