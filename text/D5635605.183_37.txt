D. Individual 6

The ALJ found that, on three occasions and without Individual 6’s consent, the Respondent
touched Individual 6’s shoulders as if to give her a massage while Individual 6 was sitting at her
desk. On exceptions, the Respondent argues that the evidence does not support the ALJ’s
conclusion that this constitutes sexual misconduct. According to the Respondent, the “testimony
from others was that Respondent was an equal opportunity ‘hugger’ and exhibited collegial forms
of interpersonal touching with both men and women. The type of interaction was described by
[Individual 8] and others.” The Respondent then questions how conduct in one instance is
“unquestionably benign” and in another instance “deemed sexually charged” when there is no
“appreciable difference.”

The Respondent's conduct that Individual 8 testified to was clearly not-always “collegial”
or “benign.” For instance, Individual 8 testified that Complainant 2 was uncomfortable with the
Respondent touching her. Despite clear indications that certain touching was unwanted and not
consented to, the Respondent continued to touch Individual 6. Moreover, the Panel is not
convinced that the Respondent was an “equal opportunity” hugger and toucher of both men and

women, Individual 9, a male physician assistant, testified:

And who would he hug that you saw?
The -- the nurse, the tech, I mean —
Did he ever hug you, [Individual 9]?
No, I don’t think so.
Did you observe him hug other men?
No.
. Did you ever observe the respondent touch other men’s
necks or shoulders?
A. No.
