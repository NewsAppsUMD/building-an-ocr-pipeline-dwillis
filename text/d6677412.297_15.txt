examination and abused the trust of the patient in engaging in inappropriate sexual touching of
her buttocks.

Patient 6 returned to see Dr. Williams for subsequent appointments because he was the
only doctor she knew who would perform spinal injections under sedation. During one
appointment when Patient 6 was at the surgical center to get a spinal injection, Dr. Williams
conducted an examination of her and his thumb brushed across her clitoris. Patient 6 was
wearing a gown and was fully unclothed except for her underwear. On both occasions there was
no chaperone present during the examination and Dr. Williams did not wear gloves. Patient 6 did
not complain to anyone about Dr. Williams’s conduct at the time because she trusted him and
thought that maybe she misinterpreted his conduct. Patient 6 testified that she was uncomfortable
with Dr. Williams’s conduct, yet still believed he was a good doctor and was complimentary of
his care. She did not want to believe that Dr. Williams would touch her inappropriately, but
when she was informed of the news broadcast concerning allegations against Dr. Williams she
reassessed whether her concerns were unfounded and she filed a complaint with the Board
because she did not want anyone else to go through what she went through.

Dr. Williams argues that Patient 6 is not credible because she could not remember
specific dates when the conduct occurred and she changed her testimony regarding whether Dr.
Williams was standing or sitting on a stool during the examination where he brushed her clitoris.
At the OAH hearing Patient 6 admitted that she was unsure about whether Dr. Williams was
standing or sitting when he examined her, but she was unyielding in her testimony that the
touching occurred. She explained, “I know what he did. I know his finger went across my
clitoris. I’m sorry if I did not get everything correct when I went there. I know that’s what he did

to me.”
