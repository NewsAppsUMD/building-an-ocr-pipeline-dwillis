misconduct or inimoral or unprofessional conduct when examining Individual E. I found the
Respondent’s denial to be credible for the reasons explained above and there is no corroborating
evidence of any behavior manifested by the Respondent toward individual E during the
examination in question that would support a finding of sexual, immoral and unprofessional

In February 2015, the Respondent conducted an examination of Individual F, as a
result of a potential GI bleed. The Respondent examined Individual F after an endoscopic
medical procedure. Subsequent to the examination, Individual F requested the Respondent show
her the source of the bleed. When Individual F made the request, she was standing a few feet

consistent with what she told the Board. For his part, the Respondent testified that he only
vaguely remembers Individual F. He testified that he probably touched the breast with his finger
but did not do so to feel it. .

Individual F was alarmed and shocked by the action. The Respondent indicated that there was
