According to Dr. A, another E.R. physician, Dr. B, was notified about the incident
with regard to Patient A, and had advised the Respondent to stop the practice of
requesting patients turn over their pain medications to him.

On or about May 3, 2015, a second nurse, Nurse B, reported to Dr. A that the
Respondent had again requested two patients turn over their pain medications to
him (the Respondent). On May 3, 2015, the Respondent had requested that
Patient B’s son provide him (the Respondent) with Patient A’s Vicodin‘ for
safekeeping. On Patient B’s discharge from Hospital A, the Vicodin was missing.
According to Nurse B, a similar incident had occurred on April 27, 2015, with
another patient, Patient C.

On or about May 4, 2015, Dr. A discussed the Respondent's conduct with him by
telephone, and the Respondent acknowledged that he had obtained the pain
medication from the patients described above, but that his attempt was to
decrease the amount of excess opiates in the community and responsibly
prescribe pain medication. Dr. A instructed the Respondent to stop the practice
immediately as it was not consistent with the usual practice within the department
or in line with medical policy.

On or about May 13, 2015, Dr. A met with the Respondent and requested that in
order to “clear any controversy” the Respondent submit to a urine drug screen.
The Respondent refused to submit to a urine screen and he resigned from
employment. Dr. A subsequently terminated him from employment for reasons

set forth below.
