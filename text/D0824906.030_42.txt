upon the Respondent that upon notice of the charges, he immediately ceased treatment of his
family in any capacity. -
The aggravating circumstances in this case are the facts that the Respondent’s treatment

of some of his family members continued over an extended period of time, and the Respondent’s

. extensive history with the Board. As the State pointed out, the Respondent has had previous

char: ges lodged against him'by the Board that included misrepresentations, unprofessional
conduct in the practice of medicine, and violations of the standard of care, As a result of the _

previous violations, the Respondent was on ptobation from 2007 to 2018 and has been required

to take various courses in ethics and record keeping. In addition, the Respondent has received

fines totaling $65,000.00.

In addition to these aggravating circumstances, Thave considered the Respondent’s

testimony at the hearing that the treatment of his family may have been “inappropriate” or “ill-

advised” but was not unprofessional or in violation of the Code of Ethics. Based on his extended ,

disciplinary history and his failure to acknowledge that his behavior was in contravention of the

code of ethics and unprofessional reflects a lack of insight as to his professional and moral

obligations as provided for in the Code of Ethic, Therefore, J find the State’s proposed sanction
consisting of a three-month suspension and a $25,000.00 fine is appropriate.

PROPOSED CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

 

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact and Discussion, I conclude as a matter of law

that the Respondent did violate the Maryland Medical Practice Act. Md. Code Ann., Health Occ.

§ 14-404(a)(3)Gi) (Supp. 2019). As aresult, I conclude that the Respondent is subject to

disciplinary sanctions for the cited violations. Id; COMAR 10.32.02.09A-B.
