The Respondent testified on his own behalf. He reviewed his personal information and
provided clear responses to the same questions that were posed to him during the interview,

some point. He described the rapport that he had with his patients and their families, and stated
that he misses medicine. He also described some of the treatments that he routinely employed
with patients for ear infections, strep, and bronchitis.

Peace | a nurse practitioner employed by the Respondent's practice,
testified on the Respondent’s behalf. She reported working with the Respondent for three years.
During that time, after an initial training period where she shadowed the Respondent, she saw the
Respondent’s patients independent of him. She stated that he knew the patients so well and

dementia patients. He demonstrated a vast knowledge of the measures that are regularly utilized
