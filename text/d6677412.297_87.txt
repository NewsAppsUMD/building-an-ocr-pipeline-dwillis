began seeing the Respondent for pain management services, because he could now provide those
services in-house. .
Patient 3 testified that from June 2011 through December 2013, the Respondent provided
pain management services to her without incident. That changed on December 16, 2013. On that
_ date, Patient 3 testified, the Respondent saw her in a small examination room FL
ae After making some adjustments with respect to her intrathecal pump, the
. Respondent performed an examination of Patient 3’s spine, because Patient 3 had indicated to
the Respondent that her pain was increasing and that she was feeling some numbness in her feet.
According to Patient 3, the Respondent directed her to get off the table where she was
sitting and stand up. She was dressed in street clothes, and the Respondent directed her to lower
. her pants below her buttocks. After she did so, he began pressing up and down her spine, toward
the bones that protrude from each side of the spinal column, At this point, Patient 3’s underwear
was below her buttocks’ cheeks.

After examining Patient 3’s pelvic region, the Respondent began examining Patient 3
between her legs. He started pushing up between her legs on both sides and up in between her
legs. He continued going up Patient 3’s legs until he reached her vagina. When she testified,
Patient 3 noted that the Respondent did not say anything about what he was doing or why he was
doing it when he got to her vagina. Once at Patient 3’s vagina, he pressed twice on one side of it
and then twice on the other side of it. Patient 3 was disturbed by what the Respondent had done.
She testified that she told him, “I do not like where you're at.” Despite Patient 3’s protests, the

Respondent continued pressing in and around Patient 3’s vaginal region.
