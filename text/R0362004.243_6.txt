Ms. Cook-Pulizzotto’s conduct. Panel A is not confident that Ms. Cook-Pulizzotto fully
recognizes the extent of her difficulties or that she has taken sufficient steps to mitigate stressors
that led to her most recent violation based on the evidence presented by the parties at the show
cause hearing. Nor is the Panel reassured that she can properly adhere to MPRP’s requirements
without gaining more serious insight into her own risk factors. Accordingly, Panel A will impose
a suspension of her radiography license with the goal of allowing her to focus on meaningful
rehabilitation.
