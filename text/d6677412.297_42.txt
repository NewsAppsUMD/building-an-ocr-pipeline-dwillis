 

- examination of Patient 2. He averred that, “It shows an incredible lack of judgment to proceed
with an examination without a chaperone.” (Test. a. at 552; State’s Ex. 50.)
97. During the October 28, 2014 meeting, > asked if the Respondent

recalled their earlier conversation about the need to use chaperones. The Respondent nodded in

agreement. oof at 552; State’s Ex. 50.)
98. On November 7, 2014, the Senior Benefits Administrator for P|

sent a letter to the Respondent, verifying the Respondent’s termination from his employment,
effective October 28, 2014, and informing him of medical and dental benefits that might be
available to him after his termination through the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act (COBRA). (State’s Ex. 7 at 071-076.)

99. ° Because he was terminated without ninety days advance notice, the Respondent
knew or should have known nf terminated him for cause. (State’s Ex. 7 at
0040-0041.) : .
Findings with Respect to Patient 38

100. Patient 3 is a forty-eight-year-old woman. She suffers from two medical
conditions, Amold-Chiria Type 2 malformation and degenerated cervical discs, which cause her
to experience severe, chronic and constant back pain. (State’s Bx. 44 at 00001.)

101. An Arnold-Chiria Type 2 malformation is a congenital condition that involves a
malformity around the skull. (Test. Patient 3, T. at 28.)

102. Patient 3 had nuts and bolts implanted in her spine to address the degeneration of

her cervical discs. (Test. Patient 3, T. at 28.)

8 Patients 3 through 7 experienced acts of inappropriate touching by the Respondent votre
terminated the Respondent’s employment. Because these acts of inappropriate touching only became known to the
Board after the Respondent's termination, however, I decided to address them here rather than earlier in my
Proposed Findings of Fact, even though they are chronologically out of sequence.
