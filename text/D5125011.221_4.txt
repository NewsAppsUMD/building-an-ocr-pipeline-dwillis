communication with the Board.

On or about April 22, 2019, the Board received an anonymous complaint from a
pharmacist alleging that Dr. Kass was engaging in improper and unlawful prescribing
practices. The complaint alleged, in pertinent part, that Dr. Kass was prescribing
controlled dangerous substances (“CDS”) to a family member (“Family Member A”).?
The Board initiated an investigation into the complaint, and subpoenaed prescription
records and medical records. A Board investigator also notified Dr. Kass of the
allegations, the Board’s subsequent investigation, and requested that Dr. Kass provide
a written response and participate in an under-oath interview.

As part of its investigation, the Board, on or about May 29, 2019, subpoenaed Dr.
Kass’s prescription records through the Maryland Prescription Drug Monitoring
Program to review his recent prescribing history.

The Board obtained a report of Dr. Kass’s prescribing history that documented his
prescribing of medications, including CDS, for Family Member A. The Board also
obtained copies of the prescriptions.

The prescription records showed that between April 7, 2014 and May 5, 2018, Dr. Kass
wrote Family Member A sixteen prescriptions for three different CDS. Four of the
prescriptions authorized five refills.

The Board also received information that Dr. Kass prescribed medications for Family
member A that were intended for and used by another family member (‘Family

Member B”).

3 The American Medical Association (“AMA”) Code of Medical Ethics, specifically Opinion 1.2.1 Treating Self or
Family, opines that physicians should, except in emergency settings and/or for short-term minor problems, not treat
family members because it poses several challenges to physicians including concerns about professional objectivity,
patient autonomy, and informed consent.
