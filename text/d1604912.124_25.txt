member’s death. The Exit Guide discusses the logistics and timing of “discovering” the
member’s body and reporting the death. The Exit Guide also rehearses the death event with
the member.

The Organization does not require that Exit Guides and Senior Exit Guides be physicians,

and to the Respondent’s knowledge, he was the only physician who acted in such capacity.

. The inhaled helium displaces the oxygen in the body and initiates brain death.

After a few minutes, the Exit Guide announces that death has occurred. After the tanks have
emptied, the Exit Guide removes the bag, detaches it from the tanks and places the tanks in

their boxes, ready to be disposed of.

. The Exit Guide reminds the person who has agreed to “discover” the body to wait at least

two hours before making the discovery. The passage of time permits the body to cool and
discourages attempts at resuscitation.

Death by inhalation of helium is not detectable when the body is autopsied.

The Respondent was present at six suicides in Maryland. Four occurred in 2008, one in
2006 and one in 2004.

None of the six suicide members had a terminal condition, in that they were not facing
imminent death within six months.

When interviewed by Board staff, the Respondent stated that he was an Exit Guide at each
of the suicides and that he “always” performed a rehearsal of the procedure prior to the
“death event.”

I find the following additional facts by a preponderance of the Evidence:

. First Responders are Organization members who initially interview individuals who are

interested in becoming an Organization members and ending their lives.
