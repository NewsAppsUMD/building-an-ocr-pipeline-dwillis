between man and man.’” Afforney Grievance Comm’n of Md. v. Walman, 280 Md. 453, 459
(quoting Braverman y, Bar Ass’n of Balt. City, 209 Md. 328, 344, cert. denied, 352 U.S. 830
(1956)).

The elements of second-degree assault are: (1) that Dr. Torres caused offensive physical
contact and (2) that the contact was intentional or reckless, not accidental and the contact was not
consented to by the person. In this case, the subject of the assault was an eighteen-year-old female
patient of Dr. Torres who was seen by Dr. Torres, her pediatrician, alone, without a chaperone, for
anxiety attacks. Dr. Torres abused his position of power and sexually touched the patient without
her consent for no accepted medical purpose. The eighteen-year-old female patient was especially
vulnerable in that Dr. Torres had been her pediatrician her entire life, she was unaccompanied at
the office for the first time in her life, and she placed her trust in him to help her cope with her
anxiety attacks.

The elements of fourth-degree sexual offense are: (1) that Dr. Torres had sexual contact
with an individual and (2) that sexual contact was made against the will and without the consent
of the individual. The individual, again, was the same female patient, who was the subject of the
second-degree assault. Sexual contact, as it applies to this case, is defined as an intentional
touching of the victim’s genital area for sexual arousal or gratification or for abuse of either party
that is not for any accepted medical purpose.

Dr. Torres cites no case law or support for his argument that fourth-degree sexual offense
is not a crime involving moral turpitude. Dr. Torres cites the case of Rudman v. Maryland State
Board of Physicians, 414 Md. 243 (2010) and argues that second-degree assault is not a crime
involving moral turpitude. In Rudman, the Board revoked the license of Dr. Rudman based on his

Alford plea to second-degree assault. The Court explained:
