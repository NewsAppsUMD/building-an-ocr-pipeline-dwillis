4, On or about October 22, 2021, the Board received a complaint (the “Complaint”)
from a manager (the “Complainant”) at the Staffing Agency.

5. The Complainant stated that the Staffing Agency required employees to receive a
COVID-19 vaccination, and the Complainant suspected that the Respondent submitted a
fraudulent COVID-19 vaccine card due to, among other things, the dates that vaccinations were
administered and the handwriting on the vaccine card. The Complaint further stated that the
Staffing Agency requested that the Respondent provide state verification of her COVID-19
vaccination, which she did not. The Respondent then became “unresponsive” to the Staffing
Agency.

6. Upon receiving the Complaint, the Board initiated an investigation of the
Respondent.

Ill. Board Investigation

7. As part of its investigation, the Board subpoenaed records, including, but not
limited to, the Respondent’s human resources/personnel file from the Staffing Agency and the
Respondent’s COVID-19 vaccination records from a Maryland database.

Falsification of COVID-19 Vaccination

8. The Board received a copy of the COVID-19 vaccine card the Respondent
submitted to the Staffing Agency, which stated that the Respondent received two doses of a
COVID-19 vaccination: on January 19, 2021, and on February 2, 2021.

9. In or around November 19, 2021, the Board was notified that the Maryland database
had no record of the Respondent receiving a COVID-19 vaccination.
