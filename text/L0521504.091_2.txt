 

name, the purpose of the call, and that the ALJ would continue to call until 9:15 a.m. Mr. Lee did
not answer the phone on any one of the phone calls and after waiting fifteen minutes, the
administrative prosecutor moved for an Order of Default.

After the telephone prehearing conference concluded, the Docket Specialist informed the
ALI that Mr. Lee had called and stated that he was still awaiting the telephone call. Mr. Lee did
not ask for a postponement or provide a different telephone number where he could be reached.
The ALJ found that Mr. Lee had ample opportunity to answer the calls between 9:00 a.m. and 9:15
a.m. and that he failed to attend the prehearing conference.

Under OAH’s rules of procedure, “{iJf, after receiving proper notice, a party fails to attend
or participate in a prehearing conference, hearing, or other stage of a proceeding, the judge may
proceed in that party’s absence or may, in accordance with the hearing authority delegated by the
agency, issue a final or proposed default order against the defaulting party.” COMAR
28.02.01.23A.

On December 9, 2020, the ALJ issued a Proposed Default Order. The ALJ found that Mr.
Lee had proper notice of the December 7, 2020 prehearing conference and that he failed to appear
or participate in the prehearing conference. The ALJ proposed that the Panel find Mr. Lee in
default, adopt as findings of fact the statements set out in the allegations of fact section of the
charges and conclude as a matter of law that Mr. Lee violated Health Occ. § 14-5A-17(a)(1), (3),
(10), and (26) in the manner set forth in the charges. The ALJ proposed that Mr. Lee be
reprimanded, ordered to pay a $500 civil penalty, required to complete his State and Federal CHRC
within 45 days to avoid further disciplinary action, and subject to any other disciplinary action that

the Board determines is appropriate.
