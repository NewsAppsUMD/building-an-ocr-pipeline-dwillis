investigatory file, the documentation provided by Dr. Dooley, the peer reviews, and Dr. Dooley’s
response, a disciplinary panel of the Board voted to charge Dr. Dooley in this case.

The case was forwarded to the Office of Administrative Hearings (“OAH”) for an
evidentiary hearing and a proposed decision. At the hearing, the State presented testimony from
Thelma Wright, M.D. (“Dr. Wright”), one of the Board-certified peer reviewers, who was
qualified as an expert in pain medicine.' Dr. Dooley did not object to Dr. Wright being qualified
as an expert and, in fact, stated that he was “honored Dr. Wright has taken the time to read [his]
charts.” Dr. Dooley cross-examined each of the State’s witnesses and testified at length on his
own behalf, but he did not present any other witnesses, expert or otherwise.? The State
submitted the medical records and patient summaries that Dr. Dooley provided to the Board, and
Dr. Dooley’s responses to the complaints and the peer reviews, which were admitted into
evidence by the Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”).

After a three day hearing at OAH, the ALJ issued a proposed decision on July 2, 2015,
concluding that Dr. Dooley failed to meet appropriate standards as determined by peer review for
the delivery of quality medical care for ten patients, Patients A-J, in violation of Health Occ. §
14-404(a)(22). In doing so, the ALJ proposed that the charges be upheld and recommended a
one-year suspension followed by three years of probation with conditions to be determined by a
Board disciplinary panel. The ALJ also proposed that Dr. Dooley permanently terminate his

pain management practice and that he be prohibited from prescribing opioid medications.

' Dr. Wright is the Medical Director of the Pain Management Center and the Director of the Pain Fellowship
Program at the University of Maryland.

? Dr. Dooley was represented by counsel during pre-hearing proceedings before the Board, but chose to represent
himself at the OAH hearing.
