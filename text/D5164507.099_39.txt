Respondent during a therapy session why he was rushing her through it, and the Respondent
replied he had retarded people waiting for him and they “tend to get agitated.” Patient 2 made
the same statements during the Board’s interview of her. Patient 2 also told the Board that
Patient 1 said the Respondent told her he felt sorry for Patient 2.

The Respondent specifically denied calling al or any patient in his waiting room
retarded. He explained: “That’s a word, no, the answer is no, That’s not a word that I use or

_would use to describe people.” He further testified: “We moved away from that diagnostic word,
it’s now intellectually disabled, and it, the word is, is used in a derogatory way. It’s just not
appropriate.” .

Based on-my observation of Patient 2. during her testimony, and on my review of her
testimony and. statements to the Board, I find Patient 2 to have been a credible witness. I give
her testimony significant probative weight. Accordingly, I find that the Respondent referred to
patients in his waiting room as retarded and easily agitated.

In addition, L also find that the Respondent clic BH ctardea to Person | and
Patient 1, and he told Patient | he felt sorry for Patient 2 because of poe] J found above that
the Respondent used “retarded” to refer to patients in his office’s waiting room. There is no
evidence in the record from which to find that Patient 2 ever told Patient 1 or Person 1 that
Ea was the Respondent’s patient or that Patient 2 discussed Ea: medical status or
condition with either Patient 1 or Person 1. Aécordingly, I am persuaded that it is more likely
than not that the Respondent described pee retarded to both Patient 1 and Person 2.

_ Socializing and drinking wine at the hair salon with Person 1 and Patient 1
During the Board’s interview of Patient 1, she said that the Respondent drank wine with

her and Person 1 “over twenty times, maybe more than that.”
