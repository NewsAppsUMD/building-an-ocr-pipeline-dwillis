criminal offense had been expunged from the record, and that he held this belief in good faith

The court documents obtained by the Board from the Georgia State Court of Cobb
County established that Mr. Gbadamosi pled guilty to misdemeanor criminal trespass on
February 18, 2014, and was sentenced to 12 months confinement. Under the terms of a

reinstatement application - which made.no exception for expungement - and the evidence in the

Maryland hospital met with him on March 7, 2017 to discuss problems with Mr. Gbadamosi’s

patient care, punctuality, and responsiveness to colleagues and patients, The supervisor noted
