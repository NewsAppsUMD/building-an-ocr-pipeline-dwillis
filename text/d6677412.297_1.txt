hearing prior to the scheduled hearing date. Accordingly, the summary suspension remains in
effect.

On May 27, 2016, Disciplinary Panel B issued amended charges, which added the
allegations of four additional patients to the original charges, pursuant to the same disciplinary
grounds. The amended charges were forwarded to OAH for an evidentiary hearing and a
proposed decision. A six-day hearing was held before an ALJ at OAH. On February 13, 2017,
the ALJ issued a proposed decision concluding that Dr. Williams was guilty of unprofessional
and immoral conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3);
willfully made or filed a false report in the practice of medicine, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-
404(a)(11); and willfully made a false representation when seeking or making application for
licensure or any other application related to the practice of medicine, in violation of Health Occ.
§ 14-404(a)(36). The ALJ proposed that the amended charges be upheld and recommended the
permanent revocation of Dr. Williams’s medical license.

On March 6, 2017, Dr. Williams filed exceptions to the ALJ’s proposed decision, and the
State filed a response to Dr. Williams’s exceptions. On May 10, 2017, both parties appeared
before Disciplinary Panel A (“Panel A” or “the Panel’) of the Board for an exceptions hearing.
