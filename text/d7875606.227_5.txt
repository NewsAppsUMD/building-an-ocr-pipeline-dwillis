ALLEGATIONS OF FACT!

Disciplinary Panel B of the Board bases its charges on the following facts that it

has reason to believe are true:

1.

The Respondent was initially licensed to practice medicine in Maryland on
November 18, 2014. She retained licensure until February 24, 2017. (See
paragraph 8, below).

The Respondent is board-certified in family medicine.

Prior Disciplinary History

In or around September 2015, the Respondent began employment at a group
medical practice (“Practice A”) in Baltimore, Maryland.

On or about January 11, 2017, Practice A’s Medical Director reported to the
Board multiple instances of the Respondent's erratic behavior that adversely
affected patient care and was disruptive to the operation of the practice.

On January 20, 2017, Practice A relieved the Respondent of all duties.

The Respondent's duties were relieved based on observations of her erratic,
unprofessional and behaviorally disruptive conduct toward patients, including
pediatric patients, and staff.”

Panel B voted to summarily suspend the Respondent's license to practice
medicine in Maryland concluding that the public health, safety or welfare

imperatively requires emergency action.

' The statements of the Respondent's conduct herein are intended to provide the Respondent with notice
of the alleged charges. They are not intended as, and do not necessarily represent, a complete
description of the evidence, either documentary or testimonial, to be offered against the Respondent in
this matter.

2 To maintain confidentiality, specific instances of behavior will not be referenced in this document. The
Respondent has been notified by Practice A of its concerns. The Respondent may obtain from the
Administrative Prosecutor documents related to these instances.
