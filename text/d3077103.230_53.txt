Sanctions

The Board is Maryland’s “governmental agency responsible for investigating and
disciplining physicians for professional’ misconduct.” Cornfeld v. Board of. Physicians, 174 Md.
App. 456, 481 (2007). “The Board’s mission [is] to regulate the use of physician’s licenses in
Maryland in order to protect and preserve the public health.” Jd at 481 (internal quotations and
citations omitted). The purpose of the Board’s disciplinary authority is to protect the public, not
to punish physicians, McDonnell v, Comm. on Med. Disc., 301 Md, 426, 436 (1984).

COMAR 10.32,02.10(3)(a) provides that the maximum sanction for a violation of
COMAR 10.32,17.02 is revocation. The minimum sanction is a reprimand. Sanctions may also
include a fine, which would range from $10,000.00 to $50,000.00.

The Respondent’s.conduct in engaging in a sexual relationship with a patient he was treating
was immoral and unprofessional and constitutes sexual misconduct. It is behavior unbecoming a
licensed professional whose principle tenet of practice is to “do no harm.” The Respondent has no
other disciplinary violations and was cooperative with the investigation. However, not only was the
Respondent having sexual relations with a patient he was treating, but that patient was also involved
in managing the practice, which contributed to animosity in the work environment amongst
subordinates who found out about the relationship. The Respondent enrolled and successfully
completed courses regarding workplace ethics, sensitivity training and sexual harassment. The
Respondent has been summarily suspended since March 5, 2019. The patient with whom the -
Respondent was having sexual relations was not harmed, Weighing the mitigating and
aggravating factors in COMAR 10,32.02.09B, I recommend that the Board suspend the
Respondent’s license to practice medicine for a period of one year, retroactive to March 5, 2019, the
date the Respondent was summarily suspended, Further, I recommend a fine of $10,000.00. This

recommended sanction falls within the guidelines,
