ineffective legal counsel. He said that he believed it should have veer Hospitar’s

altering the medical record. He stated that he entered into the Consent Order because, at the
time, he “wanted to sign the paper and be done with it.” (Transcript Vol. I, pg. 54). On cross-
examination, he explained that at the time of the incident, he was working for the hospital in a

_ remote office and that he felt it was the hospital’s responsibility to ensure the office was
equipped in the same way that a doctor who worked on the hospital campus would not be
responsible for ensuring the hospital had x-ray machines and syringes. (Transcript Vol, Il, pgs.

~ 50-54; 80-83).
