On cross-examination Dr vas asked about AMA Opinion 8.19. Opinion 8.19
states that physicians generally should not treat members of their immediate family because
“professional objectivity” and “medical judgment” can be compromised by the physician's
personal feelings. It may be uncomfortable for the physician “to probe sensitive areas when
taking the history” or perform a full intimate examination, and the patient may not disclose
“sensitive information” or want to undergo “intimate examination” because of the familial
relationship. Physicians “may be inclined to treat problems that are beyond their expertise or
training.” Tensions could arise in the professional and personal relationship if there is a
“negative medical outcome.” “Concerns regarding patient autonomy and informed consent” may
result in the patient not seeking a second opinion or going forward with a procedure so as not to
offend the family member. Similarly, the physician “may feel obligated to provide care to a
family member...” There are exceptions for an “emergency” or “isolated settings” where uo
other qualified physician is available, or some “situations in which routine care is acceptable for
short-term, minor problems,” (Bd. Ex. 10.)
