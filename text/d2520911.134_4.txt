CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Dr. McLean committed crimes of moral turpitude. He was convicted of knowingly and
willfully submitting false and fraudulent bills to Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers. He did
so in order to obtain payment for these services, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §1347, a statute whose
essential elements include a scheme to defraud and an intent to defraud. His actions included, but
are not limited to, implanting unnecessary cardiac stents in more than 100 patients; falsely
recording in patients’ medical records the existence or extent of coronary artery blockages;
submitting fraudulent claims to health benefit programs; and ordering his patients to undergo a
battery of unnecessary follow up tests such as Cardiolite Stress Tests; echocardiograms and
EKGs.

If fraud or an intent to defraud is an essential element of a statute under which a
defendant is convicted, the crime is one involving moral turpitude as a matter of law. Attorney
Grievance Commission v. Klauber, 289 Md. 446, 457-59, cert. denied, 451 U.S. 1018 (1981)
(the term “moral turpitude” connotes a fraudulent or dishonest intent); Attorney Grievance
Comm'n v. Walman, 280 Md. 453, 459-60 (1977)(a crime of moral turpitude is characterized by
dishonesty, fraud, or deceit); Oltman v. Maryland State Board of Physicians, 162 Md. App. 453,
485-87, cert. denied, 389 Md. 125 (2005) (crime was one of moral turpitude [because] it was
dishonest, and characterized by fraud); see also Board of Physician Quality Assurance vy.

Felsenberg, 351 Md. 288, 295 (1998)(crimes involving fraud are crimes involving moral

turpitude).
