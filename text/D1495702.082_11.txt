SANCTION

The ALJ proposed revoking Dr. Smith’s license. The ALJ noted no mitigating factors,
under COMAR 10.32.02.09B(5), and noted eight aggravating factors under COMAR
10.32.02.09B(6). These include: Dr. Smith’s prior disciplinary history with the Board; the
offense was conducted deliberately; the offense had the potential for harm; the offense was part
of a pattern of detrimental conduct; the patient was especially vulnerable; Dr. Smith attempted to
hide the misconduct from others; Dr. Smith presented false testimony; and Dr. Smith did not
cooperate with the investigation. Additionally, Dr. Smith’s concealment of his relationship with
Patient B led the Board to impose a less stringent sanction when he was disciplined for his sexual
relationship with Patient A because the Board believed it was an isolated incident. Had he been
honest during his prior Board investigation and had the Board been informed that Dr. Smith’s
boundary violation was not an isolated event, but was part of a pattern of similar misconduct, it
is likely that the Board would have imposed a significantly harsher sanction. The ALJ further
noted that Dr. Smith has shown little insight as to the severity of his actions and failed to
acknowledge any wrongdoing.

Before the Panel, Dr. Smith argued that the Panel should not revoke his license because
the Program determined that he was safe to practice with certain restrictions on his license and
that revoking his license would harm the public because there is a shortage of endocrinologists.
The State responded by explaining that the Program’s recommendation was made without the
knowledge that Dr. Smith would subsequently disavow his admissions of wrongdoing.

The Panel finds the ALJ’s reasoning and the State’s arguments persuasive. Dr. Smith’s
violations are significant and demonstrate a troubling pattern of conduct. Rather than a single

isolated instance of boundary crossing, Dr. Smith has demonstrated a pattern of detrimental
