Re: Surrender of License to Practice Medicine
Kamakshi Neelkantan, M.D.
License Number: D24744
Case Number: 7722-0029

Dear Dr. Olszyk and Members of Disciplinary Panel A:

Please be advised that, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. (“Health Oce.”) §14-403
(2021 Repl. Vol.), I have decided to SURRENDER my license to practice medicine in the State
of Maryland, License Number D24744, effective immediately. I understand that upon surrender
of my license, I may not practice medicine, with or without compensation, in the State of
Maryland as it is defined in the Maryland Medical Practice Act (the “Act”), Health Occ. §§
14-101 et seg, and other applicable laws. In other words, as of the effective date of this Letter of
Surrender, I understand that the surrender of my license means that I am in the same position as
an unlicensed individual in the State of Maryland.

I understand that this Letter of Surrender is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT, and upon
Disciplinary Panel A’s (“Panel A”) acceptance, becomes a FINAL ORDER of Panel A of the
Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board’).

I acknowledge that the Board initiated an investigation of my practice and on May 14,
2021, Panel A issued disciplinary charges against me under Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(22) (fails to
meet the appropriate standards as determined by appropriate peer review for the delivery of
quality medical care in this State) and (40) (Fails to keep adequate medical records as determined
by appropriate peer review). I resolved these disciplinary charges through a Consent Order with
Panel A, dated September 14, 2021, in which Panel A found that I had violated Health Occ. §
14-404(a)(22) and (40). The Consent Order reprimanded me, placed me on probation for a
minimum of two (2) years, required that I successfully complete courses in medication-assisted
treatment and recordkeeping, required that I be supervised by a Panel-approved supervisor who is
board-certified in addiction medicine, and required that I pay a fine of $2,500.00 within two years
of the effective date of the Consent Order.

After issuing two extensions for me to find a supervisor to comply with the 2021 Consent
Order, the Panel issued an order of suspension, on February 22, 2022, in accordance with the
terms of the 2021 Consent Order.. (Attached as Exhibit 1). On March 23, 2022, Panel A issued a
Violation of Board Order and Notice to Show Cause alleging that I violated the supervisory
