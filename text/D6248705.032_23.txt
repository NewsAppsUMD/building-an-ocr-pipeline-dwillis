relationship between the patient and Dr. Schnitzlein after she was discharged from the hospital on °

January 18, 2019. In the complaint, the psychologist described text messages she reviewed
between the patient and Dr. Schnitzlein, some of which discussed meeting at a nearby hotel where
Dr. Schnitzlein was staying. The patient told the psychologist that she met Dr. Schnitzlein at the
hotel for “treatment, swimming, conversation, and sex.”

In July, 2019, the Board received a complaint from the patient who alleged having a
personal relationship with Dr. Schnitzlein after he had treated her at the hospital. The patient said
that Dr. Schnitzlein suggested that they exchange personal cell phone numbers so they could
communicate after her discharge, and described her various encounters with him at his hotel where
they swam in the hotel pool, kissed in an outside whirlpool, and engaged in multiple sex acts in
his hotel room. The patient explained that as she recovered, she “understood the gravity of [his]
behavior,” and began to have negative flashbacks to her encounters with Dr. Schnitzlein which
prompted her discussion of their relationship with her psychologist.

In addition to reviewing the complaints from the psychologist and the patient, the Board’s
investigation included obtaining text messages between the patient and Dr. Schnitzlein, the
patient’s medical records from the hospital, voicemails left for the patient from Dr. Schnitzlein in
August, 2019, written responses from Dr. Schnitzlein to the Board, and interviews of the
psychologist, the patient, and Dr. Schnitzlein.
