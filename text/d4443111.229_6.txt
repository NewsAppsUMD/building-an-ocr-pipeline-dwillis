The Respondent began by using the stethoscope over the top of Patient C's shirt, around
her chest. He then asked the patient for permission to put his stethoscope under her shirt. After
Patient C agreed, the Respondent used the stethoscope around Patient Câ€™s chest, under her shirt.
The Respondent then stopped using the stethoscope and reached under Patient C's shirt and bra,
and, using one hand, he cupped her breasts one at a time, moving from one breast to the other
several times, back and forth. Occasionally, the Respondent lifted Patient C's shirt with his other
hand and looked underneath the shirt. The nature of the Respondent's touching of Patient C's
breasts was intentional and sexual. He did not explain why he was touching her in this manner,
and there was no medical justification for touching the patient's breasts in this manner. He spoke
to Patient C's mother at the same time, who could not sce what he was doing.

When the Respondent left the examination room, Patient C told her mother that the
Respondent felt her breasts inappropriately. She was crying and upset. Patient C never returned
to the Respondent's office.

Later that day, Patient C and her mother went to their family physician and inquired as to
the proper method for a lung or chest examination. A nurse at the family physician's office
explained how such an-examination should be conducted, which did not include cupping the
breasts.

Alter visiting the office of their family physician, Patient C and her mother went to the
police department to report the Respondent's conduct. They were directed to the Carroll County
Advocacy and Investigation Center ("CCAIC") so an investigation could proceed.

Still later that day, the Respondent catled Patient C's mother to inquire about Patient C.
