The pertinent provisions of the Board’s regulations, Md. Code Regs. 10.32.02.14
provide:

.14 Proposed Orders; ...

A. Nothing in this chapter prohibits the issuance of a charging
document with a proposed order which will go into effect if the
respondent fails to request a hearing.

FINDINGS OF FACT
Panel A finds the following:

1. At all times relevant hereto, the Respondent was and is licensed as a R.T.
in the State of Maryland. The Respondent was initially licensed as an R.T. in Maryland
on August 21, 2008, under License Number 000587. The Respondent's license is
currently active and is scheduled for renewal on April 30, 2019.

2. On or about March 12, 2017, the Respondent initiated the process of
applying for renewal of her radiation therapy license for the 2017 renewal period using
the Board's online renewal application process. When a licensee applies online to
renew his/her license, a notice appears that informs the licensee that the Board may not
renew a license if it has not received the licensee's Criminal History Record Check
("CHRC") information, which includes the licensee's submission of his/her fingerprints to
the Criminal Justice Information Services ("CJIS") before attempting to complete the
renewal application.

3. The Respondent submitted her online application (the "Application") on or
about March 12, 2017, along with the required renewal fee. The Application the
Respondent signed states, "Failure to submit to a... [CHRC].. . may result in
disciplinary action." When submitting her online Application, the Respondent checked a
box attesting that she completed her CHRC.
