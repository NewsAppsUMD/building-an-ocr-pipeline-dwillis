persuaded by Dr. Singhal’s expert. Though noting that Dr. Singhal minimized the fact that he
was attracted to Patient 1’s wife, the ALJ found that Dr. Singhal’s prior professional and social
relationship with Patient 1’s wife, as a former coworker, and their keeping in touch as friends

The Panel rejects Dr. Singhal’s attempts to detract from his duties as Patient 1’s
psychiatrist because of his prior existing relationship with Patient 1’s wife. The APA
Commentary on Ethics in Practice § 3.2.6 states that a psychiatrist “must avoid patient

this is not limited to sexual or financial relationships, “non-sexual social relationships may
negatively affect the therapeutic relationship.”

Here, both Patient 1 and Patient 1’s wife recall that Dr. Singhal initiated the encounter

social encounter with a patient. Second, taking Patient 1’s wife, to whom he was sexually
attracted, on a long car ride, was inappropriate. Dr. Singhal’s discussing with her his dream of

the car ride, he certainly imparted on her that he had thoughts about her. The Panel finds that Dr.

Finally, all the fact witnesses recall that Patient | was upset because of the lengthy car

tide, Dr. Singhal dismissed the critique. The Panel finds that Dr. Singhal did not prioritize
