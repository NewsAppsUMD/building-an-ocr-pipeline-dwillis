he recalls doing “pediatric gastroenterology patients, kids’ colonoscopies or
endoscopies.” He stated, “I don’t recall exactly what my interactions were. | know I was

he had been sober for two and a half years prior to his relapse on April 4, 2022.

Facility. It’s not obviously something I am proud of. I’m scared.”
