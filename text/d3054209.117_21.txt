 

The Respondent argued a one-year suspension of his license to practice would wreak a
significant negative effect not only on him, but on his patients. In addition to his private —
practice, the Respondent also volunteers a substantial amount of his time to. serving as the
primary clinician for the p a Christian, non-profit shelter that.
services approximately 243 homeless clients in Baltimore City J: clientele is diverse, with
multiple ethnicities and religious faiths represented among those to whom the shelter provides
services. The Respondent is the. director ey medical clinic. On a weekly basis, he
supervises approximately ten to fifteen medical students in providing medical care 7 s
clients. Lf the Respondent were to be suspended for a year, his private practice would close, as
would: medical clinic. In short, a suspension of the Respondent’s license hurts, rather
than helps, the public. The Respondent was willing to accept a referral to the MPRP, and was
willing to undergo any other rehabilitative or remedial pro: gramming recommended by the

Analysis
Unprofessional Conduct in the Practice of Medicine

I note at the outset there is no dispute between the parties that the Respondent was a
licensed physician who was on duty and attending to his professional obligations on December 5,
2015 and February 22,2016. There is further no dispute that the Respondent engaged in some
form of verbal confrontation with S.W. on December 5, 2015 and with S.B. on February 22,
2016, that resulted in (1) him locking their clients in his examination room, out of their reach and
sight; and, (2) both women calling the police to aid in de-escalating the situation. At the heart of
this case lies the question of whether the Respondent’s conduct is properly characterized as

unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine on one or both of the dates in question.
