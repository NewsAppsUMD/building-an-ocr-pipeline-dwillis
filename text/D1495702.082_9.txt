Dr. Smith has since disclaimed his prior statement to the Program and to the Board,
claiming that he made “the same misstatement in two different places.” Dr. Smith’s excuse is
that he did not review the records before his meeting with the Program, so had not been able to-
check when the sexual relationship ended. However, this excuse does not explain why he made
the same statement admitting to the overlapping sexual relationship and medical treatment in his
letter to the Board that was written when he could review his records. The Panel rejects this self-
serving claim that the prior statements were misstatements. Dr. Smith’s version of events only
changed after he was charged and thereby informed that such relationships were unethical and a
potential violation of the Medical Practice Act. The Panel adopts the ALJ’s conclusion that Dr.
Smith’s treatment of Patient B overlapped with their sexual relationship. Dr. Smith’s exception
is denied.

4. Dr. Smith’s Statement to the Board Investigators was False.

The remaining charges of making a false report and a failure to cooperate with’ the
Board’s investigation concern Dr. Smith’s false answer to the question asked during his Board
interview related to his sexual relationship with Patient A. When asked “Did you ever have any
kind of personal relationship with any other patients that you were treating?” Dr. Smith stated:
“No.” This answer was later discovered to be false because, as discussed above, Dr. Smith
admitted that he treated Patient B during his sexual relationship with her.

Dr. Smith argues in his exceptions that he did not have a sexual relationship concurrent
with his treatment of Patient B and therefore his statement to the investigators was correct. As
discussed above, the Panel finds that his sexual relationship did overlap with the patient-

physician relationship and this answer was, therefore, incorrect and untruthful.
