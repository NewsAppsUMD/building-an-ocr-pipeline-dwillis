ORDER ON APPLICATION FOR REINSTATEMENT
OF MEDICAL LICENSURE AFTER REVOCATION

 

I. PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL HISTORY

From 2010 until 2014, Bryan §. Williams, M.D., worked as an interventional pain
management specialist. The Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”) received a
complaint that he inappropriately touched female patients. Based on evidence revealed during
the Board’s investigation and presented at Dr. Williams’s six-day evidentiary hearing, the Board
found that Dr. Williams violated several provisions of the Medical Practice Act by touching four
patients in or around their sexualized body parts and misrepresenting his termination from his
employment on subsequent employment and Board renewal applications.

On December 29, 2017, Disciplinary Panel A (the “Panel” or “Panel A”) of the Board
issued a Final Decision and Order concluding that Dr. Williams violated the following provisions
of the Medical Practice Act, Md. Health Occ. Code Ann. § 14-404(a)(3)(i) and (ii) — immoral
and unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, due to his violation of the Board sexual
misconduct regulations COMAR 10.32.17 for four patients; § 14-404(a)(11) — willfully making
or filing a false report or record in the practice of medicine; and § 14-404(a)(36) — willfully
making a false representation when seeking or making application for licensure or any other
application related to the practice of medicine. Based on these violations, the Board revoked Dr.

Williams’s medical license.
