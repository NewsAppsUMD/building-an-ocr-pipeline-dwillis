38, On November 30, 2020, the Board received two complaints from Complainant 2
against the Respondent. In the first November 30, 2020 complaint (dated November 19, 2020),
Complainant 2 described an incident in which the Respondent slapped the buttocks of Patient 1.
In the second November 30, 2020 complaint (dated November 19, 2020), she stated that the
Respondent was inappropriate when examining her for lower back pain. On December 29, 2020,
the Board received a third complaint (dated Nov. 19, 2020) from Complainant 2 against the
Respondent, detailing an instance when Complainant 2 was orienting a new surgical technologist
at the Hospital and the Respondent stroked her neck. Complainant 2 felt “extremely
uncomfortable” and “embarrassed.” The complaint also indicated that the Respondent touched
her multiple times a day when they worked together, that she did not like it, and that she did not
know what to do about it.

39. On July 2, 2021, Disciplinary Panel A of the Board issued the Respondent the
Order for Summary Suspension of License to Practice Medicine.

40. | The Respondent presented a substantial likelihood of risk of serious harm to the
public health, safety and welfare. Thus, the order for summary suspension was imperatively

required to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, under State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2).

Il, CREDIBILITY
The Respondent did not testify at the OAH hearing, but, on May 21, 2021, and, on May
25, 2021, he was interviewed by Board compliance analysts. When the Respondent was
interviewed by the Board’s compliance analysts, he denied slapping or spanking Patient 1’s
buttocks. He said that he was pushing the tissue on her buttocks to show the O.R. staff where to
place the frame of a navigational instrument, indicating that the frame should not be placed on

fatty tissue where it would be unstable. The Panel does not find his denial credible.
