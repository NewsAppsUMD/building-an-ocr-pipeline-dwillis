Person 1 testified that the Respondent visited her and Patient.1 at the hair salon where
they talked about “everything” as if they were “family.” She did not-testify that they drank wine
together.

The Respondent specifically denied he had “drinks” with Patient 1 or Person 1 at the hair
salon. ,
| Patient 1’s statement that the Respondent drank wine while visiting the hair salon is not
corroborated. Person 1 did not testify that the Respondent drank wine with them. The only
evidence of that is Patient 1’s-statement during the interview. I am not persuaded by that
statement, alone, that the Respondent drank wine while visiting Patient 1 or Person | at the hair
salon. |

However, in regard to visiting the hair salon, both Person 1 and Patient 1 made
statements under oath that he did. In addition, the Respondent admitted to significant
involvement in the opening and ongoing operation of the salon. It was, he claimed, a possible
way out from under Person 1’s extortionist threats. Therefore, by his own account, he had a
financial interest to visit the salon. {In addition, the Respondent’s intimate relationship with
Person 1 also gave him a reason to visit the salon. Based on these reasons, I find that the .
Respondent visited the hair salon where he socialized with Patient 1 and Person 1.

Disclosure of confidential patient information .

Person 1 testified that the Respondent would “discuss his patients’ diagnoses” around
her. More specifically, Person 1 testified that the Respondent told her that Patient 2 was “OCD”
and “crazy.” In addition, Person | testified that the Respondent told her that Patient |’had a
“depréssional [sic] problem” and was'“a wreck trapped inside of a cage that’s radical, angry. If

she got out, she would, she would-destroy, she would kill.”
