EXCEPTIONS
I. RESPONDENT'S EXCEPTIONS CONCERNING PATIENT A

The Respondent took exception to numerous findings that the ALJ made concerning his
October 29, 2015, encounter with Patient A. The Respondent maintains that he did not grab, grope,
or squeeze Patient A's breasts. The focus of the Respondent's exceptions was on the ALJ's
credibility determinations and on the ALJ's factual findings that, during the October 29, 2015,
visit, Patient A did not complain of chest pain and Patient A's father did not enter the examination

room.
