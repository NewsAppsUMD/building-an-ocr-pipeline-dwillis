dispensing regulations, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii), (£2), (28), and violated the

_ Ina 2016 Consent Order, Disciplinary Panel B of the Board found that Dr. Epstein failed
to wear gloves during a pelvic examination and failed to wash his hands prior to pelvic

of unprofessional conduct, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii), and that he violated the
2014 Consent Order. |

The Panel takes into consideration that one of the aggravating factors when determining a
sanction is that “[p]revious attempts to rehabilitate the offender were unsuccessful.” COMAR
10.32.02.09.B(6)(k). This Final Decision and Order is the fifth time in 13 years that Dr. Epstein
has been disciplined by the Board or by a Board Panel. The Board has given Dr. Epstein
numerous chances to remedy his conduct and demonstrate that he can practice in a professional
