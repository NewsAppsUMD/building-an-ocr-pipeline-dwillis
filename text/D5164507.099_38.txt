Patient 1’s statements during the Board’s interview are.reliable hearsay because they are
sworn statements, and the Respondent had an opportunity to cross-examine Ms. Miller, the

substantial amounits of money to and on behalf of Person 1 and Patient 1. “Accordingly, 1 find
that the Respondent paid Patient 1 to babysit Person 1’s children on a number of occasions.

1’s son’s funeral expenses. . .
