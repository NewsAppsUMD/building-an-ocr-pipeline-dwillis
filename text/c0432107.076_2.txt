unwillingness to follow the program’s recommendations.

Cause alleging a violation of the Consent Order based on Ms. Cecil’s failure to comply with the
MPRP’s recommendations. On April 27, 2016, Ms. Cecil appeared at a Show Cause hearing
before Panel B. At the hearing, Ms. Cecil conceded that she did not comply with the MPRP’s
treatment recommendations and that she violated the September 10, 2015 Consent Order. She

advocated for the revocation of Ms. Cecil’s license based on the undisputed violation of the
Consent Order.
