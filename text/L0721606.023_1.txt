On November 22, 2022, the Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) convened the First
Scheduling Conference. The Administrative Prosecutor from the Office of the Attorney General
appeared and represented the State of Maryland. The Respondent did not appear. After waiting
over fifteen minutes for the Respondent or her representative to appear and having determined that
the Respondent received proper notice of the First Scheduling Conference, the ALJ went forward
in the Respondent’s absence. On November 30, 2022, the ALJ issued the First Scheduling Order,
scheduling a remote prehearing conference (“Prehearing Conference”) on Webex for 9:30 a.m., on
January 26, 2023; a remote merits hearing on Webex for 9:30 a.m., on February 23-24, 2023; and
discovery deadlines based, in part, on the first hearing date. Based on information obtained at the

the Respondent (which was a second address in Mississippi). The First Scheduling Order sent to
the Respondent was not returned by USPS,

notices mailed by OAH to the parties were returned by USPS, and there was no request for a
postponement of the Prehearing Conference. The State filed its prehearing. conference statement
