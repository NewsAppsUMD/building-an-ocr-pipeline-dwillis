FINDINGS OF FACT

Because Panel A concludes that Mr. Wilson has defaulted, the following findings of fact
are adopted from the allegations of fact set forth in the January 9, 2019 Charges Under the
Maryland Radiation Therapy, Radiography, Nuclear Medicine Technology, and Radiology
Assistance Act and are deemed proven by the preponderance of the evidence:

Mr. Wilson was initially licensed to practice radiography in the State of Maryland on
August 24, 2004. Mr. Wilson allowed his license to lapse in 2013 and subsequently submitted
an application for reinstatement. Mr. Wilson’s license was reinstated effective October 18,
2013.!

On or about April 5, 2017, Mr. Wilson submitted an online application (the
“Application”) for the renewal of Mr. Wilson’s license using the Board’s online renewal
application process, When a licensee applies online to renew his or her license, a notice appears
that informs the licensee that the Board may not renew a license if it has not received the
licensee’s Criminal History Record Check (“CHRC”) information, which includes the licensee's
submission of his or her fingerprints to the Criminal Justice Information Services (“CJIS”)
before attempting to complete the renewal application.

Mr. Wilson’s signed Application states, “Failure to submit to a [CHRC] may result in
disciplinary action.” When submitting the online Application, Mr. Wilson checked a box

attesting to completing the CHRC.

"Mr. Wilson’s license expired on April 30, 2019. Pursuant to section 14-5B-13 of the Health
Occupations Article, the license of an licensed radiographer may not “lapse by operation of law while the
licensee is under investigation or while charges are pending against a the licensee.” The Board’s
investigation began before the expiration of Mr. Wilson’s license. Therefore, by operation of law, Mr.
Wilson’s license did not expire during these proceedings.
