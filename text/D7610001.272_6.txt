He would fall asleep in his chair. He’d be sitting there at his
computer and just fall asleep. Then wake up easily when you say
something, but like, he falls asleep.

for some paperwork, slam her fists on the desk and tell the Respondent, who had fallen

asleep, to “wake up.”

Respondent Interview

24. On January 14, 2022, the Respondent was interviewed by Board staff under

oath with counsel present. The Respondent provided the following information:

a.

Following his knee surgery on May 5, 2021, he was prescribed
10-15 tablets of Percocet.

He returned to work on May 8, 2021.

On August 29, 2021, he went for a run and was experiencing
pain. At approximately 9:00pm, he took one Percocet and the
pain subsided. At approximately 1:00am on August 30, 2021, he
awoke in pain and took some Tylenol.

At approximately 2:00am, the Respondent explained that “I was
still up, I had a total shift in front of me and I — at that point...
made the wrong decision of going down{stairs] to take a shot of
whiskey. Actually, two.”

After arriving at work, he saw “maybe one or two patients” and
then fell asleep.

He was woken up by the Center Manager — “she just woke me up
to say, hey, we have some patients. That’s when I decided to see
patients again.”

He received approximately three (3) calls from the RMD telling
him to stop seeing patients.
