evidence is evenly balanced on an issue, the finding on that issue must be against the party who
bears the burden of proof. /d. For the reasons articulated below, with two exceptions to be
discussed, I find the State has satisfied its burden of proof to demonstrate the Respondent
violated the applicable statutory and regulatory provisions and, as a result, he is appropriately
subject to the imposition of sanctions.

convenient for the patients. The Respondent further had a habit of giving prescription
