but never received. He explained that rather than continue his attempts to resolve the problem, he
engaged in a vendetta against Amazon through the actions described in the plea agreement. Dr.
Riyaz claims that he has since sought treatment for his mental health condition and has paid
restitution in full. Dr. Riyaz argues that the crime he pled guilty to is not a crime involving moral
turpitude and asks the Board to refrain from revoking his license.

Under Health Occ. §14-404(b)(2), a disciplinary panel has the obligation and discretion
to determine what types of crimes are crimes involving moral turpitude for licensing and
disciplinary purposes, “[I]t is settled that whatever else [moral turpitude] may mean . . . a crime
in which an intent to defraud is an essential element is a crime involving moral turpitude. It is
also settled that the related group of offenses involving intentional dishonesty for purposes of
personal gain are crimes involving moral turpitude[.]” Attorney Grievance Comm'n of Md. v.
Walman, 280 Md. 453, 459-60 (1977). “[I]n the context of a licensing board’s review of the
conduct of its licensee, the concept of moral turpitude is rather broad.” Oltman v. Maryland State
Bad. Of Physicians, 162 Md. App. 457, 483 (2005).

“Determining whether an individual has been convicted of a crime involving moral
turpitude ‘necessarily begins with an examination of the criminal statute itself.” Burke v.
Maryland Bd. of Physicians, 250 Md. App. 334, 348 (2021) (quoting Walman, 280 Mad. at 460)).
“If the criminal statute does not establish moral turpitude on its face, then the analysis ‘hinges on
the facts present in the individual case at hand.” Jd. (quoting Walman, 280 Md. at 460)).
Maryland appellate courts have repeatedly held that if dishonesty, fraud, or intent to deceive is
an essential element of a statute under which a defendant is convicted, the crime involves moral
turpitude as a matter of law. See Board of Physician Quality Assurance v. Felsenberg, 351 Md.
