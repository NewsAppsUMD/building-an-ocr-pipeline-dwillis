The Respondent’s statements have been inconsistent on this matter. The Hospital’s Ad
Hoc Committee investigation report states that the Respondent “acknowledged the incident,
though he explained it by saying that he was not happy with the way the patient was taped,
removed the tape and moved the patient’s buttocks.” Individual 9 also said that the Respondent
was upset at how the patient was taped. The Respondent’s testimony during his interview with
the Board’s compliance analysts in which he stated that he was showing the O.R. staff where to
place a navigational instrument’s frame conflicts with his statement to the Hospital’s Ad Hoc
Committee.

Moreover, the Respondent’s version during his interview is contradicted by three
eyewitnesses to the incident: Complainant 2, Individual 5, and Individual 9. (Individual 5 did not
testify at the hearing, but she was interviewed by the Board’s compliance analysts.) The Panel
credits the testimony of Complainant 2, Individual 9, and Individual 5, who each testified that he
slapped and/or smacked the patient’s buttocks. Individual 9 said the Respondent was “joking
around” and sang the verse of “Baby Got Back.” (State’s Ex. 7, T. 18.) Complainant 2 testified
that the Respondent was making comments about how good [Patient 1] looked for her age, that
she was in great shape, and that her backside looked great. (T. 247.) Complainant 2 also testified
that she was “in complete disbelief.” (Jd.) Individual 5 testified, “it felt extremely
unprofessional and that’s why I reported it.” (State’s Ex. 15, T. 12.) There were some
differences with the details of the incidents between these three witnesses, but those
discrepancies are relatively minor and understandable considering how shocking the
Respondent’s conduct was to the witnesses.

Concerning Individual 4, when the Respondent was interviewed by the Board compliance

analysts, he denied the incident involving Individual 4 in which Individual 4 testified that the
