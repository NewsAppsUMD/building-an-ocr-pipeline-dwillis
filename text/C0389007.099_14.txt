DISCUSSION —

Legal Framework

Bven though the Board’s investigation of the Respondent was precipitated by Hospital
. A’s termination of her employment for patient care issues, this case is not about whether the
Respondent performed het duties within the standard of care for a physician assistant. In fact,
the Board declined to charge the Respondent with a standard of care violation. This case is
strictly about whether the Respondent worked without a delegation agreement on file with the
Board and, if so, whether: (1) that failure constitutes unprofessional conduct in the practice of
medicine in violation of the Health Occupations Article section 15-315(a)G Mii); and (2) the
Respondent is guilty of performing delegated medical acts without the supervision of a physician
in violation of Health Occupations Article section 15-315(a)(42). The State argues the
Respondent worked as a physician assistant without a delegation agreement, and therefore had
no supervising physician, from January 1, 2015 (after Physician A left Hospital A) until February
2017 (when the Respondent left her employment with Hospital A).

If the State proves the Board’s charges, the Respondent is subject to disciplinary action,
up to and including a reprimand, suspension or revocation of her physician assistant cerlification,
and a civil penalty. Jd. § 15-314(a). Moreover, a person who violates section. 15-401 “[s]hall lose
licensure as a physician assistant under this title.” Jd, §-15-403(a)(2), Section 15-401 (b) states,
“Except as otherwise provided in this title, a person may not perform, attempt to perform, or
offer to perform any delegated medical act beyond the scope of the license and which is

consistent with a delegation agreement filed with the Board.”

7T see no applicable exceptions, and the Respondent does not assert any.
