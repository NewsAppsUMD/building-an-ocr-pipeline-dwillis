a hearing is requested, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set the
hearing to begin within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08 I, though that 30-day
requirement may be waived.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel B resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is, therefore, a public document.

Sincerely,

Signature On File

Christine A. Farrelly, Ex√©cutiye Director [)
