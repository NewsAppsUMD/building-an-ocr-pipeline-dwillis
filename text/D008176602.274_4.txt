Board also emailed Dr. Malguria notice of the exceptions process. Neither party filed
exceptions, On January 10, 2024, this case came before Disciplinary Panel A (“Panel A”)
of the Board for final disposition.
FINDINGS OF FACT

Because Panel A concludes that Dr. Malguria has defaulted and has not filed
exceptions to the ALJ’s Proposed Default Order, the following findings of fact are adopted
from the allegations of fact in the charging document and are deemed proven by the
preponderance of the evidence:
I. Background/Licensing Information

medicine in the State of Maryland. The Respondent was initially licensed to practice
medicine in Maryland on May 20, 2016, under License Number D81766. The Respondent
failed to renew her license during the 2023 renewal period.!

2. The Respondent is board-certified in diagnostic radiology.

care facility (the “Facility”)? located in Maryland. The Respondent practiced at the Facility

summarily suspended her medical staff membership and clinical privileges (see 4, infra).

' The Respondent’s license expired on September 30, 2023. Pursuant to Health Occ. § 14-403(a), the Board
retains jurisdiction over the Respondent because a license “may not lapse by operation of law while the
individual is under investigation or while charges are pending.”
