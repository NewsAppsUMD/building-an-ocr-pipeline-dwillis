the Respondent had to have successfully completed at least two years of training in a U.S.
postgraduate clinical medical education program accredited by an organization recognized by the
Board, which he did not.

12. As part of the credentialing process for initial licensure with the Board, the
Respondent was required to have the Residency Program submit a Verification of Postgraduate
Medical Education (the “Verification Form”) to the Board. On or about April 24, 2019, the Board
received Verification Form purportedly from the Chairman of the Residency Program verifying
that the Respondent attended the Residency Program from July 1, 2009, to June 30, 2014. During
the investigation when Board staff showed the Residency Program Chairman the Verification
Form, he denied ever issuing that Verification Form and stated that the signature on the form was
a forged signature.

13. Moreover, in the Initial Application under numeral 16 entitled “Character and
Fitness Questions,” the Respondent checked “NO” to the following questions:

f. Has a hospital, related health care facility, HMO, or alternative
health care system ever denied your application, failed to renew
your privileges, including your privileges as a resident, or limited,
restricted, suspended, or revoked your privileges in any way?

n Has your employment or contractual relationship with any hospital,
other health care facility, health care provider, institution, armed
services, or the Veterans Administration ever been terminated for
disciplinary reasons?

14. The Respondent willfully failed to disclose that on or about May 26, 2011, the

Residency Program terminated his position and privileges as a resident physician at the Residency

Program due to his failure to demonstrate professionalism and adhere to ethical principles.
