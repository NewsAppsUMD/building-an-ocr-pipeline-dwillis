findings of fact, the disciplinary panel delegated to OAH the issuance of proposed conclusions of
law and a proposed sanction. See COMAR 10.32.02.04B(1).

During the relevant period, in over 200 hysterectomies, Dr. MacK oul used non-absorbable
sutures so he could perform, and charge for, a second procedure (the removal of the sutures). In
this period, overall, Dr. MacKoul used Ethibond sutures in over 500 hysterectomies. Dr. MacKoul
systemically used non-absorbable sutures resulting in an additional procedure for these patients.
His use of non-absorbable sutures was unnecessary and was not medically justified. Dr. MacKoul
argues that the “grossly” in “grossly overutilizes” can only be found in conduct that is
extraordinary or outrageous. ‘The Panel finds that his overutilization of health care services in this
case was both extraordinary and outrageous. Dr. MacKoul grossly overutilized health care
services in Patients 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9. His exception is denied.

Ill. Ligation of the Uterine Artery (the “Artery”)

As part of the hysterectomy on Patients 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9, Dr. MacKoul billed Current
Procedural Terminology (“CPT”) 37617 for ligation of the artery. The hysterectomy at issue in
this case is a retroperitoneal hysterectomy (“hysterectomy”), which means that Dr. MacKoul
gained access to the uterus through the patient’s back. In a hysterectomy, the surgeon ligates the
uterine artery at its origin, cutting off blood supply to the uterus. Providers typically bill under
one CPT code pertaining to hysterectomies (here CPT 58554). The CPT for the hysterectomies at
issue includes the ligation of the artery and the removal of the uterus. Dr. MacKoul, however, in
addition to billing under the hysterectomy code, billed the cardiac procedural code (CPT 37617
“Ligation of the Abdomen{al] Artery”). Finding of Fact 8

Dr. Rafi testified that, to safely perform a hysterectomy, ligation is essential and billing

separately for the ligation was improper.
