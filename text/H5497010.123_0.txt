Re: Katherine Asadi, D.O.
Case No.: 2223-0133
License No.: H54970

Dear Dr. Asadi and Ms. Vehar-Kenyon:

On September 27, 2023, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i).

Pursuant to the Order, on October 11, 2023, Disciplinary Panel A held a post deprivation
hearing to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. Dr. Asadi did not attend the
hearing on that date. The State was represented by Katherine Vehar-Kenyon, Assistant Attorney
General, Administrative Prosecutor. Ms. Vehar-Kenyon presented oral arguments arguing that
the summary suspension should be upheld.

After considering the State’s argument at the hearing and the documents in the
investigative file, Disciplinary Panel A determined that it would continue the summary
suspension imposed on September 27, 2023. Disciplinary Panel A thus will not lift the summary
suspension order. Disciplinary Panel A finds that the public health, safety or welfare
imperatively requires the suspension of Dr. Asadi’s license. See State Gov’t, § 10+226(c)(2)(i).
The order of summary suspension is thus reaffirmed and continues. See COMAR
10.32.02.08H(1).
