Health Oce. § “14-404(a)(3)(ii) (Supp. 2019).

Before the Board takes any action under section 14-404(a), the individual against whom
“the action is contemplated is entitled to the opportunity for a hearing before an Administrative
Law Judge (ALJ) at the OAH. Factual findings made by the ALJ shall be supported by a
preponderance of the evidence. Md, Code Ann., Health Occ, § 14-405(b)(2) (20 14).

The State, as the moving party, bears the burden to prove by a preponderance of the
evidence that the Respondent violated the statutory provisions at issue, Md. Code Ann, State
Gov't § 10-217 (2014), Mad. Code Ann., Health Oce. § 14-405(b)(2) (2014); Comm’r of Labor &
Indus. v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 344 Mad. 17, 34 (1996) (citing Bernstein v y, Real Estate Comm! n, .

221 Md, 221, 231 (1959)). As discussed below, I find that the State has met its burden with respect

tothe charges.

While the Act fails to provide any standard for or definition of the phrase “unprofessional
conduct,” the Maryland Court of Appeals defined the term to include conduct that breaches rules or
ethical codes of professional conduct or conduct unbecoming toa member in good standing in the
‘profession. Finucan v. Maryland Bd, of Physicians Quality Assurance, 380 Ma. 577,593, cert.
