2. On or about April 12, 2016, the Board received a written request from the
Administration, entitled “Request to Suspend or Deny License for Delinquent Child Support”
(the “Request”), which requested that the Board suspend the respiratory care license held by the
Respondent for delinquent child support under the authority of Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law § 10-

after sending written notice to the Respondent of the proposed suspension of his license and of
his right “to contest the identity of the individual whose license . . . is to be suspended.”

Suspension to the Respondent’s last known address registered with the Board (the same address
as that on the Request). Included with the unexecuted Order of Suspension was a letter notifying
the Respondent of his right to contest his identity, in writing to the Board, within thirty days of
the date of the letter; that is, to contest that he was not the Harr L. Marable, License No. L02620,
named by the Administration as the individual whose license should be suspended for delinquent
child support. In addition, the letter also gave Respondent written notice that if he did not submit
to the Board a signed, written appeal on or before May 26, 2016, the Board would execute this
Order of Suspension as written.’

5. The Respondent did not submit a written contest of identity to the Board by May

26, 2016, nor was the Board notified that the Respondent arranged to pay the arrears in full.

? The letter also notified the Respondent that he could prevent the suspension of his registration by contacting the
Administration and arranging to pay the arrears in full within 15 days of the date of the letter.
