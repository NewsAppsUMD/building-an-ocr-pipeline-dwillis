at issue in the Virginia case occurred in 2015. Finally, Dr. Hill notes his personal difficulties,
and how he has, nevertheless, continued to serve an underserved population.

The State, in its response, notes that the ALJ’s proposed sanction is within the
sanctioning guidelines and noted Dr. Hill’s prior violations in 2003 and 2009 related to quality
medical standards and questionable medical decision making. The State also argues that the
proposed sanction is commensurate with the Virginia Board’s sanction of an indefinite
suspension for a minimum of one year and that in reciprocal discipline cases, the disciplinary
authority typically follows the sanction imposed by the other jurisdiction, as the ALJ
recommended here. See Attorney Grievance Cmm'n of Md. v. Weiss, 389 Md. 531, 546-49
(2005). Finally, the State notes that considering Dr. Hill’s prior disciplinary history and his
dishonesty in failing to report the pending Virginia charges when he applied for licensure
renewal should militate towards a higher sanction.

The Panel has considered all the aggravating and mitigating factors and issues raised by
the parties. The Panel agrees with the ALJ that the imposition of an identical suspension as the
Virginia Board and an additional $5,000 fine is appropriate for the violations that include
fraudulently obtaining a license and making false statements to the Board by failing to report his
pending charges on his renewal application and based on his Virginia violation that concerned
patient care. The Panel, thus, adopts the ALJ’s recommended sanction.
