General Practice Deficiencies

a. Initiated opioid therapy at high dosages without a trial at lower dosages
to assess efficacy;

b. Prescribed excessively high dosages of opioids in the absence of
adequate pathology to substantiate treatment;

c. Prescribed excessive and medically unjustified opioids having
significant diversion potential, including OxyContin and oxycodone, yet
consistently failed to monitor adequately the patients’ compliance with
the prescribed regimen. The Respondent typically ordered urine drug

testing at a patient's initial visit but rarely, if at all, at subsequent visits;

? The Respondent's board certification in general surgery expired in 2014.
