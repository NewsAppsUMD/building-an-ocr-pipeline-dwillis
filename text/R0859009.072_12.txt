20. The Respondent’s personnel file from the Center is replete with
documentation of the Respondent’s clinical errors, remedial counseling, and failures to
make necessary efforts to improve his performance.

21. +A final note from the Center Supervisor, written April 8, 2021, sums up the |
Respondent’s tenure at the Center:

At this point, we are not making any progress with Sanjay. He does not know

basic cross-sectional anatomy. He cannot pick out structures like a

gallbladder or arch of the aorta. ... Sanjay had 6 dedicated weeks of training

to learn the scanner. We are now in week 8. He over scans (over radiates)

patients because he does not know anatomy. I have meet (sic) with him

multiple times to address issues. We cannot let him continue in the clinical

setting. He is not making progress and patient care is suffering.

22. Of note, the Respondent’s personnel records also show that the Respondent

himself was aware of his inadequate abilities. On self-evaluation form he was asked to

 

complete, the Respondent judged that he was only able to satisfactorily and independently

 

perform 8 out of 27 types of clinical examinations listed. He judged himself as needing
improvement in:

a. Evaluating exam order;

b. Technologist safety/IV skills;

c. Equipment warm up and QA; and

d. Most areas of post processing.

23. Sworn interviews with the Center Supervisor as well as the Respondent’s

immediate supervisor (the “Immediate Supervisor”) confirmed the personnel records’
documentation of the Respondent’s failures to meet requirements or substantially improve

during his tenure at the Center, despite their best efforts to train him.
