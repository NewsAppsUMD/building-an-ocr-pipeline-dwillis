Williams’ continued practice. Disciplinary Panel B, through its counsel, advised Dr. Williams of
this decision orally on the hearing date.

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, Dr. Williams has the right to request a full evidentiary
hearing before an Administrative Law Judge. This request will be granted if the Board receives
a written request for the hearing within ten days of the date of this letter. Any request for a
hearing should be sent to Christine Farrelly, Executive Director, at the Board’s address. If Dr.
Williams requests such a hearing, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set
the hearing to begin within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08 I, though Dr.
Williams may waive that 30-day requirement.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel B resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely yours,

   

Christine A. ena A cutive Director

Maryland State Board of Physicians
