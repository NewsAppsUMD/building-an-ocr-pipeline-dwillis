of supervised release, and a special assessment of $100. The judgment was issued on
September 30, 2019. The remaining counts were dismissed.

6. Dr. Baako did not appeal his conviction within the time prescribed by law and the
guilty plea and conviction have not been set aside.

DISCUSSION

Pursuant to COMAR 10.32.02.07E(2), Dr. Baako had the opportunity to respond to the
order to show cause, in writing, to address the following limited issues: “(a) Lack of conviction
or plea; (b) Whether the crime is one involving moral turpitude; (c) Misidentity of the respondent
with the defendant in the criminal matter, and (d) Other relevant issues, if any, other than
mitigation.” Dr. Baako argues that the crime that he pleaded guilty to, and was convicted of, 18
U.S.C. § 1542, did not involve moral turpitude, because, according to Dr, Baako, “the offense
only requires a false and not a fraudulent statement in an application for a passport.”

Under Health Occ. §14-404(b)(2), a disciplinary panel has the obligation and discretion
to determine what types of crimes are crimes involving moral turpitude for licensing and
disciplinary purposes. “[I]t is settled that whatever else [moral turpitude] may mean . . . a crime
in which an intent to defraud is an essential element is a crime involving moral turpitude. It is
also settled that the related group of offenses involving intentional dishonesty for purposes of
personal gain are crimes involving moral turpitude[.]” Attorney Grievance Comm'n of Mad. vy.
Walman, 280 Md. 453, 459-60 (1977). “[I]n the context of a licensing board’s review of the
conduct of its licensee, the concept of moral turpitude is rather broad.” Oltman v. Maryland State
Bd. Of Physicians, 162 Md. App. 457, 483 (2005).

“Determining whether an individual has been convicted of a crime involving moral
turpitude ‘necessarily begins with an examination of the criminal statute itself.” Burke v.

Maryland Bd. of Physicians, 250 Md. App. 334, 348 (2021) (quoting Walman, 280 Md. at 460)).
