Ms. Beck has had several opportunities to comply with the Board’s and Board Panel’s
orders and has failed to comply. First, Ms. Beck failed to enroll in the MPRP in violation of the
December 1, 2015 agreement. The Panel suspended Ms. Beck’s license, but gave Ms. Beck a
second chance to enroll in the MPRP and obtain treatment. Ms. Beck enrolled in the MPRP on
June 1, 2016, but within the first three months in the program, she had three positive toxicology
screens. As a result of the positive toxicology results, the MPRP discharged Ms. Beck for cause.
The Panel has given Ms. Beck repeated opportunities to comply with the terms and conditions of
her MPRP Participant Rehabilitation Agreement and advised Ms. Beck on several occasions that
non-compliance with the MPRP could result in the revocation of her license.
