professional role as Patient 1’s psychiatrist. His sexual relationship with Patient 1°s daughter, his
financial contributions to Patient 1, and his social relationship with Patient | eviscerated the
required professional boundaries.

Additionally, Dr. Johnson ignored the ethical principles of confidentiality by improperly
disclosing medical information about another patient to a woman with whom he had a sexual
relationship. As a psychiatrist, Dr. Johnson’s patients divulge to him highly sensitive
information and deeply personal thoughts and feelings. His patients may have a mental illness or
other serious psychiatric conditions that could carry a serious social stigma. The improper
disclosure of psychiatric information jeopardizes the necessity for open and honest
communication between patients and psychiatrists.

Disciplinary Panel B imposes the following sanction: Dr. Johnson’s license shall be
suspended for a minimum period of one year. Dr. Johnson shall enroll in the Maryland
Professional Rehabilitation Program and shall follow all the customary provisions for evaluation
and treatment. Dr, Johnson shall also complete two courses within a year concerning the
confidentiality of the psychiatrist-patient communications and on the proper boundaries in the
treatment of patients. Upon petition from Dr. Johnson and upon review of an evaluation by
MPRP, Panel B may terminate the suspension and impose any additional terms, if any, upon Dr.

Johnson,
