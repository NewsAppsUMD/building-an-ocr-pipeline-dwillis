stated that failure to appear or give timely notice of inability appear for the telephone prehearing
conference may result in a decision against the party. The Notice sent to Mr. Muller was
returned to OAH with the notation “Return to Sender, Not Deliverable as Addressed, Unable to
Forward.”

On September 9, 2021, at 9:30 a.m., the ALJ convened the Prehearing Conference as
scheduled. The Administrative Prosecutor appeared on behalf of the State. Mr. Muller did not
appear. The ALJ waited twenty minutes and then proceeded with the prehearing conference.
Prior to the conclusion of the prehearing conference, the ALJ attempted to reach Mr. Muller by
telephone, but there was no answer. The administrative prosecutor represented at the prehearing
conference that he had spoken with Mr. Muller after the scheduling conference, and at that time
Mr. Muller stated several times that he had no interest in proceeding further with the matter, nor
was he interested in maintaining his license. The Administrative Prosecutor represented that
during that conversation, he informed Mr. Muller that if Mr. Muller failed to appear at the
prehearing conference, a default order would likely be issued which would conclude the matter.
Both the administrative prosecutor and the ALJ called Mr. Muller on the day of the hearing, and
Mr. Muller did not answer the telephone call. The State moved for a proposed default order
against Mr. Muller.

Under OAH’s rules of procedure, “[i}f, after receiving proper notice in Regulation .05C
of this chapter, a party fails to attend or participate, either personally or through a representative,
in a prehearing conference, hearing, or other stage of a proceeding, the ALJ may proceed in that
party’s absence or may, in accordance with the hearing authority delegated by the agency, issue a

final or proposed default order against the defaulting party.” COMAR 28.02.01.23A. The
