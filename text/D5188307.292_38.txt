report or record in the practice of medicine the sanction ranges from a minimum of a reprimand
to a maximum of revocation; the fine ranges from $10,000.00 to $50,000.00, Unsurprisingly,
there is no range of sanctions or fines specified for violation of subsection 14-404(a)(43), a
flexible category that could encompass a broad array of offenses.'#

Here, the State recommends the imposition of a 30-day suspension of the Respondent’s “
license to practice in Maryland, followed by a term of two years of probation with the conditions -
that the Respondent (1) pay a fine of $15,000.00 and (2) enroll in and complete, within six
months, courses in medical record keeping and medical ethics. The Respondent, on the other
hand, advocates for a sanction that is at the bottom of, or even below, the range specified in the
Boards sanctioning guidelines and argues that suspension of his license would be an undue
hardship and that any suspension would result in the withdrawal of his board certification.

Although sanctions serve the purpose of protecting the public, by their very nature,
sanctions have a punitive aspect from the licensee’s perspective, See McDonnell, 301 Md. at
436. The applicable regulation sets out aggravating and mitigating factors to be considered;
mere amelioration of the punitive effect is not a mitigating factor for consideration. COMAR
10.32.02.09B(5), (6). Thus, even though he has tried to frame it as a matter impacting patient
care, I reject the Respondent’s argument that the punitive impact of the sanction warrants

‘mitigation.

 

18 As noted, the Board has specified the maximum and minimum sanctions and fines for violations of (14-404(a)G)
and (11) and also provided for a departure from those ranges where there are mitigating or aggravating
circumstances. COMAR 10.32,02.09A(8), (9), In light of that, there would be no reason to enlarge the sanction
based on an entirely duplicative charge for violating subsection 14-404(a)(43), without more. Imposing a separate
or additional sanction for violating subsection 14-404(a)(43) would, in this case, seem to be needlessly punitive and
duplicative and contrary to the Board’s own sanctions guidelines. See also COMAR 10.32.02.09A(6). .
