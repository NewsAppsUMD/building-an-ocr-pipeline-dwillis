License Number: D15506
MBP Case Numbers: 2006-0475 and 2013-0854

Dear Dr. Singh and Members of the Board,

Please be advised that | have decided to PERMANENTLY SURRENDER
my license to practice medicine in the State of Maryland, License Number
D15506, effective immediately. | understand that upon surrender of my license,
| may not give medical advice or treatment to any individual, with or without
compensation, and cannot prescribe medications or otherwise engage in the
practice of medicine in the State of Maryland as it is defined in the Maryland
Medical Practice Act (the “Act”), Md. Health Occ. Code Ann., §§ 14-101 ef seq.
(2005 Repl. Vol. and 2013 Supp.) and other applicable laws. In other words, as
of the effective date of this Letter of Surrender, | understand that the surrender
of my license means that | am in the same position as an unlicensed individual in
the State of Maryland.

| understand that this Letter of Surrender is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT and
on the Board’s acceptance, becomes a FINAL ORDER of the Board.

My decision to permanently surrender my license to practice medicine in
the State of Maryland has been prompted by an investigation of my license by
the Maryland Board of Physicians (the “Board”) and the Office of the Attorney
General. The investigation resulted in the Board’s issuance of disciplinary
charges against me under Board Case Numbers 2006-0475 and 2013-0854.

| have decided to permanently surrender my license to practice medicine
in the State of Maryland, in part, to avoid further prosecution of the discip'inary
charges now pending before a Disciplinary Panel of the Board and, in equal part
