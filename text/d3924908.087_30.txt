when it was not indicated.” (/d.) Dr. Drelich testified, “And the patient was tested for an
excessive number of patch tests for contact dermatitis, but there is no history to suggest contact
dermatitis.” (Tr. 244-45.) The ALJ found, “there was no patient history or presentation to
support the PT.” (ALJ’s Proposed Decision at 47.) The Respondent’s exceptions contend, “The
record does not support finding Respondent did not document need for PT. The use of Nexium
may indicate acid reflux and may therefore indicate for PT. (R-2 at 445-46).” (Exceptions at 6.)
There is, however, no documentation that Patient 7 was taking Nexium. The transcript pages the
Respondent references concern Patient 6, not Patient 7. In fairness, the ALJ also incorrectly
wrote, “The Respondent administered PT because Patient 7 took Nexium.” (ALJ’s Proposed
Decision at 16, § 80.) In any case, the Panel does not find that Patient 7 was taking Nexium. PT
was not indicated for Patient 7. Thus, in addition to billing for more patch tests than performed
for Patient 7, the PT in general was unjustified. Moreover, on two occasions the Respondent
billed for full panel SPTs on patient 7, which were unnecessary. Dr. Drelich explained, “the
patient was tested for an excessive number of food allergens which there [is] no [ ] history to
suggest it.” (Tr. 244.)

There was no indication for PT for Patient 8. Both experts for the State correctly testified
that PT was unindicated and unnecessary. Thus, in addition to billing for more patch tests than
performed for Patient 8, there was no justification for any PT.

There also was no indication for PT for Patient 9. In explaining the basis for her opinion
that the Respondent engaged in gross overutilization, Dr. Jani included, “patch testing not being
indicated, but performed.” (Tr. 92.) Thus, in addition to billing for more patch tests than

performed for Patient 9, no PT was needed. Furthermore, the Respondent twice billed for full
