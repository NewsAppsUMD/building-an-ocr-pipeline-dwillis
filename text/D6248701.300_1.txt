NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, Dr. Schnitzlein has the right to request a full evidentiary
hearing before an Administrative Law Judge at the Office of Administrative Hearings. To
receive the evidentiary hearing, Dr. Schnitzlein or his counsel must file the request for the
hearing within TEN (10) days of the date of this letter. The request for a hearing should be sent
to Christine Farrelly, Executive Director, at the Boardâ€™s address. If the hearing is timely
requested, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set the hearing to begin
within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08I, though that 30-day time period may be
waived.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel B resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely yours,

Signature On File

Christine A. Farrelly, Executive a i
Maryland State Board of Physicians
