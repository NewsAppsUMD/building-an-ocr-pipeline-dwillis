overdose, Clinicians should review PDMP data when starting opioid
therapy for chronic pain and periodically during opioid therapy for
chronic pain, ranging from every prescription to every 3 months.

drug testing before starting opioid therapy and consider urine drug

as other controlled prescription drugs and illicit drugs.
