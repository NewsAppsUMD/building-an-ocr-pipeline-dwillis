On February 8, 2013, Patient H was seen by the Respondent and diagnosed with
displacement of lumbar intervertebral disc without myelopathy as well as sciatica and insomnia.
There are no imaging studies to support a diagnosis of back pain.

During her entire course of treatment, urine screens were not ordered. On her second to
last visit, she reported that she joined Alcoholics Anonymous. When Patient H started exhibiting
aggressive behaviors, the Respondent decided that a drug screen was in order. The results of the
drug screen indicated that the Respondent was taking unprescribed Methadone and not
prescribed oxycodone. The patient was discharged as a result of these findings. Of significance,
however, is that during the course of her treatment, she did not have a urine screen to assure
compliance with medication. It was only after the Respondent noticed a personality change, did
a red flag appear. Urine screens when patients are treated with opioids for extended periods,
such as the case with Patient H, should be routine to verify compliance. The Respondent was
“astonished” to find that this stay-at-home mom had changed so dramatically and was taking
medications that were not prescribed by the Respondent. (Tr. 326). There may have been no
need to be astonished had the Respondent utilized the commonly accepted practice of urine tests
earlier in her treatment to verify compliance. Again, as in other patients previously discussed,
there is simply a lack of verification of prescription compliance that is inconsistent with
generally accepted guidelines and newsletters for the use of opioids for non-cancer pain
management patients.

Patient I

Patient I was also a patient of Dr. Hampton Jackson who treated patients for pain. He

died, and as a result, Patient I looked to the Respondent to continue his treatment. Initially, he

was not accepted into the practice but was referred to Dr. Ghorbani of the Waldorf Pain Clinic.
