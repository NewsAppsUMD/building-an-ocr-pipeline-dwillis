investigation conducted by the Board or a disciplinary panel, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-
404(a)(33).
SANCTION

Panel B adopts the sanction recommended by the ALJ to impose a reprimand; however,
the Panel is also very concerned that Dr. Williams has still not provided the patient with her
medical records and that he failed to respond to the Board’s communications, Accordingly, in lieu
of the recommended fine and 30 days for Dr. Williams to provide the documentation, Panel B will
order the suspension of Dr. Williams’s license to practice medicine until the time when the Board
receives documentation from Dr, Williams confirming that he has provided the medical records
requested by the Patient in this case.

ORDER

ORDERED that Robert P. Williams, M.D., is REPRIMANDED, and it is further

ORDERED that Dr. Williams’s license to practice medicine is SUSPENDED until the
time when the Board receives documentation that Dr. Williams has provided the Patient with the
medical records that she had requested; and it is further

ORDERED that upon the Board’s receipt of documentation that the medical records have
been provided to the patient complainant in this case, the disciplinary panel may administratively
terminate Dr. Williams’s suspension through an order of the disciplinary panel; and it is further
