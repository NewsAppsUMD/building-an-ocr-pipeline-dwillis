September 18, 2013, I issued a decision denying the Respondent’s Motion to Dismiss the
Charges.

On September 26, 2013, I conducted a hearing on the merits at the OAH. Once again, Lee
Baylin, Esquire, represented the Respondent and Victoria H. Pepper, Assistant Attorney General,
represented the State.

The contested case provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, the Board’s Rules of
Procedure and OAH’s Rules of Procedure govern procedure in this case. Md. Code Ann., State
Gov’t §§ 10-201 through 10-226 (2009 & Supp. 2013); Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR)
10.32.02; COMAR 28.02.01.

ISSUES

 

1. Did the Respondent engage in unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation of
section 14-404(a)(3(ii) of the Maryland Annotated Code’s Health Occupations Article?
2. If so, what sanction is appropriate?
