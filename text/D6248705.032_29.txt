B. Independent Evaluation Report
An independent evaluation on November 10, 2020 noted that “it was striking” that [Dr.
Schnitzlein] “was not self-critical” and “is detached in his view” of his boundary violations, which
he attributed to poor memory and an inability to understand how he was feeling. Of major concern
was Dr. Schnitzlein’s statement that he still did not have a “scenario” that explained his behavior
and had no credible understanding of what occurred and why. The evaluation report also noted a
possible injury from a prior automobile accident, and a health condition with a high risk for
recurrence. Recommendations included further workup, and weekly psychotherapy geared to
understanding the reasons for his violations.
C. MPRP Letter
In a letter dated June 10, 2021, MPRP endorsed Dr. Schnitzlein’s return to practice with
terms and conditions that included continuing participation in MPRP and an approved workplace
monitor, continuing treatment with a psychologist, clinical polygraphs every 6 months, limiting
his clinical practice to male patients, and having a chaperone if he practices in prison or
correctional facilities.
D. Administrative Prosecutor Letter
A letter from the Administrative Prosecutor on July 30, 2021 recommended denial of Dr.
Schnitzlein’s petition and continuance of his suspension. The letter summarized the various reports
from the coaching program and expressed reservations about the conclusions drawn from Dr.
Schnitzlein’s own accounts and his continued reliance on health conditions to justify his actions.
The letter also noted the lack of any appropriate further testing as recommended by the independent

evaluator and concerns that Dr. Schnitzlein’s resumption of the practice of medicine would pose
