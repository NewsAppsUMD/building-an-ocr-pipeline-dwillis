current through September 30, 2024.

2. At all times relevant hereto, the Respondent held active medical licenses in Florida,
Georgia and Alabama, and inactive licenses in North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Utah. On or about
February 22, 2023, the Alabama State Board of Medical Examiners (the “Alabama Board”) issued
an Order Temporarily Suspending License and Setting Hearing against the Respondent.

3. On or about January 23, 2023, a staff member at the Federation of State Medical
Boards (“FSMB”) sent an email to the Board reporting its discovery that the Respondent submitted
forged documents in connection with his application for privileges at a health care facility (the “FL
Facility”)? in Sarasota, Florida. Specifically, during the credentialing process, the FL Facility
contacted the residency director (the “Residency Director”) of the Respondent’s residency
program (the “Residency Program”), which the Respondent represented that he had completed the
entire three-year program, to verify his completion. In response, the Residency Director notified
the FL Facility that the Respondent had been terminated for professionalism issues after Program
Year 1.

4. After receiving the report from FSMB, the Board initiated an investigation of the
Respondent.
