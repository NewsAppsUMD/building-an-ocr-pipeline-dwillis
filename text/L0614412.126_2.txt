completely abstain from all mood-altering substances, including alcohol, unless prescribed for a
legitimate medical purpose.

On July 12, 2016, the MPRP notified the Board that Ms. Beck tested positive for alcohol
on July 5, 2016. Then, on August 1, 2016, the MPRP notified the Board that Ms. Beck tested
positive for fentanyl on July 25, 2016. The test results noted: “positive fentanyl and metabolite
at levels that are consistent with ingestion, no history of RX and denial of use to PRP on 8/1/16.”
On August 17, 2016, the MPRP notified the Board that Ms. Beck tested positive for fentanyl a
second time on August 8, 2016. Again, the test results noted: “positive fentanyl metabolite at a
level that is consistent with ingestion, no history of RX and denial of use to PRP on 8/1/16.”
Finally, on August 19, 2016, the MPRP notified the Board that the program discharged Ms. Beck
for cause based on the multiple positive toxicology screenings.

Show Cause Hearing

On September 14, 2016, Panel A issued a Notice to Show Cause, alleging a violation of
the terms and conditions of the May 18, 2016 Order and the Participant Rehabilitation
Agreement.

On December 7, 2016, Ms. Beck appeared at a show cause hearing before Panel A for the
second time. The State was represented by Administrative Prosecutor, Tracee Orlove Fruman.
Ms. Beck admitted that she did not successfully complete the MPRP program and that she tested
positive on three occasions, in violation of the Participant Rehabilitation Agreement that she
entered into with the MPRP and the May 18, 2016 Order. Ms. Beck informed the Panel that she
had recently completed an inpatient 28 day treatment program and that she planned to continue
with intensive outpatient treatment. Ms. Beck asked the Panel to continue her suspension and

give her another chance to obtain treatment through the MPRP.
