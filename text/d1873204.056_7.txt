; Ethyl Glucuronide (EtG) is a urine alcohol test to check for the presence of the Ethyl (drinking) Alcohol
metabolite, Ethyl Glucuronide. The detection period is generally up to 80 hours after ingestion.

8 Ethyl Sulfate (EtS) is a second specific metabolite or biomarker of ethanol. EtS is tested and reported in
conjunction with EtG, to confirm recent ethanol ingestion or exposure. The detection of EtG and EtS

offers greater sensitivity and accuracy for determination of recent ethanol ingestion, than by detection of
either biomarker alone.
