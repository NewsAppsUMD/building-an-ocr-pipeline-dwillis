Re: Akram A. Salihi, M.D.
Case No.: 2219-0178A
License No.: D17536

Dear Dr. Salihi and Counsel:

On July 15, 2020, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued
an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE,
pursuant to Md, Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2), concerning Akram A Salihi, M.D.’s
license to practice medicine in Maryland.

On July 29, 2020, Disciplinary Panel A held the post-deprivation hearing on the July 15,
2020 order by video-conference. Dr. Salihi appeared and was represented by Donald H. Feige,
Esquire, The State was represented by Debra Smith, Assistant Attorney General, Administrative
Prosecutor.

After consideration of the presentations of the parties, Disciplinary Panel A finds that the
public health, safety and welfare imperatively requires the summary suspension of Dr. Salihi’s
license to practice medicine. See State Gov't § 10-226(c)(2)(i). The order of summary
suspension is, thus, reaffirmed, and Dr. Salihi’s license to practice medicine in Maryland remains
summarily suspended, See COMAR 10.32.02.08H(1).
