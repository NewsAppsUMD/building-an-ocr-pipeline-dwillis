Report (the “Report”) from the Facility, which notified the Board that effective February
7, 2022, it summarily suspended the Respondent’s medical staff membership and clinical
privileges.
5. The Facility Report stated,
[o]n January 26, 2022, [the Respondent] failed to flag
and document a “critical finding” and alert the
appropriate providers in compliance with [Facility]
policy. Summary suspension of [the Respondent’s|
medical staff membership and clinical privileges was
instituted to reduce the substantial likelihood of

effective responses by [the Respondent] to
interventions, coaching, and retraining when_ prior
concerns were identified.

matter. As part of its investigation, the Board obtained the Respondent’s written response
to the allegations that were set forth in the Report; obtained the Respondent’s quality
assurance/risk management (“QA/RM”) file from the Facility; obtained pertinent medical
records; and conducted under-oath interviews of the Respondent and_ professional
