The Respondent took exception to the ALJ’s findings with respect to the Demand Letter,
arguing, inter alia, that the Demand Letter demonstrated a lack of credibility on the part of
Complainant 2. But, beyond this credibility argument, it does not seem that the Respondent took
exception to the ALJ’s findings that the Respondent engaged in unprofessional and/or immoral
conduct concerning his behavior that he subjected Complainant 2 to.

1. Complaint No. 3 —- Respondent’s Evaluation of Complainant 2’s Back

Concerning Complaint No. 3, the ALJ found that the Respondent engaged in
unprofessional and immoral conduct in the practice of medicine by commenting, while purportedly
conducting an examination concerning Complainant 2’s back pain, on how cute her underwear
was and how good she looked from his point of view. Panel B also concludes that the Respondent
engaged in unprofessional conduct and immoral conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation
of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(i) and (ii), by making these comments during the Respondent’s
purported examination of Complainant 2’s back. See Banks, 354 Md. at 62-64,

2. Complaint No. 4— Other Improper Conduct by the Respondent that he
Subjected Complainant 2 to

The ALJ found that the Respondent subjected Complainant 2 to many improper acts and
comments. The Respondent subjected Complainant 2 to a steady and long-term course of sexual
harassment. See Banks, 354 Md. at 62-64, 72, 76-77. The Panel finds that the Respondent’s
sexual harassment of Complainant 2, specifically his incessant and unwanted touching of
Complainant 2, his grabbing of Complainant 2’s hair bun and using it to jerk her head around,
telling Complainant 2 that he’d like to spank her, and his asking about Complainant 2’s sex life,
constitutes unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-
404(a)(3)(ii).
