Attorney General filed with the Board a petition to revoke Dr. Yerokun’s license to practice
medicine (the “Petition”) and a show cause order pursuant to section 14-404(b)(2) of the Maryland
Medical Practice Act. The statute provides:

(2) After completion of the appellate process if the conviction has not

been reversed or the plea set aside with respect to a crime involving moral

turpitude, a disciplinary panel shall order the revocation of a license on the

certification by the Office of the Attorney General.
Attached to the Petition were copies of the certified docket entries, criminal information, plea
agreement, the judgment, and plea agreement and sentencing hearing transcripts. Dr. Yerokun
was ordered by the Board to show cause in writing, on or before September 6, 2023, if there was
any reason why his license should not be revoked. On September 6, 2023, the Board received a
response from Dr. Yerokun presenting the argument that his license should not be revoked because
his conviction did not involve moral turpitude. Dr. Yerokun requested a limited evidentiary
hearing on whether his crime involved moral turpitude. Disciplinary Panel A declines to grant Dr.
Yerokun’s request for a hearing pursuant to COMAR 10.32.02.07E(3). Having reviewed and,
considered the entire record in this case, Panel A issues this Final Decision and Order. COMAR
10.32.02.07H(1).
