State’s expert opined that Dr. Singhal’s sexual relationship with Patient 1’s wife was immoral
and unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine. Second, she found that Dr. Singhal’s
social interactions with Patient 1 and his wife, including visiting their house to show his car was
unprofessional, but not immoral behavior. And, third, the expert found that sending the text
message about his professional problems was immoral and unprofessional.

Dr. Singhal’s expert reviewed the same incidents and found that none of the conduct rose
to the level of unprofessional or immoral conduct in the practice of medicine, in part, because
Patient 1 was no longer a patient when the sexual relationship with his wife began and when the
text messages were sent. Further, the expert concluded that, while Dr. Singhal crossed
boundaries during the visit to Patient 1’s house, none of the conduct reached the level of immoral
or unprofessional conduct.

The ALJ agreed with Dr. Singhal’s expert that the sexual relationship and social
interactions were not violations, but agreed with the State’s expert that the text message was
unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine but found that it was not immoral.

EXCEPTIONS

The State and Dr. Singhal both filed exceptions. The State argued: (1) that the ALJ erred
in finding Patient | not credible, and that the Panel should find that Dr. Singhal exploited the
psychiatrist/patient relationship to advance his own agenda; (2) that the ALJ erred in concluding
that Dr. Singhal’s behavior, especially in regards to the sexual relationship was not
unprofessional conduct; (3) that the ALJ failed to consider whether the treatment was
definitively concluded after their last session, and (4) that Board precedent supports a finding of
unprofessional conduct and a more severe sanction. The Panel agrees with the first exception,
finding, as discussed above, that Patient 1 was credible and Dr. Singhal was not. As the Panel
