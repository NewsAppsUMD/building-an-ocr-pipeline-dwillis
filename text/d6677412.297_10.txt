was not being controlled with the current medication in the pump. Dr. Williams indicated that he
wished to conduct an examination and Patient 3 consented. Dr. Williams asked Patient 3 to lower
her pants and underwear to the point where her entire buttocks was exposed. Dr. Williams
pressed up and down Patient 3’s spine and then when he got to her hips, he moved around
towards the front of her body. When he got to the front of her body, he pressed on a soft spot and
Patient 3 winced in pain. Dr. Williams stated that it was pelvic pain and began examining in
between Patient 3’s legs.

According to Patient 3, Dr. Williams started pushing up in between her legs on both sides
and then placed two fingers inside her vagina and pushed on each side. Patient 3 said to Dr.
Williams, “I don’t like where you’re at.” Dr. Williams did not stop pressing in the vaginal area or
explain to Patient 3 what he was doing or why he needed to examine that area. Dr. Williams then
concluded the examination and left the room. After Patient 3 left the office, she told her husband
and her primary care provider what had occurred and researched online whether it was
appropriate for Dr. Williams to insert his fingers into her vagina as part of an examination for
back pain. At her next appointment, she brought her husband with her and addressed her
concerns with Dr. Williams. Dr. Williams said to Patient 3’s husband, “You have a very smart
wife” and then changed the subject to other issues concerning Patient 3’s care and treatment.

Dr. Williams does not challenge any of the ALJ’s factual findings with respect to Patient
3, but rather, argues that the investigation into Patient 3’s allegations was incomplete, which
deprived him of the opportunity to demonstrate inconsistencies in Patient 3’s testimony. Dr.
Williams argued that the Board should have interviewed the individuals that Patient 3

complained to about Dr. Williams’s conduct.
