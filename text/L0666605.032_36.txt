to those measures. The Respondent is incapable of dealing with the stress of caring for seriously
ill patients and unable to accept constructive criticism with equanimity,

The overwhelming consideration is that the Respondent’s conduct at Ennead
endangered patient safety on a number of occasions. Disregarding an alarm alerting an RCP that
a patient requiring life sustaining respiratory support is in danger is a stark example of the
potential harm to patients. The risk that the Respondent’s continuation of her course of conduct
might harm a patient is an unacceptable price to pay for affording the Respondent the
opportunity to pursue her chosen career. I propose that the proper sanction is revocation of the
Respondent’s license.

PROPOSED CONCLUSION OF LAW

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact and Discussion, I conclude as a matter of law
that the Respondent violated the alleged provisions of the law. Md. Code Ann., Health Occ.

§ 14-SA-17(a)(3) & (4) (2021). As a result, I conclude that the Respondent is subject to the
dtseiptinaey sanction of license revocation for the cited violations. Id.; COMAR 10.32,02.09.
PROPOSED DISPOSITION

I PROPOSE that Charges filed by the Maryland State Board of Physicians against the

Respondent on January 13, 2021 be UPHELD; and

I PROPOSE that the Respondent be sanctioned by revocation of her license.
