Dalton acts, on occasion, with threats, intimidation, and, in one case, acted with physical force.
His prior discipline in 2010 was an insufficient deterrent to such conduct. The Panel believes
that a minimum six-month suspension is sufficient to protect the public if he is evaluated and
deemed safe to practice. The Panel, thus, is requiring that Dr. Dalton enroll in MPRP for
evaluation and treatment. The Panel will also suspend Dr. Dalton’s license for a minimum of six
months. After six months and after MPRP’s report regarding whether Dr. Dalton is safe to
practice, the Panel will assess MPRP’s recommendations and determine whether to reinstate Dr.
Dalton’s license, and if reinstated, whether to impose any reasonable conditions deemed
necessary, potentially including probation and further treatment by MPRP.
