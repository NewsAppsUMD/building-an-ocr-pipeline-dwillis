12. As part of the Board’s investigation, the Board, pursuant to Health Occ. § 14-402(a),
referred the Respondent to a Board-approved program (the “Program”) for an independent
evaluation to determine his present competency to practice medicine. On March 22, 2022,
at the direction of the Program, the Respondent submitted to an independent
evaluation. The evaluator issued a report that the Respondent’s medical condition “almost

certainly precludes his ability to independently practice medicine.”

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Based on the Findings of Fact, Panel B of the Board concludes as a matter of law
that the Respondent: Is professionally, physically, or mentally incompetent, in violation of
Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(4).

ORDER

It is, thus, by Panel B of the Board, hereby:

ORDERED that the Order for Summary Suspension, issued on May 11, 2022, and
affirmed, on May 26, 2022, is terminated as moot based upon the suspension ordered under
this Consent Order; and it is further

ORDERED that the Respondent’s license to practice medicine in Maryland is

(b) take any actions to hold himself out to the public as a current provider of
medical services;

(c) authorize, allow or condone the use of the Respondent’s name or provider
number by any health care practice or any other licensee or health care provider;

‘Tf the Respondent’s license expires during the period of suspension, the suspension and
any conditions will be tolled.
