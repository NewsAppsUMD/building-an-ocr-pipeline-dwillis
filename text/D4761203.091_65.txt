Ex. 13, at PM 3864. The State presented no evidence to call that into question. Accordingly, I
shall recommend the charge of failure to maintain the standard quality of care with regard to
Patient 3 be dismissed.
The issue of the Respondent’s accounting of Patient 3’s fibroids

When reviewing Patient 3’s records, Dr. Rafi noted discrepancies in how the Respondent
recorded the amount and weight of the fibroids he removed from Patient 3’s uterus. The
Respondent performed Patient 3’s myomectomy on October 3, 2014. In his operative note, the
Respondent noted Patient 3 had “5 or more intramural myomas and/or intramural myomas with
total weight greater than 250g.””” Bd. Ex 13, at PM 3854. In the same operative note, the
Respondent notes removal of forty-five fibroids from Patient 3. In a report completed on October
8, 2014, the Pathologist notes the Respondent removed twenty-five fibroids with an aggregate
weight of 510 grams. Id. at PM 3856. However, in a chart note dated October 22, 2014, the
Respondent notes the removal of forty-five fibroids from Patient 3. Id. at PM 3858. Ina chart
note from July 6, 2015, the Respondent notes the removal of twenty-five fibroids, consistent with
the Pathologist’s report. Jd. at PM 3864. However, ina letter to Dr. Udoff dated July 23, 2015,
the Respondent references the removal of forty plus fibroids from Patient 3. Id. at PM 3867. Dr.
Rafi testified that the responsibility for accurately documenting the size and weight of the
fibroids falls upon the Respondent. The discrepancy between the amount and weight of the
fibroids documented by the Respondent and the Pathologist is indicative of the Respondent’s
failure to maintain adequate medical records. This would be important in the case of a patient
like Patient 3 since the amount of fibroids may play a role in how her fertility treatment is

approached by fertility specialists to whom the Respondent might refer Patient 3.

I

27 1f her testimony is understood correctly, Dr, Rafi took this to mean each myoma was 250 grams or more.
