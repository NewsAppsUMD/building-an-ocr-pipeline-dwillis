Respondent’s Interview

On July 13, 2015, Board staff interviewed the Respondent under oath regarding the
allegations. The Respondent stated that his medical practice is limited to people “that I know.”
He has not maintained a medical office for at least five years. He saw patients by making “house
calls.”

The Respondent resides part-time at an age-restricted community in Silver Spring
(“Community A”) and three of the patients he has treated reside there: Patients A, B, and C.

The Respondent maintained a medical record for Patients A and B. Patient C is a family
to whom he prescribes “refills” of Zyrtec. The Respondent did not keep a medical record for
Patient C.

Patient D is a male relative of the Respondent. The Respondent acknowledged that he
had treated Patient D since receiving his medical license. He stated that Patient D had other
physicians providing care for him as well.

The Respondent stated he prescribed Ritalin, a Schedule II stimulant, to Patient D on a
regular basis. He acknowledged that he also had prescribed Tylenol #3 (when Patient D was
unable to get an appointment with an orthopedic surgeon), Ambien (a Schedule IV sleep aid),

synthroid, and Celexa.
