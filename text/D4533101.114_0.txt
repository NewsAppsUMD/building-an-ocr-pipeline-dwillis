Re: Daniel D. Dietrick, M.D.
Case No.: 2224-0048
License No.: D45331

Dear Dr. Dietrick, Mr. Marcus, and Mr. Kao:

On November 22, 2023, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i).

Pursuant to the Order, on January 10, 2024, Disciplinary Panel A held a post-deprivation
hearing to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. Dr. Dietrick and his
counsel, Mr. Marcus, attended the hearing on that date. The State was represented by Michael
Kao, Assistant Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor. Both parties presented oral
arguments at the hearing.

After considering these arguments at the hearing and the documents in the investigative
file and a document submitted by Dr. Dietrick, Disciplinary Panel A determined that it would
continue the summary suspension imposed on November 22, 2023. Disciplinary Panel A thus
will not lift the summary suspension order. Disciplinary Panel A finds that the public health,
safety. or welfare imperatively requires the suspension of Dr. Dietrick’s license. See State Gov’t,
§ 10-226(c)(2)(i). The order of summary suspension is thus reaffirmed and continues. See
