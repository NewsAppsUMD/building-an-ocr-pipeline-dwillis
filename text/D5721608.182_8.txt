Maryland appellate courts have repeatedly held that if dishonesty, fraud, or intent to deceive is
an essential element of a statute under which a defendant is convicted, the crime involves moral
turpitude as a matter of law. See Board of Physician Quality Assurance v. Felsenberg, 351 Md.
288, 295 (1998) (crimes involving fraud are crimes involving moral turpitude); Attorney
Grievance Comm'n v. Klauber, 289 Md. 446, 457-59, cert. denied, 451 U.S. 1018 (1981) (the
term “moral turpitude” connotes a fraudulent or dishonest intent); Walman, 280 Md. at 459-60;
Oltman, 162 Md. App. at 485-87.

The statutory text is clear that an intent to deceive is an essential element of passport
fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 1542, the crime that Dr. Baako pleaded guilty to. In pleading guilty, Dr.
Baako acknowledged that he knowingly and willfully made a false statement on an application
for a United States passport and that the false statement was made with the intent to secure the
issuance of a passport for his use or the use of another. And Dr. Baako deliberately made a false
application statement for a passport for himself, which is a criminal offense involving intentional
dishonesty the purpose of personal gain. Therefore, the criminal offense to which Dr. Baako was
convicted, 18 U.S. C. § 1542 (first paragraph), based on the elements of the crime alone,
involves moral turpitude.

Upon determining that a licensee has been convicted of a crime involving moral
turpitude, Health Occ. § 14-404(b)(2) requires a disciplinary panel to order the revocation of a
license after the appellate proceedings have been completed.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Panel B concludes that Dr. Baako’s conviction for passport fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 1542 (first

paragraph), is a crime involving moral turpitude. As a result, Health Occ. § 14-404(b)(2)

requires Panel B to revoke Dr. Baako’s license to practice medicine in Maryland.
