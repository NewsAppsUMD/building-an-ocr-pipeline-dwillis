Patient 1’s well-being or his anxieties when he decided to take Patient 1’s wife for a lengthy car
ride.

Dr. Singhal’s expert and the ALJ excuse this behavior by noting the prior relationship
between Dr. Singhal and Patient 1’s wife. However, this relationship compounds the
unprofessional conduct by Dr. Singhal. The prior relationship militates towards Dr. Singhal’s
duty for increased vigilance regarding patient-physician boundaries, not less. Dr. Singhal was
obligated to identify and respect potential boundary concerns with treating a friend’s spouse and
to recognize that by accepting Patient | as a patient, he was now obligated to prioritize his
professional and psychiatric role over that of his friendship with Patient 1’s wife. If Dr. Singhal
could not professionally handle treating Patient 1 primarily as a patient rather than as a conduit to
Patient 1’s wife, then he should not have agreed to treat Patient |.

As the State’s expert explained in her report, when a psychiatrist has more than one role
with a patient, the first obligation is towards the patient. The State’s expert opined that “he
should have been aware that his role with regards to [the wife] needed to change from that of a
former colleague to one where [the wife] was the spouse of his patient.” Once Dr. Singhal took
Patient 1 as a patient, Dr. Singhal owed Patient | additional duties that were not diminished due
to his prior relationship with Patient 1’s wife. The State’s expert noted that Dr. Singhal should
have restricted social contact with Patient 1’s wife and not gone to their house. The Panel
agrees. The existence of the prior relationship should have caused Dr. Singhal to be more careful
in his interactions with Patient 1’s wife. Instead, Dr. Singhal brazenly visited Patient 1’s house,
had an inappropriate conversation about a dream that he had with Patient 1’s wife, aggravated

Patient 1 who he knew had anxiety issues, and then dismissed Patient 1’s anxieties.
