It is evident from the current complaint and peer review reports that the Board’s previous
attempts at rehabilitating Dr. Alexander have been unsuccessful. Dr. Alexander has repeatedly
demonstrated his poor judgment and inattentiveness to patients during complicated procedures.
The Board has a duty to protect the public and the Panel does not have confidence in Dr.
Alexander’s ability to safely practice medicine.

The Panel concludes that the ALJ’s proposed sanction of revocation is appropriate.
