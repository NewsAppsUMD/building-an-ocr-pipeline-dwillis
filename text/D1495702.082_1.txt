FINDINGS OF FACT

Panel B adopts the ALJ’s Proposed Findings of Fact. The ALJ’s Proposed Findings of
Fact (paragraphs 1-33) are incorporated by reference into the body of this document as if set
forth in full. See attached ALJ Proposed Decision, Exhibit 1. The factual findings were proven
by a preponderance of the evidence. The Panel also adopts the ALJ’s discussion set forth on
pages 9-32 of the ALJ’s proposed decision. The findings of facts are summarized below:

Dr. Smith is an endocrinologist originally licensed to practice in Maryland in 1973. Dr.
Smith treated Family Member 1 numerous times and not only in emergency situations.
Specifically, he prescribed medication to Family Member | for allergies, outside his expertise, in
anticipation of Family Member 1’s travel. Dr. Smith treated Family Member 2 for diabetes and
hypertension which are chronic problems of long-term duration.

In 1998, Dr. Smith began to treat Patient B for hypothyroidism. Dr. Smith was informed
of Patient B’s mental health history, including post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”) and
depression and he also knew about a prior abusive relationship. Dr. Smith and Patient B began a
relationship outside the office that became sexually intimate starting in 2005 for several years
while Patient B remained a patient. Dr. Smith stopped keeping medical records for Patient B in
2005, but continued to write Patient B refill prescriptions. In 2013, Dr. Smith “thinned” the

patient file, claiming that it had become too thick.
