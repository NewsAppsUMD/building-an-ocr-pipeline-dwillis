 

He does not participate in Medicare or Medicaid, but could not remember
which insurances he accepted. When asked about how he bills patients who
do not have insurance, the Respondent stated that the patients could pay by
cash, check, or credit card, but no record was kept of cash transactions.

He does not have any patients that see him just for pain.

When he writes prescriptions to a patient for opioids, he conducts random
urine monitoring, randomly makes his patients complete a pain
questionnaire, and only writes prescriptions for a 30-day supply at a time.
He also makes the patients sign a pain contract, but he never updates their
contract.

If a new patient comes to him and has not been prescribed opioids by
another prescriber, first he tries other modalities such as non-opioid pain
medications (for example Tylenol or Tramadol) and/or physical therapy
before he prescribes the patient opioids.

After he begins prescribing opioids to patients, he verifies whether patients
are also receiving CDS from other sources by “random[ly]” checking
CRISP — typically “within two, three months.”

If he discovers that a patient is also receiving opioids from another
prescriber, tests positive for an illegal substance during a random urine drug
screen, or does not test positive for the opioid that he is prescribing the
patient, first he will warn the patient and document it, and “if it continues as

a habit, we discharge the patient.” He continues to prescribe to the patient
