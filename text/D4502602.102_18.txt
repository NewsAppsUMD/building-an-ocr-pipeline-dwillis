the Patient “a hug, like a hi or goodbye hug that was a little bit longer than customary. |
kissed her shortly as a hi and goodbye. The first year or so it was always on the cheek. And
then in 2018, ’19, it was on the lips but it was a short kiss. Anytime I would try to extend
it any longer I got the clear message from her that was not what she wanted.”

traveled internationally together to celebrate their birthdays and that he paid for the entire

And that’s the way it was.” The Respondent confirmed he and the Patient slept in the same
bed on the trip. “Well, when we were planning the trip I said we can sleep in the same room
and I promise I’m not going to touch you anymore than you want to be touched. And that
was the deal and we slept in separate parts of the bed.” The Respondent stated that while
on the international trip, “she was still taking medications that I had prescribed, yes.”
