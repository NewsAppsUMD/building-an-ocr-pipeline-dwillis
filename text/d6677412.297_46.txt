she and the Respondent agreed to delay the MRI scan to allow her intrathecal pump to empty.
Patient 3 ultimately had her MRI scan performed on February 24, 2014, (Test. Patient 3, T. at
70-71; State’s Ex. 44 at 00048, 00055.)

120. The Respondent also examined Patient 3 on February 24, 2014. (State’s Ex. 44 at
00073.) -

121. After the February 24, 2014 visit, Patient 3 had additional medical visits with the
Respondent on April 28, 2014, June 30, 2014 and September 3, 2014.5 (Test. Patient 3, T. at 75;
State’s Ex. 44 at 00147, 00170-00171, and 00199.)

122. A few months after the December 16, 2013 incident, Patient 3 spoke to her
primary caregiver, Dr. i: the way the Respondent examined her on that
date, Drltold Patient 3 that it “as between him and I [sic], and I should go back and talk

to him.” (Test. Patient 3, T. at 53.)

123. Later in 2014, after the Respondent’s termination ion Patient 3
visited a BR. specialist, iim i a She told Dr.

ow the Respondent examined her on December 16, 2013, focusing on the Respondent’s
act of touching her vagina and surrounding region. In response to Patient 3’s description of what
the Respondent did on that date, DAE scicates that he did not believe the Respondent’ s

examination techniques were appropriate, !® (Test, Patient 3, T. at 53-54.)

'S When the Respondent's counsel cross-examined Patient 3, she listed the February date as the 28th, not the 24th
and the September date as the 9th, not the 3rd when she asked Patient 3 whether she had seen the Respondent on
specific dates. Patient 3, in response to counsel’s questioning, agreed that she had seen the Respondent on all of the
dates that the Respondent’s counsel had recited. Despite Patient 3’s answer in the affirmative to two erroneous dates,
Patient 3’s medical records, found at State’s Exhibit No. 44 and Respondent No. 23, show that February 24, 2014
and September 3, 2014 are the correct dates.

16 According to Patient 3, Dr ii: specific reply was, “Well, no I don’t know you that well.” (Test. Patient 3,
T. at 54.) :
