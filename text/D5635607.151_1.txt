exists a substantial risk of serious harm to the public health, safety or welfare in Dr. Benalcazar’s
continued practice. Disciplinary Panel A thus will not lift the summary suspension order and the

summary suspension imposed on July 2, 2021, is reaffirmed and continues. See COMAR
10.32.02.08H(1).

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, Dr. Benalcazar has the right to request a full evidentiary
hearing before an Administrative Law Judge at the Office of Administrative Hearings. This
request will be granted if the Board receives a written request for the hearing within TEN (10)
days of the date of this letter. Any request for a hearing should be sent to Christine A. Farrelly,
Executive Director, at the Board’s address. If Dr. Benalcazar requests such a hearing, the
regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set the hearing to begin within 30 days of
the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08I, though Dr. Benalcazar may waive that 30-day
requirement.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel A resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely, .
Signature on File

Ellen Douglas Smith, Deputy Director
Maryland State Board of Physicians
