violation of Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. II (“Health Occ. II’) §§ 14-404(a)(1), (3), (11), and
(36), respectively. Panel B also charged Dr. Bailey with being disciplined by the New York
Board for acts that would be grounds for disciplinary action in Maryland pursuant to Health Occ.
II § 14-404(a)(21).

On August 25, 2016, Dr. Bailey entered into a Consent Order with Panel B to resolve the
charges. Panel B concluded that Dr. Bailey violated Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. II §§ 14-
404(a)(1), (3), (11), and (36) by failing to disclose her guilty pleas in 2013 for prescription fraud
in Virginia on her 2014 reinstatement application to the Maryland Board. Pursuant to the
reciprocal discipline provisions of Health Occ. II § 14-404(a)(21), Panel B also concluded that
Dr. Bailey’s revocation by the New York Board constituted discipline by the licensing board of
another state for acts that would be grounds for disciplinary action in Maryland under Health
Occ. Il §§ 14-404(a)(1), (3), (11), and (36), if committed in this state. These acts included
unprofessional conduct based on Dr. Bailey’s fraudulent answers to questions and filing of a
false report on her New York registration renewal application based on her failure to disclose

that criminal charges were pending against her in Virginia.

Requirements of the 2016 Consent Order
In the 2016 Consent Order, Dr. Bailey agreed to a reprimand and probation for a
minimum period of four (4) years with certain terms and conditions, including an ethics course
which she completed in April 2017. Condition 1 of the Consent Order also stated as follows:

Respondent shall enroll in the Maryland Professional Rehabilitation Program
(“MPRP”). Within five (5) business days, Respondent shall contact MPRP to
schedule an initial consultation for enrollment. Within fifteen (15) business days,
Respondent shall enter into a Participant Rehabilitation Agreement and
Participant Rehabilitation Plan with MPRP. The Respondent shall fully and
timely cooperate and comply with all of MPRP’s referrals, rules, and
requirements, including but not limited to, the terms and conditions of the
Participant Rehabilitation Agreement(s) and Participant Rehabilitation Plan(s)
