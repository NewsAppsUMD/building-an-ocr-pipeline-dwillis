DISPOSI

The privilege of medical licensure in Maryland involves a physician’s obligation to fulfill
conditions necessary to ensure competency to practice medicine safely. Dr. Mathur’s
non-compliance with the March 4, 2020 Consent Order and his historical pattern of
non-compliance with Board deadlines, conditions, and orders generally is of serious concern to
the Panel. Since 2012, the Board has given Dr. Mathur multiple chances to correct his
deficiencies by re-educating him on the essential components of quality medical care integral to
his practice, The Board’s objective was to enable Dr. Mathur to provide care and treatment
within appropriate standards, prevent patient harm, and enhance patient safety. Despite the
Board’s efforts, it is apparent that its previous attempts to remedy his practice were unsuccessful.
Even after multiple courses and CMEs, and years of Board monitoring, he has obviously learned
little or nothing from the Board’s remedial efforts and has shown no meaningful understanding
of or commitment to the competent practice of internal medicine.

In the March 2020 Consent Order, Dr. Mathur was given yet another opportunity to prove
to Panel A, by undergoing an assessment and educational rehabilitation, that he was competent to
practice medicine. He agreed to abide by the Consent Order but ignored deadlines and important
conditions. Equally disturbing to the Panel is Dr. Mathur’s lack of personal responsibility for his
non-compliance. His oral communications to the Panel reveal an enduring incapacity or refusal
to be accountable for failing to abide by the Panel’s directives. Considering his answers, the
Panel is not persuaded that Dr. Mathur appreciates or understands the seriousness of his
deficiencies, Given the dangerous implications for adult patient care created by the wide-ranging

deficits in Dr. Mathur’s medical knowledge and his inadequate clinical judgment and reasoning,
