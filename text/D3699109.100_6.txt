Upon receipt of the records Board staff submitted them to an independent peer
review entity for review by two physicians board-certified in obstetrics and
gynecology (the “Peer Reviewers”).

The Peer Reviewers concurred that the Respondent failed to meet the standard of
quality care in one (1) case and failed to keep adequate medical records in the other
case.

The Peer Reviewers concurred that the Respondent failed to meet the standard of
quality care in her performance of the August 16, 2018 surgery because of her
apparent unfamiliarity with the surgical instruments and non-standard surgical
techniques,

The Peer Reviewers did not concur that the Respondent failed to meet the standard
of quality care during the October 2, 2018 surgical procedure; they concurred
however that the Respondent failed to keep adequate medical records regarding the
procedure. Specifically, the Peer Reviewers agreed that the Respondent’s notes
were scant and failed to include documentation of pathology or a discharge
summary.

The Respondent’s actions, as outlined above, constitute evidence that the
Respondent failed to meet the standard of quality medical care in violation of Health
Occ. § 14-404(a)(22) and/or failed to keep adequate medical records in violation of

Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(40).
