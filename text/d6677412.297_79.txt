. For the reasons I already provided in detail, I found Patient 1°s testimony as a whole
credible. I believe the Respondent went beyond performing a lumbosacral spinal examination on
Patient 1 in November 21, 2012, when he ventured onto spreading her buttocks’ cheeks. He was
not wearing gloves. Under the definition of sexual impropriety contained. in COMAR
10.32.17.02B(2)(b)(ii), a physician commits an act of sexual impropriety with a patient when he
performs a pelvic or rectal examination without using gloves. Consequently, absent any other
evidence of sexual misconduct, the Respondent committed an act of sexual impropriety on
November 21, 2012, by simply performing an examination of Patient 1’s buttocks without
wearing gloves.

With regard to the June 14, 2013 incident, the Respondent attacks the “salacious
language” in Charge 15 referring to the Respondent separating Patient 1’s labia, moving his
hands up and down alongside Patient 1’s vagina walls, and having his knuckles touch Patient 1’s
clitoris. Patient 1 did not use any of these words when speaking to Ms. Noppinger, according to
the Respondent. In fact, she told Ms. Noppinger and repeated at the hearing, that the Respondent
only came close to her vagina that day. On cross-examination, Patient 1 asserted that she did use
the word “clitoris” when discussing the events of June 14, 2013 with Ms. Noppinger, but what
she said was probably not transcribed. The Respondent emphasized that Patient 1s interview
with Ms. Noppinger was transcribed by a court reporter, who is paid not to forget to transcribe
the words of an interviewee. .

Whether the Respondent actually touched Patient 1’s vaginal walls or clitoris on June 14,
2013 has no significance to the ultimate resolution of the charges here. The Respondent was
supposed to be performing an examination of Patient 1’s lower back. He was not supposed to be

anywhere near Patient 1’s vagina or buttocks.
