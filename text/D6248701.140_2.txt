after she was discharged, including at the hotel where the Respondent was staying.
During these encounters, according to the Patient, the Respondent and her swam in the
hotel pool, kissed in an outside whirlpool, and engaged in multiple sex acts in the
Respondent’s hotel room. The Patient also explained that as she recovered, she
“understood the gravity of [the Respondent’s] behavior.” She explained that she began to
have negative flashbacks to her encounters with the Respondent, which prompted her to
discuss with the Psychologist her relationship with the Respondent.

was discharged from the Hospital. On or about June 7, 2019, the Psychologist observed

psychiatrist while she was in the Hospital. The Psychologist confirmed and reiterated the
