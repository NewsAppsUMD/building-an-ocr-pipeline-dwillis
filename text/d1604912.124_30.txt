diagnosis or treatment of medical conditions for the members, or any other attribute of the
practice of medicine. Therefore, regardless of the ethical implications of his actions, the Board has
no basis to revoke his medical license under section 14-404(a)(3)(i).

The Respondent also argued that his actions within the Organization constitute free
association which is protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution
The Practice of Medicine

According to section 14-101 of the Health Occupations Article “practice medicine” is
defined as follows:

(0) Practice medicine. --
(1) "Practice medicine" means to engage, with or without compensation, in medical:

(i) Diagnosis;
(ii) Healing;
(iii) Treatment; or
(iv) Surgery.

(2) "Practice medicine" includes doing, undertaking, professing to do, and attempting
any of the following:

(i) Diagnosing, healing, treating, preventing, prescribing for, or removing any
physical, mental, or emotional ailment or supposed ailment of an individual:

1. By physical, mental, emotional, or other process that is exercised or
invoked by the practitioner, the patient, or both; or

2. By appliance, test, drug, operation, or treatment;
(ii) Ending of a human pregnancy; and
(iii) Performing acupuncture as provided under § 14-504 of this title.
(3) "Practice medicine" does not include:
(i) Selling any nonprescription drug or medicine;
(ii) Practicing as an optician; or

(iii) Performing a massage or other manipulation by hand, but by no other means.

 

In my September 18, 2013 Ruling on the Respondent’s Motion to Dismiss, I found that his actions within the
Organization do not constitute free association protected by the First Amendment. As the Respondent offered
nothing new regarding this position, my tuling regarding that argument stands.
