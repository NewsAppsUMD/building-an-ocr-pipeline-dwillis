Case No.: 2219-0195B
License No.: R0O2592

Dear Ms. Myers and Counsel,

On July 9, 2019, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued
an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
RADIOGRAPHY in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2). The
postdeprivation hearing was scheduled for July 17, 2019, before Panel B.

At the request of Myers, the post-deprivation hearing, scheduled for July 17, 2019, was
postponed. The hearing was rescheduled for August 28, 2019.

On August 28, 2019, Disciplinary Panel B held the post-deprivation hearing. Ms. Myers
appeared and was represented by Natasha Wesker, Esquire. The State was represented by
Christopher Anderson, Assistant Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor.

After consideration of the presentations of the parties, Disciplinary Panel B of the Board
determined that it would continue the summary suspension it imposed on July 9, 2019.
Disciplinary Panel B thus will not lift the order of summary suspension. Disciplinary Panel B
