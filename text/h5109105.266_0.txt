ORDER ON PETITION FOR TERMINATION OF SUSPENSION

On October 8, 2014, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
(“Board”) charged Respondent, Hadi M. Rassael, D.O. with engaging in immoral and
unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, based on allegations of sexual misconduct
from multiple patients and an allegation that he borrowed $180,000 in personal loans from one
patient, in violation of Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(i) and (ii). Dr. Rassael was
also charged with performing cosmetic surgical procedures in an unaccredited facility, in
violation of § 14-404(a)(41)(i) and (ii), and with violating probationary terms and conditions of a
previous Consent Order dated July 28, 2011.

On January 14, 2015, in order to resolve the charges, Dr. Rassael entered into a Consent
Order with Disciplinary Panel B in which the panel concluded that Dr. Rassael had violated
Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(i) and (ii), § 14-404(a)(41)(i) and (ii), and the probationary terms and
conditions of his July 2011 Consent Order. As a sanction, Disciplinary Panel B suspended Dr.
Rassael’s license to practice medicine in Maryland for a minimum of eighteen (18) months. Dr.
Rassael was ordered to enroll in the Maryland Professional Rehabilitation Program (“MPRP”)
while he was under suspension, and to comply with any evaluation and treatment
recommendations of the MPRP. The Consent Order also provided that Dr. Rassael would be

eligible to petition for termination of the suspension only upon full and satisfactory compliance
