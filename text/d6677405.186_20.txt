By e-mail dated June 3, 2013, Patient 7 questioned the Respondent about the
type of examination he had performed on her, stating in part: “[t]hat exam was
VERY UNCOMFORTABLE, | have NEVER had a doctor to perform that exam
and | would like to know the name of it AND the purpose.” (Emphasis in original).
The Respondent telephoned Patient 7 in response to her e-mail but did not
address Patient 7’s concerns. He simply stated that her condition may be getting
worse and that he had ordered an x-ray.

Patient 7 did not see the Respondent after she confronted him about his
examination. The Respondent, however, continued to prescribe opioids to her.
On May 4, 2016, Patient 7 was interviewed under oath by Board staff. Patient 7
stated that the Respondent had never previously examined her in that way and
“[i]t just didn’t feel right.”

During her under-oath interview, Patient 7 stated that she had not reported the
Respondent's conduct earlier because she felt “like it was just me.” Patient 7
further stated that when she heard other women had come forward, “it made me

think wow, maybe if | had said sooner then they wouldn’t have to experience it.”

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Based on the foregoing facts, Disciplinary Panel B concludes that the public

health, safety or welfare imperatively require emergency action in this case, pursuant to

Md. Code Ann., State Gov't § 10-226 (c) (2) (i) (2014 Repl. Vol.), Code Regs. Md.

10.32.02.08B.7(a).
