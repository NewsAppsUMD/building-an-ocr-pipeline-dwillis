FINDINGS OF FACT

 

The Board makes the following Findings of Fact:

1. The Respondent was originally licensed to practice medicine in the State
of Maryland on or about October 2, 1996, under License Number D51250.

2. The Respondent allowed his Maryland medical license to expire on
September 30, 2014, without applying for a renewal with the Board.

3. On or about March 31, 2015, the Board received the Reinstatement
Application from the Respondent. In response to a question in the Reinstatement
Application asking the reason the Respondent allowed his license to expire, he stated,
"Inadvertent oversight - | received a reminder notice from the Maryland medical board in
the past but did not get one this time and forgot about the deadline for renewal."

4. Based on his disclosure in the Reinstatement Application, the Board
initiated an investigation of the Respondent.

5. By letter, dated June 5, 2015, a Board investigator asked the Respondent
to provide a detailed explanation of his work activities in Maryland since October 1,
2014. In a written response, dated June 16, 2015, the Respondent stated "I continued
to practice medicine in the State of Maryland after my license expired on September 30,
2014, however, | was unaware of these circumstances until | was notified by one of my
patients in December of 2014 of my license expiration."

6. The Respondent acknowledged that he treated patients in Maryland
between October 2014 and May 2015, the time period during which his Maryland

medical license was expired.
