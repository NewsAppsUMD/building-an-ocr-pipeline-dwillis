practice of medicine. In fact, his participation in assisted suicide is antithetical to the long-
standing prevailing purpose of medical practice to treat and heal patients and/or to make patients
comfortable. However, aspects or actions the Respondent undertook as Medical Director of the
FEN do fall within the definition of the practice of medicine.

First, the Respondent does not dispute that he reviewed medical records to ensure that
patients were suffering to the extent that they would be approved for assisted suicide by the FEN.
Although the FEN had a three-member medical panel, the Respondent admitted in his April 12,
2012 interview with Board Compliance Analyst, Heather McLaughlin, that as Medical Director,
he reviewed and evaluated all of the prospective patients’ medical documents and made the
determination whether the individual was suffering sufficiently to qualify for FEN’s assistance
with suicide. Certainly, such a review of the medical documentation provided by members to
determine whether the person meets medical criteria for additional treatment is an action
physicians undertake as part of their practice of medicine.

Ihave already determined that assisted suicide does not constitute the practice of
medicine. It logically follows that if the Respondent reviewed medical documentation as a
formality — that is, if the outcome of his review of those documents always resulted in his
acceptance of the member’s request for assisted suicide, regardless of other available medical
options or treatments of the members’ underlying ailments, then I might find that the review was
inextricably linked to the Respondent’s participation in assisted suicide in furtherance of his
personal ethical involvement with FEN and I might find that his medical document review did
not constitute the practice of medicine.

However, it is clear that the Respondent sometimes reviewed patients’ medical records
and made diagnoses with an eye toward healing those patients or improving their lives rather

than approving them for FEN-assisted suicide. As the Respondent explained during his April 12,
