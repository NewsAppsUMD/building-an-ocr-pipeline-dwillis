 

efforts to fuse images causes somatic health issues such as gastrointestinal distress,
moodiness, and stiff necks.

39.  Inhis supplemental response to the Peer Reviewers’ reports, the Respondent
continued to defend his diagnostic and treatment methods, stating,

I have uncovered new symptoms associated with any small eye

misalignment, in situations where the eyes are not sufficiently misaligned to

cause double vision, but sufficiently misaligned to cause symptoms. In a

number of these patients, small amounts of prisms results (sic) in dramatic
improvements.

When the head is straight the misalignment is larger (that is precisely the

reason why the individual tilts his head to decrease the magnitude of the

misalignment). Therefore, if the head is straighter, allowing the angle of
misalignment to become larger, the individual would accept or perhaps even
welcome the prismatic compensation.

40, The Respondent consistently used a mathematical “equation” of his own
creation to determine the power of the prism he gave to the child. The Respondent’s
equation is not based on clinical measurements. Instead, the equation uses a patient’s
functional eye height, fusional effort, head tilt, and prismatic compensation. The
Respondent’s equation consists of variables that cannot be measurcd; the equation has not
been scientifically validated which calls into question its utility and appropriateness as a
diagnostic tool.

41. The Respondent consistently failed to appropriately document strabismus
using industry-accepted methods of measurements and failed to document adequately
physical findings or complaints for which prism treatment would be appropriate.

42. Both Peer Reviewers expressed concern that the Respondent drove to a

patient’s home (Patient 3) and dropped off in the family’s mailbox a pair of prism glasses
