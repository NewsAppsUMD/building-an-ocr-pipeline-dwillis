CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Panel B adopts the ALJ’s proposed default order issued pursuant to COMAR
28.02.01.23A. Panel B thus finds Dr. Nelson in default based upon her failure to
participate at the Office of Administrative Hearings for the prehearing conference
scheduled for July 17, 2017. See State Gov't § 10-210(4).

Based upon the foregoing findings of fact, Panel B concludes as a matter of law
that Dr. Nelson is guilty of: unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine by
violating Health Occ. § 1-302(a) by referring, or directing its employees of or person
under contract with Practice A to refer pathology services to Laboratory A; and
assuming any of the referrals were exempted under Health Occ. § 1-302(d), Dr. Nelson
also failed to adequately disclose her beneficial interest in Laboratory A consistent with
Health Occ. § 1-303 to those patients referred. Dr. Nelson is also guilty of
unprofessional conduct, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii), and gross
overutilization of health care services, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(19), based
on Dr. Nelson's conduct as the clinical provider and owner of Practice A, as found, in
pertinent part, in the findings of fact J] 64 through 156.

Dr. Nelson failed to provide details of patients’ medical records to her patients, in
violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(13); and failed to cooperate with a lawful
investigation by the Board or disciplinary panel, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-
404(a)(33) as outlined in pertinent part in 9] 157 through 173.
