 

independent recollection of either M.P.D. or MS.A.0. and his testimony is based on custom and
routine. He stated that he could not recall a time when Ms. EERE was not present during such an.
exam. He added anecdotally that in order to ensure that Ms. EBB is able to be present in the
exam room, she brings along a wireless phone and takes calls during the exams. (Transcript Vol
Il, pg. 44). The Respondent denied making the statements that M.P.D. and M.S.A.0. alleged,
and said he would never say such things in front of his wife.

On cross-examination, the Respondent testified that while he had che contract, he
spoke Spanish with about twenty percent of his patients, but now that the contract has been
terminated, Spanish-speaking patients make up “zero percent” of his practice. (Transcript Vol,
IL, pg. 67). He stated that he did not remember either M.P.D. or M.S.A.O., even when he saw
MPD. in person during her testimony, and therefore must rely on his medical records to provide
information about his experience with them. He stated that he is sure he did not make the
alleged comments because “it just doesn’t sound right, does not sound professional...I don’t
make those kinds of comments. I don’t even say those things to my own wife.” (Transcript Vol.
Il, pg. 45, 74). He agreed that, during his interview with Ms. Dicken, he had volunteered that he
could have said what was alleged. Specifically, he stated, “It is possible, because of the
" language, maybe I say something. 1 don’t know, maybe it was conceived a different way. Once
again, even though I have limited Spanish it can be misunderstood, ..” (Bd. Ex. 19, pg. 186). He
agreed that he might have said something that was misinterpreted or misunderstood. He also
agreed that if he had said those things intentionally, it would have constituted harassment.
