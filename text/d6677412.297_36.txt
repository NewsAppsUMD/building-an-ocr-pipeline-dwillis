60. After examining Patient 2’s anus, the Respondent returned to his computer and
began explaining to Patient 2 what her most recent Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) study
had shown. He showed an MRI image to Patient 2 and told her that there was no evidence that
she had ever broken her tailbone. He did note that the MRI image showed there was a water sac
forming around ‘one of Patient 2’s discs and noted that this water sac could have been the source
of Patient 2’s back pain. (Test. Patient 2, T. at 332.)

°61. Patient 2 also complained to the Respondent that she was experiencing foot and
ankle pain. The Respondent told Patient 2 that he could not treat those conditions, but he would
refer her to a podiatrist who would be able to do so. (Test. Patient 2, T. at 332-33.) |

62.. ° Just as Patient 2’s examination was concluding, a nurse knocked at the door of-the
examination room. The nurse communicated through the closed door to the Respondent that
another physician needed him. The Respondent told the nurse that he would be able to see that
doctor in five minutes. (Test, Patient 2, T. at 333.)

63. The Respondent never opened the door while he was speaking to the nurse. (Test.
Patient 2, T. at 333.)

64. Patient 2 sat back down on the examination table while the Respondent was
conversing with the nurse. After he spoke with the nurse, the Respondent rolled the examining
stool over closer to Patient 2 and said, “Can you come over one more time?” (Test. Patient 2, T.
at 333.)

65. The Respondent directed Patient 2 to stand again. He positioned her sideways, so
she would be looking at the side of the wall. He then positioned his legs between Patient 2's legs
and asked Patient 2 to unbutton her jeans one more time, because he wanted to “make sure of

something.” (Test. Patient 2, T. at 333.)
