guilty plea. In enacting Health Occ. § 14-404(b)(1), the Maryland General Assembly has
authorized the mandatory suspension of a license without the need for a hearing for crimes
involving moral turpitude prior to sentencing or during the pendency of any appellate
proceedings. The Court of Appeals in Felsenberg determined that “[t}he intent of the Legislature
in directing summary treatment of a charge based on the conviction of a crime involving moral
turpitude is clear.” 35] Md. at 304.

In this case, the State appropriately initiated suspension procedures under Health Occ. §
14-404(b)(1). Unlike cases charged under Health Occ. § 14-404(a), where a licensee has the
right to an evidentiary hearing and the opportunity to appear for a settlement conference, there is
no statutory or regulatory right to a hearing for cases charged under Health Occ. § 14-404(b).
Rather, the decision to grant a hearing is discretionary based on the existence of genuine issues
of material fact or law as determined by the disciplinary panel. COMAR 10.32.02.07E(3). The
Felsenberg Court explained, “when the charge rests solely upon the conviction, there is no need
to inquire into the underlying conduct” and that the question of “[w]hether the crime is one
involving moral turpitude is an issue which ordinarily may be resolved without the need for
evidence or fact-finding.” 351 Md. at 303. Dr. Yerokun’s “guilty plea served as a means of
providing for an expedited and summary disposition by the Board.” Burke, 250 Md. App. at
359. .

The determination of whether the crime, in this case, involved moral turpitude is a
question of law, which does not require an evidentiary hearing or consideration of any facts
beyond the elements of the conviction itself. Accordingly, Dr. Yerokun’s request for a hearing is

denied.
