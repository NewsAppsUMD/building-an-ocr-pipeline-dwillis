an answer to the Board sent on December 31, 2018, Mr. Nero acknowledged the additional
violation of his Rehabilitation Agreement and provided written information concerning the
circumstances.
Show Cause Hearing ~ May 8, 2019

On March 27, 2019, Panel A issued a Violation of Board Order and Notice to Show
Cause to Mr. Nero. Panel A again granted Mr, Nero the opportunity to show cause, at a hearing
with his counsel, as to why the panel should not issue further sanctions based on his violations of
the June 13, 2017 Disposition Agreement. The second show cause hearing was conducted on
May 8, 2019,
| At the hearing, Mr. Nero did not dispute the additional violations of his Rehabilitation
Agreement with MPRP and his Disposition Agreement with the Board. Mr, Nero requested that
the panel impose a Reprimand and an extension of his period of enrollment and participation in
MPRP. The State also recommended continued enrollment in and compliance with MPRP’s
recommendations and further argued that the pattern of repeated violations by Mr. Nero
warranted a suspension of his license for nine months and probation for a period of five years.

Based upon all of the reports from MPRP and the information presented at the show
cause hearings, Panel A finds that Mr. Nero failed to comply with the conditions of his June 13,
2017 Disposition Agreement and his June 26, 2017 Rehabilitation Agreement. Mr. Nero’s

violations are undisputed.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Panel A concludes that Mr. Nero violated the terms and conditions of the June 13, 2017
Disposition Agreement by failing to comply with the terms of his MPRP Participant

Rehabilitation Agreement.
