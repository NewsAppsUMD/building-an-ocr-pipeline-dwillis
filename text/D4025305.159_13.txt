In furtherance of the investigation, the Board solicited a response to the complaint
from the Respondent. In his written response, the Respondent denied that he was
impaired, but he admitted to self-prescribing non-opioid prescription medication.
He indicated that his self-prescribing was for renewals and maintenance of
medication initially prescribed by his treating physicians to address various health
issues, and was done simply for convenience.

In furtherance of the investigation, the Board obtained medical records from a
Maryland hospital (Hospital A) regarding the Respondent's hospitalization there
in April, 2017.

In furtherance of the investigation, the Board issued a subpoena to the Prescription
Drug Monitoring Program (“PDMP”). The Board also obtained and reviewed the
Respondent’s pharmacy records and prescriptions for Controlled Dangerous
Substances (“CDS”) for the period beginning on January 1, 2013 until August 24,
2018. The information obtained revealed that the Respondent was prescribing
medication including opioid and benzodiazepine CDS to himself and eight (8)

other individuals.
