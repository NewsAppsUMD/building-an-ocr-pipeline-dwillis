since he only needed to apply to renew the certification in order for it to be
active again.
EXPERT REVIEW
12. On April 3, 2019, the Board referred the complaint and all relevant materials to a
board-certified expert in pain management (the “Expert”) for a review of the
Respondent’s care. The review focused on the period subsequent to June 27, 2016. Based
on his review, the Expert stated that the Respondent committed unprofessional conduct in
the practice of medicine, is professionally incompetent in regard to his prescribing
practices, prescribes medication for illegal or illegitimate medical purposes, and
prescribes medications in such a way that poses risk or serious harm to the public health,
safety, or welfare of patients in Maryland.
13. The Expert based his opinion on the Respondent’s:
pervasive theme of prescribing high potency opioid medications without
supporting medical reasoning, without proper compliance monitoring, and
blatantly ignoring compliance issues, thus putting these patients at risk for
overdose. [The Respondent’s] behavior in combination with accepting cash
payments for medical services from patients with established medical
assistance insurance supports that [the Respondent] is aware that patients

are trying to obtain prescription opioid medications for illicit use, abuse, or
diversion.

CONCLUSION OF LAW
Based on the foregoing investigative findings, Panel B concludes that the public
health, safety or welfare imperatively require emergency action in this case, pursuant to
Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2) (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2018 Supp.), and Md.

Code Regs. 10.32.02.08(B)(7)(a).
