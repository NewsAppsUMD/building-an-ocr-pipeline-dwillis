years with terms and conditions.> He agreed to permanently cease practicing pain management
and treating patients for chronic pain. The Consent Order also required Dr. Halstead’s practice
to be supervised by a panel-approved peer supervisor, who is board-certified in internal medicine.
Dr. Halstead was required to meet with the supervisor at least once each month and to ensure that
the Board received quarterly reports from the supervisor addressing any concerns with Dr.
Halstead’s medical practice.

report, due on October 27, 2016, was submitted by Dr. Halstead late and was insufficiently
detailed. After being notified that the report was insufficient and inconsistent with the
instruction in the Consent Order, on January 20, 2017, the supervisor informed the Board that he
could no longer serve as Dr. Halstead’s supervisor. The Panel gave Dr. Halstead until February
3, 2017, to submit the name and Curriculum Vitae of a new supervisor.

Over the course of the next two months, Dr. Halstead submitted several names of
potential supervisors and individuals who were either ineligible or unwilling to serve as a
supervisor. During this time, Dr. Halstead requested and received several extensions from Panel
B.

deadline to find a new supervisor. Dr. Halstead did not provide the names of additional
supervisors by the July 1, 2017, deadline and, on August 28, 2017, Panel B issued a Violation of

Consent Order and Notice to Show Cause. On October 25, 2017, Panel B held a Show Cause
