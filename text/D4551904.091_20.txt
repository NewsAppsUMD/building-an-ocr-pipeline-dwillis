I found Ms. Dicken’s testimony credible. She referenced facts that were entirely
corroborated by the other exhibits and testimony. She did not appear to have an agenda other
than to recount the facts of her investigation. She was careful in choosing her words so as not to
misstate the facts, or recount facts not relevant to this proceeding. Through questioning, the
Respondent's s attorney attempted to establish that because the Core Client Report for both
M.P.D.-and MS.A.O. stated that each patient required an interpreter, the Respondent did not
speak Spanish sufficiently enough to intentionally communicate the alleged inappropriate
statements. Ms. Dicken explained that the Core Client Report was not necessarily specific'to the
patient’s visits with the Respondent. I conclude that it is most likely that the Core Client Report
contains general information and reflects the fact that both patients would need to communicate
in Spanish with any provider. | conclude that ‘he sent Hispanic patients to the
Respondent, including MPD. and M.S.A.0. because, based on M.P.D.’s testimony and Ms.

effectively communicating in Spanish.
