Other sexual harassment reports

Incident occurring on or about April 26, 2019

14. Facility A’s personnel file indicates that at least one other patient (“Patient
C”) reported the Respondent for sexual harassment. On or about May 14, 2019, Patient C
reported that when she presented for an x-ray of her arm on April 26, 2019, the
Respondent began engaging her in a conversation about her school, after which he told
her she was very pretty and “that his son would like a pretty girl.” The Respondent then
insistently solicited Patient C to date his son, which made her feel very uncomfortable.
Patient C stated that the Respondent insisted on showing her pictures of his son from his
cell phone. Patient C further stated that the Respondent told her he knew she was from
New York, which made her very nervous because she did not disclose this information to
him. Patient C was concerned that the Respondent was looking through her file and had
access to all of her personal information. Patient C stated that the Respondent kept her in

the room longer than necessary which made her feel uncomfortable.
