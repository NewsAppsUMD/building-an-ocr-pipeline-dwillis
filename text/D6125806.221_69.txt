fully satisfies the Board’s burden of proof on all the issues presented. Accordingly, I do not
adopt the Board’s sought-after sanction of revocation.

I have determined that the Respondent engaged in unprofessional conduct in the practice
of medicine because his January 5, 2018 text nessage was unethical by suggesting | a
former patient, that he should be happy his complaint damaged the Respondents career.

However, no evidence of a broader pattern was presented. The Respondent has no prior
disciplinary history and or. spoke well of him. In addition, I note that the Respondent’s
employer, Eo formulated a corrective action to which the Respondent agreed and
complied. Under COMAR 10.32.02.09B(5)(a), the absence of a prior disciplinary record is a
mitigating factor that may be considered in determining appropriate discipline. Likewise,
pursuant to COMAR 10.32.02.09B(5)(f), rehabilitation, the Respondent exhibits rehabilitative
potential because he agreed to and completed s corrective action.

In light of my findings, | recommend that a reprimand is appropriate. '9 Given the level of
unprofessionalism displayed by writing fl a. “[a]nd you should be happy to know that
you have successfully damaged my present and future,” I also find that a fine is appropriate and
recommend a $5,000.00 fine.”

PROPOSED CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

 

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact and Discussion, I conclude as a matter of law
that the Respondent is guilty of unprofessional conduct, but not of immoral conduct. Md. Code
Ann., Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(i) and (ii) (Supp. 2019). As a result, I conclude that the

Respondent is subject to disciplinary sanction of a reprimand for the cited violation. id.

'9 Sanctioning guidelines provide that the maximum penalty for a violation of section 404(a)(3) of the Health
Occupations Article is revocation and the minimum is a reprimand, for ethical violations that are not sexual in
nature. COMAR 10,32.02.10B,

20 Sanctioning guidelines provide a range of $5,000.00 to $50,000.00 for a fine. COMAR 10.32.02.10B(3)(c).
