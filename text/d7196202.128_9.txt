to discuss the requested and mandatory discovery, a list of witnesses to be called and
exhibits to be offered into evidence, discovery motions, stipulations or any dispositive
motions. Her only participation prior to the prehearing conference was a motion to
postpone six days prior to the prehearing conference.

Further, Dr. Nelson's request for a postponement to allow time for Mr. Smith to
be admitted in Maryland to represent Dr. Nelson fails as a valid excuse. Mr. Smith
originally sent an email to the Board seeking time to obtain temporary local admission
on February 10, 2017, over five months prior to the prehearing conference. The Panel
agrees with the ALJ’s statement that, prior to the request for postponement, Dr. Nelson
did nothing to “indicate that she seriously intends to appear and contest these charges
or participate in the hearing.” The Panel, therefore, upholds the ALu’s default judgment.

FINDINGS OF FACT

Because Panel B concludes that Dr. Nelson has defaulted, the following findings
of fact are adopted from the Allegations of Fact set forth in the May 1, 2017, Amended
Charges Under the Maryland Medical Practice Act and are deemed proven by a
preponderance of the evidence:
