Case No.: 2223-0125B
License No.: D63773

Dear Dr. Willis and Counsel:

On January 9, 2024, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued
an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE in
this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2). Dr. Willis was given an
opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing on January 24, 2024, before Disciplinary Panel B,
to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. Dr. Willis appeared at the hearing
with counsel and requested that the summary suspension be lifted. The State argued for the
continuation of the summary suspension. After consideration of the presentations from the State
and Dr. Willis, Disciplinary Panel B determined, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the
health, safety, and welfare of the public imperatively required the disciplinary panel to summarily
suspend Dr. Willis’s license and there exists a substantial risk of serious harm to the public health,
safety, and welfare in Dr. Willis’s continued practice. Disciplinary Panel B thus will not lift the
summary suspension order, and the summary suspension imposed on January 9, 2024, is
reaffirmed and continues in effect. See COMAR 10.32.02.08H(1).
