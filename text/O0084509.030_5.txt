On or about December 9, 2019, Board staff conducted an interview under oath
with the Respondent’s Supervisor. The Supervisor stated that she had been
supervising the Respondent for a couple of months before she began to receive
reports from other staff members that the Respondent had been behaving
strangely on multiple occasions. The Supervisor stated that on one occasion on
or about February 27, 2019, the Respondent “nodded off” during a staff meeting.
The Supervisor stated that the Respondent had been participating in the meeting
and talking at a fast pace and slurring her words, but moments later nodding off.
The Supervisor stated that she was not comfortable with the Respondent seeing
patients while exhibiting such behavior, so she was sent home early from work
that day.

The Supervisor stated that on March 26", 2019, she was informed by one of the
other staff members that the Respondent was slurring her words and “nodding
off at the console.” At this point the Supervisor began the process of sending the
Respondent for the FFD evaluation, with which she complied. The Respondent
was subsequently terminated and has not been to the Hospital thereafter.
