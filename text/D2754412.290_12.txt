b. She immediately told another employee, identified infra as Individual
L. She did not report the incident to senior personnel because it only
happened once.

Individual L

25. On August 25, 2020, Board investigators interviewed an administrative
employee who worked at the Practice from 2003 until 2020 (“Individual L”). In an under-

oath interview, Individual L stated:

a. She was present when the Respondent learned that Individual A was
going to file a sexual harassment claim against him and described the
incident as “very disturbing.” She saw Individual A in a panic asking
for Individual D and, shortly thereafter, she observed the Respondent
“infuriated” and looking around the office for Individual A. She later
found Individual A crouched down near a filing cabinet in her office,
crying and hyperventilating.

b. “T couldn’t believe how scared [Individual A] was and how much of
a fury [the Respondent] was like looking for her.”

c. She helped Individual A safely leave the office.

d. She recalled Individual K telling her that the Respondent had asked
her if she liked oral sex.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Based upon the foregoing Investigative Findings, Panel A of the Board concludes
that the public health, safety, or welfare imperatively requires emergency action, pursuant

to State Gov't § 10-226(c)(2) (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2019 Supp.) and. COMAR

10.32.02.08B(7).
