compromised the physician-patient relationship, the independence off. making advised health
‘decisions, and the Respondent’ s objectivity.

Clearly the Respondent did not take into consideration AMA Opinion 8.19 or 1.2.1 (Bd.
Exs. 10 and 11) regarding treatment of family members, as he freely acknowledged that he was
unaware of ihe existence of these ethical opinions until the charges were filed. He testified that
he continues to see nothing wrong with treating family members and his demeanor throughout
the hearing demonstrated a lack of concern or understanding why his actions posed possible
harm or conflicts. In fact, the Respondent testified that in his boundary course the
presenter shared that even he was guilty of boundary violations, and the Respondents takeaway
was that they were common and unavoidable. Despite that acknowledgement, the Respondent
stated that he would not have any more boundary violations in the future. This statement rang
hollow based. on the Respondent’s own testimony throughout the hearing which lacked
understanding of his wrongdoing or insight into how it impacted his family members’ care,

I find that the Respondent violated the law regarding unprofessional conduct in the

practice of medicine for providing care and treatment ii: violation of

Health Occupations Article section 14-404(a)(3)(ii); See also, AMA Opinions 8.19 and 1.2.1
(Bd. Exs, 10 and 11).
