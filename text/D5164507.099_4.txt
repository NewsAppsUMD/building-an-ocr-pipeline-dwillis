Pertaining to confidentiality, “[a] physician . . . shall safeguard patient confidences and
privacy within the constraints of the law.” Principles of Ethics § 4. Further, “[c]onfidentiality is
essential to psychiatric treatment . . . based in part on the special nature of psychiatric therapy as
well as the traditional ethical relationship between physician and patient.” Id at § 4.1.
Moreover, “[blecause of the sensitive and private nature of the information with which the
psychiatrist deals, he or she must be circumspect in the information that he or she chooses to
disclose to others about a patient. The welfare of the patient must be a continuing
consideration.” Id.

These requirements for the. protection of confidences are especially vital with respect to
psychiatric patients who share their most intimate thoughts and feelings with the understanding
and expectation that the information will remain confidential. See Salerian v. Maryland State
Ba. of Physicians, 176 Md. App. 231, 249 (2007) (holding that disclosing confidential statements
of a patient’s, psychiatric records constitutes unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine
and patients “should be ‘assured that information divulged to the psychiatrist . .. will be held in
utmost confidence.””).

In the Practice of Medicine

Unprofessional conduct is deemed “in the practice of medicine” if it is “‘sufficiently
intertwined with patient care’ to pose a threat to patients or the medical profession.” Salerian,
176 Md. App. at 253 (quoting Cornfeld v. State Board of Physicians, 174 Md. App. 456, 474
(2007)). “In the practice of medicine” should not be construed narrowly and should not be
limited to the “immediate process of diagnosing, evaluating, examining or treating a patient...
[because that] would lead to unreasonable results and render the statute inadequate to deal with

many situations which may arise.” Board of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, 354 Md. 59,
