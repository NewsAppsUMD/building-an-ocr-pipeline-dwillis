required the Respondent to wear glasses during surgical procedures and removed the
suspension on June 11, 2020.

9. On June 29, 2020, the Respondent was observed by staff of Health Care
Facility A performing a prostate needle biopsy on a patient. There are 12 pre-labeled
specimen cassettes used during the procedure. As each specimen was received from the
Respondent, staff of Health Care Facility A confirmed with the Respondent which
specimen was received. During this procedure, staff observed the Respondent forgetting
what specimens he was giving to staff. When staff confronted the Respondent about the
specimen confusion, he stated: “It doesn’t matter, just put them anywhere.” After staff
responded that it “does really matter,” the Respondent “ripped” off his gown and gloves
and said “he was done,” grabbed a patient label and walked out of the room prior to a
debriefing. Staff observed that only 10 of the 12 specimens were collected. However, the
procedure note authored by the Respondent noted 12 biopsies were taken and that two
specimens were placed in containers holding other specimens by staff.

10. On July 9, 2020, Health Care Facility A referred the Respondent to an
evaluative program. While awaiting evaluation, the Respondent was placed on
precautionary suspension by Health Care Facility A. The evaluation occurred and an
Executive Summary issued on August 19, 2020.4 On or about August 26, 2020, Health

Care Facility A reinstated the Respondent’s privileges.
