g. Regarding Patient 4, the Respondent explained that at the initial visit
with Patient 4, Patient 4 denied previous drug abuse but stated that she
had surgery and then went on Suboxone to taper off of a narcotic she
had been taking. Therefore, she gave Patient 4 “two weeks’ worth of
Klonopin,’ hoping to get a CRISP report on her.” Patient 4 then returned
several days later and said her husband had thrown all of the Klonopin
away. However, Patient 4’s husband said Patient 4 had taken all of the
Klonopin, “but she didn’t become unconscious, she seemed a little
muddled, but they didn’t bother to take her to the hospital.” The
Respondent further explained that “she wasn’t sure which of them was
lying .... But since the family didn’t seem that concerned about her
ingesting two weeks’ worth of Klonopin, I didn’t know which one was
lying, so I gave her a weeks’ worth of Klonopin.”

h. Regarding Patient 8, the Respondent explained that Patient 8 told her
that Patient 8 was getting Ativan® from the Respondent and an internist
simultaneously. At that time, the Respondent instructed Patient 8 to
obtain her medications from only one provider. After providing
Patient 8 this instruction, she believed she ensured the patient complied
with her instruction by obtaining a CRISP report “if it was after we

started using the CRISP .... [b]ut she... didn’t abuse any other drugs.
