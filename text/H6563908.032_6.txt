through the skin into an area of the body such as the arm, leg, or groin area. Additionally,

in an atherectomy, rotating blades are used to remove plaque in an artery. Risks

associated with such procedures include but are not limited to: bleeding (which can cause

bruising, swelling, and/or pain from internal bleeding, and which can require transfusion

or emergency surgery), infection, blood vessel injuries (including pseudoaneurysm,

dissection, thrombosis, and/or occlusion), and limb loss. Such conditions could acutely or

chronically worsen the patient’s circulation and could require additional procedures.

The Respondent’s performance of invasive vascular procedures in the

absence of medical justification put patients at the risk of harm or, in some instances,

resulted in the worsening of their conditions:

The Respondent performed bilateral selective renal artery
angiograms'* on Patient 4 who suffers from chronic hypertension.
Selective renal artery angiography carries risks including contrast-
induced nephropathy’ and dissection or injury to the renal artery
itself from cannulation'® of the renal artery with the angiography
catheter. Furthermore, the Respondent treated this patient with a
high dose of steroids before performing an arteriogram which can
have adverse effects on blood sugar, blood pressure, and healing.

The Respondent performed an angiogram on Patient 5 in part to
evaluate her aortic aneurysm. Aneurysms do not require invasive

angiography for diagnosis, assessment of size or leakage. Such
