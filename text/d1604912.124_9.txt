would refer the patient to a specialist, rather than use his lay, non-medical opinion. Referring
patients to specialists is also an element of what physicians do. This also indicates that in non-
psychiatric cases he was using his expertise as a physician to diagnose the patient. Dr. Egbert’s
evaluations were, thus, in the practice of medicine, even in cases that Dr. Egbert approved
without comment.

In sum, Dr. Egbert used his medical expertise to evaluate the medical records, diagnose
the patients, and measure the severity of their conditions, and he gave medical advice about
treatment, when appropriate. When he did not feel comfortable with his diagnosis or felt his
medical knowledge was insufficient, such as the psychological matters, he would refer the
patients to a specialist. The Board, thus, rejects Dr. Egbert’s claim that he did not practice
medicine.

3. Aiding Suicide Concerned Patient Well-being and is In the Practice of
Medicine.

Dr. Egbert was also acting in the practice of medicine in his role as an Exit Guide
because his conduct led to extreme threats to the patient’s well-being by aiding their suicide.
The Maryland Court of Appeals held that suicide is a type of harm to patients that may be
evidence that the physician’s conduct should be considered within the practice of medicine. See
Finucan, 380 Md. at 599 (quoting Finucan, 151 Md. App. at 417) (considering the possibility
that Dr. Finucan’s sexual relationship with a patient caused her apparent suicide attempt as

evidence that Dr. Finucan’s conduct was in the practice of medicine).
