accepted Dr. Kondrup’s interpretation, stating that the removal of the vagina mucosa was part of
the procedure to remove the Ethibond sutures. The ALJ stated that there was no evidence that Dr.
MacKoul should have billed a different code for the procedure.

Ultimately, the question is whether the Panel believes that biopsy means removal of tissue
to be evaluated or simply removal of tissue without any evaluation of the tissue. Based on the
Panel’s experience and expertise, the Panel finds that the term biopsy means removal of tissue for
purposes of evaluation, generally to determine whether the removed tissue is diseased. This is
both the common usage of the word as well as the usage by medical professionals. The Panel finds
that the incidental removal of granulated tissuc around the sutures was not properly billed under
the biopsy billing code because the tissue was not removed for evaluative purposes. Dr.
MacKoul’s billing for a biopsy that he did not perform for patients 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9 is
unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine.

Vv. Adequacy of Medical Records

Dr. MacKoul was alleged to have inadequate or inaccurate medical records regarding
Patients 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9. The ALJ found that Dr. MacKoul failed to keep adequate medical
records for only one patient, Patient 3. Dr. MacKoul took exception to the ALJ’s finding.

A. Patient 3

On October 3, 2014, in the operative note, Dr. MacKoul recorded removing forty-five
fibroids during Patient 3’s first surgery and “close to 1 Kg of fibroids.” However, concerning
Patient 3’s first surgery, the pathologist recorded, on October 8, 2014, that Dr. MacKoul removed
twenty-five fibroids, which weighed 510 grams. Dr. MacKoul subsequently noted in a medical
chart, on October 22, 2014, that he removed forty-five fibroids. But, in a note dated July 6, 2015,

Dr. MacKoul recorded removing twenty-five fibroids. But then, in a letter, dated July 23, 2015,
