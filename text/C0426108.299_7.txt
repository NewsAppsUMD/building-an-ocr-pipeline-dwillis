 

full first and last names. Second, and more significantly, the initial “A.” in this document is
identical to other documents in the record that contain only Mr. Gbadamosi’s initials “A.G.” For
example, the hospital’s “Consent, Release & Verification Form” was initialed by Mr. Gbadamosi
on August 2, 2015, and the initial “A.” on that form js identical to the initial “A.” on the January
4, 2017 Report. Another hospital form entitled “Statement of Applicant and Release of
Information” was also initialed multiple times by Mr. Gbadamosi on September 13, 2016, and
the initial “A.” is identical to the initial “A.” on the January 4, 2017 Report. Mr, Gbadamosi’s
exception to Finding of Fact 21 is denied.

In Finding of Fact 25, the ALJ found that Mr. Gbadamosi’s “NO” answer to Question II.o
of his 2017 Renewal Application was false because he did not disclose his resignation in lieu of
termination from the hospital. That question asked whether the applicant had voluntarily
resigned or terminated a contract from any hospital while under investigation for disciplinary
reasons. On the 2017 Renewal Application, Mr. Gbadamosi further affirmed that the information
he provided was true and correct.

In his exceptions, Mr. Gbadamosi contends that the ALJ’s analysis regarding signatures
and irregularities on the hospital documents contradicts her conclusions. The employment
records from the hospital, however, consistently indicate that Mr, Gbadamosi resigned from his
position in lieu of termination. As a reason for his separation of employment, his personnel
action form stated that he “resign[ed] in lieu of discharge”, and the “Maryland Unemployment
Insurance Request for Separation Information” form confirmed that Mr. Gbadamosi “quit in lieu
of discharge,” with comments indicating “numerous patient and safety complaints.” Emails
between hospital staff also confirmed that Mr. Gbadamosi “resigned before they could terminate
