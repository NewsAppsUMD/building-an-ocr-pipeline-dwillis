ORDER AFTER SHOW CAUSE HEARING

On June 13, 2022, Disciplinary Panel B (“Panel B”) of the Maryland State Board of
Physicians (“Board”) and Krista Chastain, Radiographer, entered into a consent order that, among
other things, required Ms. Chastain to enroll in the Maryland Professional Rehabilitation Program
(“MPRP”) and comply with all therapy, treatment, evaluations, and screenings as directed by
MPRP. On November 23, 2022, Panel B issued a Violation of Consent Order and Notice to Show
Cause because Ms. Chastain was discharged from MPRP for cause due to non-adherence with the
rehabilitation agreement. On January 25, 2023, Panel B held a show cause hearing where Ms.
Chastain had the opportunity to argue why her license should not be subject to further discipline.
Ms. Chastain appeared on her own behalf and the State was represented by the Administrative
Prosecutor.
