 

contacted (IP management staff. It was after reporting the Respondent’s actions that the
Respondent contacted Patient A again, aggressively trying to obtain information from him while
at the same tire pressuring Patient A to encourage his wife to make a misrepresentation to
GRP esse! in an attempt to cover-up his misdeed. Both Patient A and his wife have had -
to spend much time and energy as they have participated, as requested by | the State,
in this disciplinary process.

It is apparent that all through the process, the Respondent has made false statements and
provided inconsistent information oi and the Board, in attempts to hide his conduct in
accessing confidential medical records without authorization and in having inappropriate
conversations with Patient A. The Respondent has clearly chosen the path of denying the
allegations, in the face of strong evidence, repeating the denials and digging in his heels, even as
inconsistencies and logical flaws in his position were brought to his attention. He has, for the
most part, decided “to stonewall it,” that is, to remain steadfast in his denials throughout the
process, with the one exception of acknowledging now that he may have accessed Patient A’s .
record. This is not a situation where a wrongdoer has acknowledged the error of his ways and
shown remorse.

The Respondent asserted a defense, yet he did not offer the testimony of Dg or . -
anyone else to corroborate his bald assertion that he was justified in accessing the records of
those patients other than Patient A. The only patient whose record the Respondent may have had
a legitimate purpose in accessing was that of Patient B, who was a private patient of his at some
point. : .

As a physician who acknowledged in vriting SD policy regarding patient privacy
on at least two occasions during his career there, he knew of the confidentiality requirements

regarding hospital patients, including those with whom he had no physician/patient relationship.
