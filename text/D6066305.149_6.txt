IV. PROPOSED DEFAULT ORDER, OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE
HEARINGS, MAY 15, 2018

17. The Board referred the Charges to the Office of Administrative Hearings
(“OAH”) for adjudication. On April 13, 2018, the OAH issued written notice to the parties
that it would convene a scheduling conference on May 4, 2018. OAH sent the notices to
the State, the Respondent and his attorney of record at their addresses of record.

18. On May 4, 2018, an administrative law judge (“ALJ”) with the OAH convened
the scheduling conference. A representative of the State appeared. Neither the
Respondent nor his attorney of record appeared. The OAH found that it had provided
proper service to the Respondent and issued a Proposed Default Order, dated May 15,
2018. Pursuant to the Proposed Default Order, the ALJ proposed that: the Respondent
be held in default; the Board accept as fact the statements set forth in the Allegations of
Fact section of the Charges; the Board conclude as a matter of law that the Respondent
violated the Act under Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(1), (3)(ii) and (36) in the manner set forth
in the Charges; and the Board impose any disciplinary action against the Respondent that
it finds appropriate.

19. In a written filing dated May 31, 2018, the Respondent took Exception to the
Proposed Default Order. In a written filing dated June 8, 2018, the State responded to the

Respondent’s Exceptions.
