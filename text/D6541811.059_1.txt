On April 22, 2019, the ALJ issued a proposed decision concluding that Dr. Ojiegbe
engaged in unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine; failed to meet appropriate
standards for the delivery of quality medical care; failed to comply with the provisions of the
Maryland Pharmacy Act, Health Occupations Article § 12-102; and failed to keep adequate
medical records. See Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii), (22), (28), and (40). The ALJ also found
that Dr. Ojiegbe failed to comply with a condition of the March 12, 2015 Consent Order by
failing to comply with the provisions of the Act. The ALJ determined that Dr. Ojiegbe did not
willfully make or file a false report or record in the practice of medicine or willfully make a false
representation when seeking or making application for licensure or any other application related
to the practice of medicine. See Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(11) and (36).

The ALJ proposed a sanction of a six-month suspension followed by a period of
probation with conditions to be decided by the disciplinary panel should the suspension be
terminated, The ALJ also recommended that Dr. Ojiegbe be permanently prohibited from
dispensing medications out of his office and that he be required to undergo an evaluation by the
Center for Personalized Education for Professionals to determine whether he can safely return to
the practice of medicine.

Dr. Ojiegbe filed exceptions to the ALJ’s proposed decision, and the State filed a
response. On September 11, 2019, both parties appeared before Board Disciplinary Panel A
(“Panel A” or the “Panel”) for an oral exceptions hearing.
