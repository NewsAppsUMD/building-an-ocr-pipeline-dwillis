36. Patient 7, who lives in Baltimore, Maryland, has a history of prosecutions for
possession of CDS from 2010 through 2012.

37. Many of the patients had insurance that could have covered their medical treatment
but decided to pay cash to obtain prescriptions from the Respondent instead of using their
insurance, perhaps elsewhere, for the treatment they purportedly sought.

walls that he was currently board-certified in internal medicine, and the Respondent’s prescription
pads also stated that he was board-certified in internal medicine. Likewise, the Respondent’s
letterhead represented that he was board-certified in internal medicine. Further, the Respondent

was not board-certified in internal medicine.
