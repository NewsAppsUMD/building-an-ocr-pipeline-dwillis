Respondent. Nurse A then noticed a syringe sticking out of the Respondent’s left sock
which was attached to tubing and an angiocath in the Respondent’s foot.

used to inject the Versed that Nurse A had just “wasted” with the Respondent. The

syringe and confirmed that the substance was a cloudy white substance that is indicative of
Propofol.

the Facility for an evaluation.

hydrochloride jelly.
