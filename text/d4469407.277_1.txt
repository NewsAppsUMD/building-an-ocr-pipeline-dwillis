B there exists a substantial risk of serious harm to the public health, safety or welfare in your
continued practice. Disciplinary Panel B, through its counsel, advised you of this decision orally
on the hearing date.

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, you have the right to request a full evidentiary hearing
before an Administrative Law Judge. This request will be granted if the Board receives a written
request for the hearing within TEN (10) days of the date of this letter. Any request for a hearing
should be sent to Christine Farrelly, Executive Director, at the Boardâ€™s address. If such a hearing
is requested, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set the hearing to begin
within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08 I, though that 30-day requirement may
be waived.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel B resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely yours,
