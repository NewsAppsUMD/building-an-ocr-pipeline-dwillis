Board’s orders, I do not find any significant mitigating factor that makes the Respondent’s
failure to comply with the Consent Order in any way excusable. I recommend a revocation of
the Respondent’s license to practice medicine.
PROPOSED CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Based on the Proposed Findings of Fact and Discussion, J conclude as a matter of law
that the Respondent is guilty of unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine as a result of
violating the terms of a November 5, 2015 Consent Order by failing to permanently close his
medical practice in May 2017. Md. Code Ann., Health Occ., § 14-404(a)(3)(ii) (Supp. 2018).

I further conclude as a matter of law that a revocation of the Respondent’s license to
practice medicirie constitutes a reasonable and appropriate sanction. Md. Code Ann., Health
Occ., § 14-404(a) (Supp. 2018).

PROPOSED DISPOSITION

 

I PROPOSE that the Maryland State Board of Physicians’ October 26, 2017 charges
against the Respondent be UPHELD.

I further PROPOSE that the Respondent’s license to practice medicine be revoked.
