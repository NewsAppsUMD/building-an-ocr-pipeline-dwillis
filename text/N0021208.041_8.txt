In his written response to the complaint that he inappropriately touched

Patient [’s breast during the bone scan procedure, the Respondent wrote in pertinent part:

In order to calm [Patient 1] down I told her that she has overcome
treatment despite her condition. That she does not have a dangerous
form of ductal carcinoma. She said “where, what’?

At this point I stated that it occurs around the neeple (sic). She tried
to show (sic) left side which had surgery. In order to show (sic) |

helped her right breast (sic) and show area where it usually happens.

The Respondent’s written response is inconsistent with the statements he

made during the Hospital investigation during which it was reported that the Respondent

admitted that he used his hand to lift Patient 1’s breast and circled her nipple with his finger

for a few seconds to show her where ductal carcinoma would have occurred. The

Respondent did not ask Patient 1 for permission before touching her naked breast."

During his under-oath interview with Board staff, the Respondent stated:

She was nervous, so I helped her remove the right strap [of her
camisole] and showed her that, you know, with my gloved
hands, that particularly ductal carcinoma happens around the
nipple area.

The Respondent further stated that he “may” have touched Patient 1’s breast

during the course of trying to show Patient 1 where ductal carcinoma could occur but could

not recall.

1A chaperone was not present in the room where Patient 1°s bone sean was performed. The procedure does
not require a patient to disrobe.
