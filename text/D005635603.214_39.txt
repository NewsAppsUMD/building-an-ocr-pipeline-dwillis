certainly left the impression that any complaints against the Respondent would not result in

Complainant 2 felt there would have been a “target on [her] back” if she made these complaints

Individual 3 testified that the Hospital personnel were afraid to report him, because they felt he

engaged in this type of conduct again against someone who was not conscious and there was no

was issued due to his astonishing lack of sound judgment, his utter lack of boundaries, the
