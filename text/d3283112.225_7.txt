prescribed opioid and non-opioid medications, including OxyContin 40 mg TID; Soma
350 mg QHS (taken at bedtime); Xanax 1 mg TID; and Medrol dosepak.

28. On June 4, 2013, the Respondent ordered UDS that was positive for
opioids but negative for Soma or Xanax, both of which the Respondent prescribed on
the prior visit, May 4, 2013. The Respondent did address these inconsistent findings
such as considering decreasing the amount prescribed.

29. On June 20, 2013, the Respondent mailed Patient B prescriptions for
oxycodone 15 mg, TID, and Soma.

30. On July 12, 2013, the Respondent noted that Patient B's UDS was
"unremarkable." The Respondent began prescribing OxyContin 40 mg, TID on this
date.

31. On August 9, 2013, the Respondent began prescribing clonazepam, a
benzodiazepine, in addition to OxyContin 40 mg, TID (100 tablets).

32. On September 9, 2013, the Respondent ordered UDS that was positive for
cocaine, and for buprenorphine, which the Respondent did not prescribe. The UDS did
not reveal the presence of Soma for a second time.

33. In a note dated October 14, 2013, the Respondent stated, "repeat such
irregularities may be grounds for dismissal from care." Despite this warning, the
Respondent continued to prescribe opioids without alteration or change, and without
employing other modalities to address this finding.

34. On November 11, 2013, the Respondent suggested that Patient B

undergo formal detoxification.
