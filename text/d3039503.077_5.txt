On June 6, 1995, the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) placed restrictions on
the Respondent’s Certificate of Registration for a period of two years requiring that he not
dispense or administer any CDS except in a hospital setting, that he use triplicate forms for all
CDS prescriptions, maintain one copy at his registered location and another to be received by
DEA and that he consent to inspections. The basis of the DEA restriction included findings that
the Respondent had prescribed CDS to patients without conducting examinations, and that he did
not keep medical records on patients he treated.

On October 25, 1995, the BPQA terminated the Respondent’s probation based on his
compliance with the terms and conditions of the June 2, 1992, Consent Order.

On November 19, 2008, the Board issued an Advisory Letter to the Respondent after
receiving information from law enforcement that he had engaged in questionable CDS
prescribing practices including seeing patients in an inappropriate office setting. During the
Board’s interview of the Respondent, the Respondent acknowledged writing prescriptions for
family members and a friend, but he did not maintain a medical record on these individuals. The
Board closed the case but advised the Respondent to maintain adequate records on all patients.

The Respondent’s license was scheduled to expire on September 30, 2017.

At all times relevant, the Respondent did not maintain a medical office and did not hold
hospital privileges. He made house calls to approximately four patients.

On January 15, 2015, the Board reviewed a complaint from the Medical Director of
Hospital A’s Emergency Room (the “Complainant”) alleging the Respondent had represented
that he was the roommate/fiancée of a female patient (“Patient A”) who had been admitted to
