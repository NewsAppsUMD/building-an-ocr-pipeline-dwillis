Re: Permanent Surrender of License to Practice Respiratory Care
Sheila V. Williams, RCP; License Number: L01472
Case Number: 2220-0059A

Dear Dr. Bhandari and Members of Disciplinary Panel A:

Please be advised that, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. (“Health Occ.”)
§14-SA-16, (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2019 Supp.), I have decided to permanently
SURRENDER my license to practice respiratory care in the State of Maryland, License
Number L01472, effective immediately. I understand that upon surrender of my license, I
may not provide respiratory care services or treatment to any individual, with or without
compensation, and cannot otherwise engage in the practice of respiratory care in the State
of Maryland as it is defined in the Maryland Respiratory Care Practitioners Act (the
“Act”), Health Occ. §§ 14-5A-01 ef seg. and other applicable laws. In other words, as of
the effective date of this permanent Letter of Surrender, I understand that the surrender of
my license means that I am in the same position as an unlicensed individual in the State
of Maryland.

I understand that this Letter of Surrender is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT, and upon
Disciplinary Panel A’s (“Panel A”) acceptance, becomes a FINAL ORDER of Panel A
of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”),

I acknowledge that the Board initiated an investigation of my practice and on
January 13, 2020, Panel A issued disciplinary charges against me under Health Occ. §
14-5A-17(a)(1) (Fraudulently or deceptively obtains or attempts to obtain a license for
the applicant, licensee, or for another); §14-5A-17(a)(3) (Is guilty of unprofessional or
immoral conduct in the practice of respiratory care); §14-5A-17(a)(10) (Willfully makes
or files a false report or record in the practice of respiratory care), Specifically, Panel A
alleged that: (1) I provided false information on my original Maryland application for
licensure as a respiratory care practitioner on March 23, 1992, by stating that I had never
pled guilty to any criminal charge, or been convicted of a crime, when I pleaded guilty to
murder in the 2" degree on March 14, 1982 in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, and
(2) between 1992 and 2018, I failed to provide a true and accurate response on
subsequent and numerous license renewal application questions which asked whether I
had ever pled guilty to any criminal charge, or been convicted of a crime. A copy of the
charges is attached as Attachment 1.
