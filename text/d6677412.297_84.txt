an e-mail to her primary care physician, Dr. Be: the complaints that she made in her
e-mail to Dr. as that the Respondent sexually abused her. This communication

Patient 2 testified that after the Respondent essentially violated her sexually by

examining her anus for no medically-valid reason on August 18, 2014, she began ‘having

her anus. She woke up screaming, having what she first perceived as convulsions. A neurologist
diagnosed her with having night terrors. She also reports that she developed a body rash that she
did not have’ before her encounter with the Respondent. Patient 2 noted that she had been

sexually abused when she was a child growing up in Costa Rica. Patient 2 indicated that the
August 18, 2014 incident involving the Respondent brought back bad memories of that prior
incident of sexual abuse, (Test. Patient 2, T. at 355-57.)

The Respondent suggests that Patient 2 had ulterior motives for accusing him of sexually
abusing her on August 18, 2014. He notes that Patient 2 admitted on cross-examination that she
is pursuing a disability claim. (Test. Patient 2, T. at 360.) Although Patient 2 indicated that she is .
seeking eligibility for disability payments based on cervical spondylosis, she has been seeing a

that Patient 2 only started accusing him of sexual abuse when her e-mail requests SC
medical providers for answers to her questions went unanswered. It was only at this point, when

her expectations were unmet, that Patient 2 “lashed out.” (T. at 1442.)
