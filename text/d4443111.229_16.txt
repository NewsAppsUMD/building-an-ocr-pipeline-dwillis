the patient and of the Respondent, to which the indicators for anaphylaxis offer little insight.
Therefore, the Panel will not adopt the ALJ's finding of fact 8, as it provides little value to the
discussion. Along these lines, the Respondent took exception to the ALJ's summary of his expert
witness's testimony, arguing that it ignored the expert's testimony indicating that a rapid
examination was justified in this case. The Panel does not find that an urgent examination was
unjustified. But as already stated, the urgency of the examination offers little insight as to whether
the Respondent groped Patient A's breasts.

Did the Respondent Concede that Patient A Felt Uncomfortable With Examination?

The Respondent took exception to the ALJ's finding that the Respondent conceded that
Patient A felt uncomfortable with the examination. The Panel cannot locate in the record where
the Respondent stated this. The Panel grants this exception and thus finds that the Respondent did
not concede that Patient A felt uncomfortable with the examination,

Did the Respondent Touch Patient A's Nipples?

The Respondent took exception to the ALJ's finding that the Respondent touched Patient
A's nipples. According to the Respondent, Patient A did not specify in her testimony at OAH that
Patient A touched her nipples. Patient A, however, specifically stated during her interview with
the police detective and in her interview with the Board investigators that the Respondent touched
her nipples, and there was nothing in her testimony before the ALJ to suggest that he did not. This
exception is denied,

In sum, the Respondent's actions, with respect his interactions with Patient A, on October
29, 2015, constitute immoral and unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation
of Health Occ. ยง 14-404(a)(3)(i) and (ii), and sexual misconduct, see COMAR

10.32.17.02B(4)(a),(b)(v) (sexual violation); COMAR 10.32.17.03.
