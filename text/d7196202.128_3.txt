notified the parties of the time and date of the July 17, 2017, In-Person Prehearing
Conference.

On July 11, 2017, Dr. Nelson filed a request to postpone the prehearing
conference, claiming that she had not been able to retain counsel due to financial
hardship. Dr. Nelson stated that she was working in Abu Dhabi and requested a
postponement until September 2017.

On July 12, 2017, the State filed an objection to Dr. Nelson’s postponement
request and argued that: the Board gave Dr. Nelson repeated opportunities to respond
to the charges and retain counsel; Dr. Nelson failed to file a timely prehearing
statement; Dr. Nelson had sufficient time to retain counsel; Dr. Nelson failed to respond
to the State’s May 18 discovery request; and that the charges are serious and involve
patient care.

The ALJ denied the postponement request, and the OAH Docket Specialist
notified Dr. Nelson by telephone that her request had been denied.

On July 17, 2017, Ms. Rubin appeared for the State at the prehearing
conference. Saul Jablon, Esquire, appeared for Dr. Nelson for the limited purpose of
requesting a postponement. Mr. Jablon stated that he was contacted by Mr. Smith, the
Georgia-licensed attorney, on July 13 or 14, 2017, and indicated that Mr. Smith was
planning to represent Dr. Nelson pro bono. Mr. Jablon stated that he agreed to
represent Dr. Nelson at OAH on July 17, and requested an extension of time for Mr.

Smith to be admitted Pro Hac Vice.
