asked the ALJ to allow the evidence because his poor health, at the time, prevented him from
complying. The ALJ acknowledged Dr. Dooley’s health condition, but recognized that he was
“precluded from taking that factor into consideration in determining whether certain proposed
exhibits should be excluded from the evidence in this case.” The ALJ determined that the
exclusion of any exhibits described in the regulation was mandatory, pursuant to COMAR
10.32.02.04C(2)(d). Accordingly, the ALJ granted the State’s motion, in part, and excluded
paragraphs 17 to 122 of Exhibit 1 and Exhibits 2 through 11, to the extent they were different
from the medical records and exhibits produced by the State.

Dr. Dooley takes exception to the ALJ’s decision to exclude paragraphs 17 to 1227 of his
Exhibit 1 and his Exhibits 2 through 11.° Dr. Dooley argues that the ALJ abused his discretion
by applying COMAR 10.32.02.04C(2) in an overbroad manner, and further, argues that the ALJ
should have admitted the exhibits and redacted any statements within the scope of COMAR
10.32.02.04C(2), rather than excluding the exhibits as a whole.

The ALJ correctly determined that COMAR 10.32.02.04C is mandatory and that any
evidence within the scope of the regulation must be excluded if proper notice was not provided
within 45 days of the issuance of charges. Based on COMAR 10.32.02.04C, the ALJ excluded
the exhibits outright and did not exercise discretion under State Gov’t § 10-213(d) to exclude any
“{ncompetent, irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious” evidence in Dr. Dooley’s additional
exhibits. Both parties acknowledge, however, that Dr. Dooley’s Exhibits 2-11 contained the
same medical records for Patients A-J that were produced by the State and admitted into

evidence by the ALJ. Thus, the ALJ mistakenly concluded that all of Dr. Dooley’s exhibits fell

7 The ALI’s proposed decision states that he excluded paragraphs 17 to 22 of Dr. Dooley’s Exhibit 1. Both parties,
however, agree that this was a typographical error and that the ALJ, in actuality, excluded paragraphs 17-122.

® The exhibits excluded by the ALJ were attached as an appendix to Dr. Dooley’s exceptions.
