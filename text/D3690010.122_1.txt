Panel B, including the instances described below, Panel B has reason to believe that the
following facts are true’:

Introduction

1. Panel B is summarily suspending the Respondent’s license to practice
medicine based on an evaluation that was ordered after Panel B issued a Final Decision
and Order, dated February 24, 2022, wherein Panel B found that he engaged in sexual
boundary violations with female subordinates. The evaluation determined that the
Respondent had little insight into his boundary violations and continued to be at risk for
' repeating the same unprofessional behaviors. Thus, the evaluators did not endorse the
Respondent to practice medicine and recommended that he attend an in-patient treatment
program. The Respondent failed to comply with the directives of the Maryland
Professional Rehabilitation Program (“MPRP”), in violation of the February 24, 2022
Final Decision and Order.
