lil. © CURRENT INVESTIGATIVE FINDINGS

11. In or around April 2017, the Board initiated an investigation of the
Respondent under Board Case Number 2217-0049A after receiving information from
the Arlington County, Virginia, Police Department that on two dates (January 24 and
March 9, 2017), the Respondent had overdosed on controlled dangerous substances
(“CDS”) and experienced seizures. The Respondent was hospitalized in both incidents.

12. In the first incident, on January 24, 2017, emergency services responded
to the Respondent's residence after receiving a report that he had overdosed and was
having a seizure. After the Respondent regained consciousness, he stated that he had
taken and overdosed on Tramadol 25 mg samples (Tramadol is an opioid and Schedule
IV CDS).

13. In the second incident, on March 9, 2017, emergency services personnel
responded to the Respondent's residence to treat the Respondent, who had again
overdosed on CDS. After the Respondent was hospitalized, he stated to police that he
had intravenously injected and overdosed on cocaine, and that he had misrepresented
that he had taken Tramadol.

14. By letter dated June 16, 2017, the Board requested that the Respondent
provide a response to allegations that he was hospitalized after overdosing on a CDS.

15. By letter dated July 7, 2017, the Respondent provided a written response
to the Board in which he admitted to an “addiction” and that he “overdosed, and needed
medical attention, on January 24 and March 9, 2017.” The Respondent stated that after
the March 9, 2017, overdose and hospitalization, he underwent in-patient treatment and
is currently under the supervision of the Medical Society of the District of Columbia’s

Physician Health Program (“MSDC-HP’”).
