CONSENT

I, Rowena Tan Grumbine, M.D., acknowledge that I have consulted with counsel
before signing Consent Order II.

By this Consent, I agree to be bound by Consent Order II and all its terms and
conditions and understand that the disciplinary panel will not entertain any request for
amendments or modifications to any condition.

T assert that I am aware of my right to a formal evidentiary hearing, pursuant to Md.
Code Ann., Health Occ. § 14-405, and Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t §§ 10-201 ef seq.
concerning the charges. I waive this right and elect to sign Consent Order II instead.

I acknowledge the validity and enforceability of Consent Order II as if entered after
the conclusion of a formal evidentiary hearing in which I would have had the right to
counsel, to confront witnesses, to give testimony, to call witnesses on my behalf, and to all
other substantive and procedural protections as provided by law. I waive those procedural
and substantive protections. I acknowledge the legal authority and the jurisdiction of the
disciplinary panel to initiate these proceedings and to issue and enforce Consent Order II.
I voluntarily enter into, and agree to comply, with the terms and conditions set forth in
Consent Order II as a resolution of the charges. I waive any right to contest the Findings
of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Order set out in Consent Order II. I waive all rights to
appeal Consent Order II.

I sign Consent Order II, without reservation, and fully understand its language and
the meaning of its terms and conditions.
