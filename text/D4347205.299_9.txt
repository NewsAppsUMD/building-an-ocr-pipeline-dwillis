Il. PATIENT-RELATED FINDINGS
STANDARD OF CARE VIOLATIONS

15. The peer reviewers concurred that the Respondent did not meet the standard
of quality medical care in all ten patient records reviewed for reasons in whole or in part

as follows:

e The Respondent failed to adequately assess the patients for the purpose of
commencing opioid treatment because in whole or in part he failed to elicit
a comprehensive history, failed to conduct an adequate physical examination,
and failed to obtain prior medical records (Patients 1-10);

e The Respondent made non-specific referrals for alternative treatment such as
neurosurgery and physical therapy, but failed to provide a specific physician
or practice and did not document whether the patient complied with his
referral recommendation (Patients 1-10);

e The Respondent failed to discuss or apply the CDC standard of prescribing
less than 90 MME/day (Patients 1-10);

@ The Respondent consistently failed to check patientsâ€™ past and ongoing
medication history with the PDMP (Patients 1-10);

e The Respondent failed to provide adequate re-assessments to determine
whether there was a necessity to continue opioid therapy (Patients 1-10);

e The Respondent consistently maintained the patient on high doses of highly
addictive opioids which placed the patient at a higher risk for adverse events

of fatal or non-fatal overdoses, and an increased risk for opioid dependence
(Patients 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10); ,

3 The Respondent obtained prior hospital records for Patient 5 but failed to reference the visits in his notes to confirm
he had reviewed the records. :
