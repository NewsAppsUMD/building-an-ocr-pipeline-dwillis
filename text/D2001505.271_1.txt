summary suspension order and the summary suspension imposed on May 14, 2021 is reaffirmed
and continues. See COMAR 10.32.02.08H(1).

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, Dr. Mohiuddin has the right to request a full evidentiary
hearing before an Administrative Law Judge at the Office of Administrative Hearings. This
request will be granted if the Board receives a written request for the hearing within TEN (10)
days of the date of this letter. Any request for a hearing should be sent to Christine A. Farrelly,
Executive Director, at the Boardâ€™s address. If Dr. Mohiuddin requests such a hearing, the
regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set the hearing to begin within 30 days of
the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08I, though Dr. Mohiuddin may waive that 30-day
requirement.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel B resulting from

formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely yours,

Signature on File

Christine A. Farrelly, Executive Dist
Maryland State Board of Physicians
