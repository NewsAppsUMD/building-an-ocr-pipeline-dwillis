 

I have found that the Respondent engaged in unprofessional and immoral conduct in the
practice of medicine, and violated the Board’s sexual misconduct regulation by engaging in
sexual harassment as defined by COMAR 10.32.17.02(2). Based on those conclusions, the
Board’s sanctioning guidelines provide for a minimum sanction of reprimand, and a maximum
sanction of revocation. The guidelines provide for a minimum fine of $10,000.00 and a
maximum fine of $50,000.00. The Board seeks to impose the minimum sanction and minimum
fine available to them based on these charges.

The Respondent has a prior disciplinary history. He has been charged by the Board on
two previous occasions, once in 1996 and once in 2016. The Respondent demonstrated a
concerning lack of remorse of acceptance of responsibility for each of these incidents. The
Respondent blamed the 1996 incident on the hospital for failing to inventory the stock of his
remote office, and his ineffective attorney. In that incident, a twenty-three-year-old patient died
after receiving allergy injections for pollen and mites when she went into anaphylactic shock and
the Respondent did not have the appropriate antidote to treat her. He greatly downplayed his
role in the incident and did not accept responsibility. The Respondent’s counsel likewise
downplayed the 2016 incident where he prescribed medication without a license for several
months. Finally, in the instant case, the Respondent alleged that the patients either made up the
allegations against him, or misunderstood him due to his poor grasp of the Spanish language.
This is the Respondent’s third violation and accordingly, COMAR 10.32.02.07 supports a fine of

$10,000.00 as proposed by the Board.
