tight-fitting, high-waisted leggings, with no underwear. The waistband of the leggings stops an inch
below her belly button, The Patient was alone in the examination room with the Respondent,

her to lie down on a table, arid started rubbing on what she described as her lower stomach. He
continued, and his hand went under her pants, He was pushing, not rubbing, on her stomach. He
pressed with one ungloved hand, Normally he did not wear gloves when pressing her abdomen, He
pressed for less than a minute. Each push lasted about a second, He pustied horizontally across her
abdomen.

the clitoris, His fingers rubbed where the labia majora begins, in an area she described as right on
top of the labia majora, between the labia majora and the clitoris. He was rubbing, not pushing. The
duration was maybe one or two minutes or less, but it felt like five minutes to her. She was sure the
Respondent touched her just above the clitoris for an extended period of time. She testified he did
not touch the clitoris or the labia minora. She denied penetration, which she defined as entry into the
