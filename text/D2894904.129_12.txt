conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation of Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 14-

SANCTION

For over 25 years, the Board has given Dr. Baltatzis multiple chances to correct his
deficiencies by re-educating him on the essential components of quality medical care integral to
his practice. The Board’s objective was to enable Dr. Baltatzis to provide care and treatment
within appropriate standards, prevent patient harm, and enhance patient safety. At the OAH
hearing, however, despite the overwhelming evidence of his repetitive standard of care
violations, Dr. Baltatzis testified that the Board’s main complaint was his lack of adequate
documentation. (T. 381.) The panel now recognizes, with the benefit of hindsight, that prior
decisions enabling Dr. Baltatzis to retain his license were mistaken and gave him the unfounded

The imposition of progressive discipline is a disciplinary tool essential to the Board’s
mission of protecting the public. Based on Dr. Baltatzis’s successive violations, it is apparent that
the Board’s previous attempts to rehabilitate him were unsuccessful. Dr. Baltatzis, as he has

documentation in treating patients. Despite multiple courses, supervision, and years of Board
monitoring, it is obvious that he has learned little or nothing from the Board’s remedial efforts
and has shown no meaningful understanding of or commitment to the competent practice of
medicine. Based on Dr, Baltatzis’s propensity for minimizing his pervasive, serious deficiencies,
the panel concludes that the deficiencies are not remediable. Dr. Baltatzis’s insight with regard to
