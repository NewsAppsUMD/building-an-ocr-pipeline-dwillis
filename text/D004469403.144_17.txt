responsibility for what she had done. In responding to a question about her licensure status in
Virginia and New York, she said that she had not reapplied for a medical license in those states.

Having considered the entire record in this case, Panel B has determined, in its discretion,
that the reinstatement of Dr. Bailey’s Maryland medical license is not within the interest of the
health and welfare of the public and is not consistent with the best interests of the medical
profession. The Panel, therefore, denies her application for reinstatement.

ORDER

It is thus, by Disciplinary Panel B, hereby

ORDERED that the Application for Reinstatement of Medical License filed by Andrea
N. Bailey, M.D., former license number D44694, is DENIED; and it is further

ORDERED that Dr. Bailey shall not reapply for the reinstatement of her Maryland
medical license any earlier than two years from the date of this Order; and it is further

ORDERED that this Order is a public document. See Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. §§ 1-

607, 14.411.1(b)(2) and Gen. Prov. § 3-333(b)(6).
