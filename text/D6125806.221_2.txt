At Patient 1’s last appointment, on December 22, 2015, Dr. Singhal’s note stated that
Patient 1 would return in one month. Patient 1 did not formally terminate his medical
relationship with Dr. Singhal but stopped attending medical appointments. Dr. Singhal never
formally discharged Patient 1 as a patient but did not follow-up or reschedule the missed
appointments.

In 2016, Dr. Singhal asked Patient 1’s wife to help select the music for a retirement party
for an individual with whom they had worked. In June 2016, Dr. Singhal and Patient 1’s wife
attended that retirement party. After the party, Dr. Singhal and Patient 1’s wife went to Dr.
Singhal’s car and began kissing and then to his office for further sexual acts, which included oral
sex. After that, Dr. Singhal and Patient 1’s wife continued to talk or text nearly every day. Dr.
Singhal continued the sexual relationship, which included sending sexual messages to Patient 1’s
wife with photographs of their bodies and approximately four or five in-person encounters. In
December 2017, Patient 1 discovered his wife’s sexual relationship with Dr. Singhal. Dr.
Singhal and Patient 1’s wife then terminated their sexual relationship. Patient 1 filed a complaint
against Dr. Singhal at Dr. Singhal’s place of work. After Dr. Singhal’s employer instructed him
not to communicate with Patient 1 or his wife, Dr. Singhal sent a text message to them on
January 5, 2018, that stated that they “should be happy to know that [they] have successfully
damaged [his] present and future.”

Based on the Panel’s evaluation of the testimony of Patient 1, Patient 1’s wife, and Dr.
Singhal, Panel A makes certain additional factual findings that were not found by the ALJ:

1. Dr. Singhal discussed sexual side effects of medications that he had prescribed to

Patient 1 prior to his sexual relationship with Patient 1’s wife. As part of the
