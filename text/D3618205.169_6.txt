Il. THE COMPLAINT

5. The Board initiated an investigation of the Respondent after receiving a
complaint, dated July 18, 2018, from a pharmacy manager (the “Complainant”) of a
pharmacy located in Cambridge, Maryland. The Complainant reported that the pharmacy
had received an influx of prescriptions for oxycodone 30 mg, in quantities of 120 units
or greater, which were written/issued by the Respondent. The Complainant reported that
he was unable to contact the Respondent when questioning such prescribing. The
Complainant stated that despite not being able to reach the Respondent by telephone, he
observed her patients having “no problem” calling the Respondent on her cell phone and
reaching her. The Complainant stated that several of the Respondent’s patients have
never received narcotics previously but that the Respondent is prescribing oxycodone 30

mg on their first visits with her.

3 Oxycodone is an opioid analgesic and is a Schedule I controlled dangerous substance.
