Accordingly, the ALJ issued a Proposed Default Order, proposing that the Respondent be
found in default in this case, the Board adopt as fact the statements set out in the Allegations of
Fact in the Charges under the Maryland Respiratory Care Practitioners Act, the Respondent be
found to have violated § 14-SA-17(a)(3) and (26), and the Respondent’s license to practice
respiratory care in Maryland be revoked.

Neither party filed exceptions to the ALJ’s Proposed Default Order.

FINDINGS OF FACT

Board Disciplinary Panel A (“Panel A” or the “Panel”) adopts the ALI’s finding that the
Respondent defaulted. Because the Respondent defaulted, the following findings of fact are
adopted from the allegations of fact set forth in Charges under the Maryland Respiratory Care
Practitioners Act, issued on August 3, 2022, and are deemed proven by the preponderance of
evidence:
