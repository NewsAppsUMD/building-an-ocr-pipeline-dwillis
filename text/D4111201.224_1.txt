Conference informed Dr. Newbold that the failure to appear or to give timely notice of his inability
to appear at the prehearing conference could result in a decision against him. On August 22, 2023,
OAH also sent a scheduling order that notified the parties of the date and time of the prehearing
conference and gave instructions regarding the submission of any motions and discovery. None
of the hearing notices or correspondence were returned to OAH as undeliverable.

On August 29, 2023, the State submitted its prehearing conference statement and exhibits,
in accordance with the scheduling order. Dr. Newbold did not submit any prehearing conference
statement or exhibits. On October 5, 2023, the ALJ held the remote prehearing conference. The
administrative prosecutor appeared on behalf of the State. Dr. Newbold did not appear. After
waiting for Dr. Newbold until 9:50 a.m., the ALJ commenced the prehearing conference. The ALJ
noted that neither Dr. Newbold nor anyone authorized to represent him appeared at the prehearing
conference 20 minutes after the scheduled start time. The ALJ also noted that none of the notices
or correspondence were returned as undeliverable and there was no request for postponement filed
or any other communication from Dr. Newbold. The ALJ, thus, concluded that Dr. Newbold
received proper notice of the prehearing conference, and the State made a motion for a proposed
default order.

Under OAH’s rules of procedure, “{iJf, after receiving proper notice as provided in
Regulation .05C of this chapter, a party fails to attend or participate, either personally or through
a representative, in a prehearing conference, hearing, or other stage of a proceeding, the ALJ may
proceed in that party’s absence or may, in accordance with the hearing authority delegated by the
agency, issue a final or proposed default order against the defaulting party.” COMAR
