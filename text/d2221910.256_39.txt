the Respondent on the morning of March 1, 2014. There is no evidence showing the Respondent
provided any counseling to Patient A; there is no documentation of any counseling in the
medical record. The Respondent did not document in the medical record that Patient A’s
amniotic fluid was drained. The Respondent did not document the amount of Patient A’s blood

or the exact time the procedure ended. The Respondent did not document any post-operative
tissue examination or description of the fetal anomalies. Finally, the Respondent documented that
he observed Patient A for forty-five minutes post procedure, which is less than the one hour

In sum, the articles submitted by the Respondent do not support his position that his
treatment of Patient A met the standard of care.

office was unprofessional because he should have known that the fetus should have been
delivered in a higher level of care facility.

Dr. C. Browne opined that the Respondent’s care of Patient A did not constitute
unprofessional conduct. In addition, he opined that the Respondent’s record keeping did not

The testimony and documents in this case convincingly demonstrated that the

Respondent’s treatment of Patient A and his documentation in her medical record violated the
