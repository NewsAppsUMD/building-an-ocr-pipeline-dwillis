In considering which sanctions to recommend, I have considered the mitigating and
aggravating factors in COMAR 10.32.02,09B(5) and (6) as follows:
Mitigating Factors:
(a) The absence of a prior disciplinary record;
- The Respondent has a prior disciplinary record, which I shall discuss below.
(b) The offender self-reported the incident;
- The Respondent did not self-report.

(c) The offender voluntarily admitted the misconduct, made full disclosure to the
disciplinary panel and was cooperative during the disciplinary panel proceedings;

- The Respondent did not voluntarily admit misconduct. However, I heard no
evidence he did not cooperate during the disciplinary panel proceedings. Based on
that I give this factor slight weight in mitigation.

(d) The offender implemented remedial measures to correct or mitigate the harm
arising from the misconduct;

- The Respondent testified he stopped using the Ethibond sutures because his
"study ended. I do not find that applies to this factor. ‘

(e) The offender made good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify the
consequences of the misconduct,

- | find the same with this factor as 1 do with factor (d).
(f) The offender has been rehabilitated or exhibits rehabilitative potential;

~ The Respondent steadfastly denied wrongdoing from the inception of the
Board’s investigation through the hearing on the merits. .

(g) The misconduct was not premeditated;

- Per my discussion above, I find the Respondent knowingly and intentionally
engaged in the misconduct.

(h) There was no potential harm to patients or the public or other adverse impact;

- 1 find the Respondent placed the suture patients in potential harm. There is no
evidence his conduct actually harmed any of them. .
