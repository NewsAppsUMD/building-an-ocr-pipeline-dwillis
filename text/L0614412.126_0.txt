ORDER AFTER SHOW CAUSE HEARING

On December 1, 2015, Alyse Beck, a Respiratory Care Practitioner (“RCP”) licensed by
the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”) since 2013, entered into an agreement
with the Board wherein she agreed to enroll in the Maryland Professional Rehabilitation Program
(“MPRP”) within ten (10) business days of the agreement and comply with all of the MPRP’s
recommendations. Ms. Beck did not enroll in the MPRP. On May 18, 2016, following a show
cause hearing, Board Disciplinary Panel A (“Panel A’) issued an order finding that Ms. Beck
failed to comply with the terms of the December 1, 2015 agreement and ordered that her license
be suspended until she had complied with the agreement. On September 14, 2016, following
notification by the MPRP that Ms. Beck tested positive for alcohol and fentanyl in contravention
of her Participant Rehabilitation Agreement, Panel A issued a Notice to Show Cause alleging a
violation of the terms and conditions of the May 18, 2016 Order and the MPRP Participant
Rehabilitation Agreement. On December 7, 2016, Panel A held a hearing where Ms. Beck had
the opportunity to argue why her license should not be subject to further discipline.
