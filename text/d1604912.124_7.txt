medical record, the patient could send the records to “Lawrence Egbert, MD MPH,” and
suggested the patient tell his doctor that “Dr. Egbert” is a pain management specialist. This
training manual refers to the FEN members as patients as well. These documents indicate that
Dr. Egbert and FEN identify their members as patients, and Dr. Egbert is identified to them as a
physician. As discussed further below, the actions taken by Dr. Egbert were also the type of
actions that a physician undertakes, such as reviewing and evaluating patient medical records and
aiding the patients with their end of life decisions.
2. Review of Medical Records to Determine Diagnosis of Conditions,
Severity of Suffering and Possible Treatment Options is “In the Practice
of Medicine.”

Next, the Panel finds that the continuum of Dr. Egbert’s conduct was intertwined with
patient care, that is, involved patient welfare, health, and the potential for patient harm. Dr.
Egbert acted in his role as a physician both when he reviewed the medical records as part of his
duty as medical director of FEN as well as the actions he took as an Exit Guide.

Dr. Egbert argues in his exceptions that lawyers, nurses, insurance adjusters, nutritionists
and pharmacists all review patient records without engaging in the practice of medicine. While
that is true, each professional reviews records for different purposes. The Panel concludes that
Dr. Egbert cannot divest himself of his licensure or his medical training and expertise or his
purpose in reviewing the medical records, in considering whether he has acted as a physician.

The State’s expert, Dr. Silverman, opined that determinations based on medical records
about what disease or illness the person was suffering from, whether the individual had
intolerable suffering, and whether the care the individual was receiving was sufficient are

medical determinations because he made medical assessments about patients conditions. See
