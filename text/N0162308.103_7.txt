rehabilitation agreement with MPRP, Mr. Henson was again before Panel A based on yet another
violation of a disciplinary order and MPRP rehabilitation agreement, this time for ignoring the
clear prohibition on practicing while suspended. The State further argued that Mr. Henson’s non-

Panel A concludes that Mr. Henson violated the August 2022 Order by continuing to
practice as a nuclear medicine technologist from August 23, 2022, through F ebruary 22, 2023,
despite his license being suspended.
