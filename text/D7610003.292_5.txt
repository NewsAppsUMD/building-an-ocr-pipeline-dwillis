including on August 30, 2021. The CRNP added that the Respondent would often come to
work “very drowsy” and would be “an hour or two late.” On one occasion, approximately
one month prior to the incident, the CRNP asked the Respondent why he was so sleepy.
The CRNP recalled the Respondent saying that he had knee surgery and had taken his
Percocet around 3:00am or 4:00am that morning.

17. Recalling August 30, 2021, the CRNP explained that on other occasions
when the Respondent fell asleep at work, she could easily wake him to remind him that he
had patients waiting, however on that day, it was different. The CRNP added:

{H]e was harder to arouse . . . nothing was startling him. Like if you
try to wake him . . . he’d be right back to sleep. So, it’s, like, he wasn’t
even there. Like, he didn’t hear you at all.

We have phones going off constantly, people talking, patients coming

up to the desk. And he was just slouched down in his chair like this
asleep.

18. In addition, the CRNP observed one of the Respondent’s patients at the front
desk complaining about the care she received from the Respondent that morning. Among
the patient’s complaints was the fact that the Respondent gave the patient paperwork that
had the wrong name on it, he prescribed a medication that she was allergic to, and the
medication prescribed did not address the reason for her visit.°

19. The CRNP noted that at that time she, the Center Manager, and the Assistant

made the decision to alert the RMD of the Respondent’s concerning behavior.

 

5 Records indicate the patient arrived at the Center complaining of lower back pain. The Respondent
diagnosed the patient with acufe pharyngitis and prescribed an antibiotic: “PRESCRIBED cyclobenzaprine
10mg tablet: Take 1 tablet (Oral) every 8 hours PRN ~ Muscle Spasm:, Total 20 (Twenty) tablet{.]”
