Case No.: 2016-0933B
License No.: D24720

Dear Dr. Rustagi, Mr. Schwedt, and Ms. Rubin:

On September 14, 2016, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t II, § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014
Repl. Vol.). On September 28, 2016, Dr. Rustagi was given an opportunity to attend a hearing
before Disciplinary Panel B to show cause why the suspension should not be continued. Dr.
Rustagi attended the hearing on that date and was represented by Mervyn A. Schwedt, Esq. The
State was represented by Dawn Rubin, Assistant Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor.
Both parties presented extensive oral arguments at the show cause hearing.

After considering the arguments at the hearing and the investigative file, Disciplinary
Panel B determined that Dr. Rustagi’s continued practice would present a substantial risk of
serious harm to the public health, safety or welfare and, therefore, affirmed the summary
suspension imposed on September 14, 2016. Disciplinary Panel B, through its counsel, advised
Dr. Rustagi of this decision orally on the hearing date.

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Dr. Rustagi has the right to request a full evidentiary hearing before an Administrative
Law Judge. This request will be granted if the Board receives a written request for the hearing
within ten days of the date of this letter. Any request for a hearing should be sent to Christine
