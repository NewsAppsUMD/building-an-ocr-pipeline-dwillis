Re: Spencer D. Thomas, M.D.
Case No.: 2220-0069
License No.: D82725

Dear Dr. Thomas and Mr. Malizio:

On October 2, 2019, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl.
Vol. and 2018 Supp.). Dr. Thomas was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing
before Disciplinary Panel A to show cause why that suspension should not be continued on
October 16, 2019. Dr. Thomas participated in the hearing by telephone conference on that date.
The State was represented by Adam Malizio, Assistant Attorney General, Administrative
Prosecutor. Both parties presented oral arguments at the post-deprivation hearing.

After consideration of the presentations of the parties, Disciplinary Panel A determined
that it would continue the summary suspension imposed on October 2, 2019. Disciplinary Panel
A thus will not lift the order of summary suspension. Disciplinary Panel A finds that the public
health, safety, and welfare imperatively requires the summary suspension of Dr. Thomas’s
license to practice medicine. See State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2)(i). The order of summary
suspension is thus reaffirmed and continues in effect. See COMAR 10.32.02.08H(1).

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, Dr. Thomas has the right to request a full evidentiary
hearing before an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Administrative Hearings. This
