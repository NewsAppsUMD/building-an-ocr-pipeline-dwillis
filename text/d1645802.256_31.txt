59. When Patient D presented at the Respondent's office on April 8, 2013, she was referred
for emergency surgery to address spinal cord damage and compression that resulted in loss of
bowel and bladder function.

60. A urine drug screen was conducted on April 8, 2013, but the results were determined to
be inaccurate because there were no results for oxycodone, even though she was taking high
doses of the drug at the time of the test.

61. The surgery was able to restore her bladder and bowel function.

62. . When she first saw the Respondent on April 8, 2013, Patient D had been prescribed high
doses of oxycodone (80 mg) every eight hours and oxycontin (30 mg) every four to six hours.
She was also prescribed Fentanyl patches for her lower back. These medications were
prescribed by a previous physician, Ronald Hairston, M.D., but were unable to be verified since
Dr. Hairston issued his medical summary prior to closing his medical practice in April 2011 and
the urine drug screen results were inconclusive.

63. The Respondent schedules his pain management patients for follow-up on two week
intervals. In the case of Patient D, during the months of May and July 2013, the Respondent saw
Patient D much more frequently and during these visits gave her prescriptions for two weeks
worth of medication, even though the medication would not have run out if it was taken
appropriately during that shortened period.

64. Following her surgery, Patient D was given short term acting opioids for pain,

65. The Respondent did not utilize any other modalities of treatment for Patient D, including
the use of neuromodulator medications which would include anticonvulsants and

antidepressants.
