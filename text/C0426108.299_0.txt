FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

Ahmed Gbadamosi, PA-C, is a physician assistant licensed by the Maryland State Board
of Physicians (“Board”). Mr. Gbadamosi was first licensed by the Board on June 29, 2010. After
his license expired on June 30, 2013, he subsequently applied for reinstatement in September,
2014, which was granted by the Board on October 28, 2014. He has been continuously licensed
in Maryland since that date, having renewed his license in 2015 and 2017.

In 2010, Mr. Gbadamosi moved to Georgia and remained there until 2015, at which point
he returned to Maryland. On February 18, 2014, while he lived in Georgia, Mr. Gbadamosi
pleaded guilty to and was convicted of criminal trespass in the State Court of Cobb County,
Georgia. He was sentenced to twelve months confinement, was required to serve one day of that
sentence and was placed on probation for the remainder of the twelve-month period, On his
September 2014 reinstatement application, Mr. Gbadamosi answered “NO” to a question asking
whether he had been charged with or convicted of any criminal act.

During Mr, Gbadamosi’s license renewal process in 2017, he was required to submit to a
criminal history background check, pursuant to § 15-307(g) of the Health Occupations Article.’
That background check flagged his 2014 criminal conviction in Georgia, and led to a Board
‘ In 2015, the Maryland General Assembly enacted legislation that required all applicants for initial licensure,

renewal, and reinstatement to obtain a criminal history records check, beginning October 1, 2016. See Senate Bill
449, ch. 34, 2015 Md, Laws 178. .
