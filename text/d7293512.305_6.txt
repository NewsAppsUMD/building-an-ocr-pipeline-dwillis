Il. Testimony Regarding the Use of a Chaperone - (Respondent Exception 2)

Dr. Basco claims that the ALJ ignored evidence that Dr. Basco consistently had a
chaperone with him when examining patients. He cites seven witness statements to demonstrate
that he consistently used a chaperone. Dr. Basco claims that the Panel should find that he used a
chaperone and, therefore, was not alone in the room with Patient B, as she alleged.

Of Dr. Basco’s seven witness statements, the majority do not support his claim that he
used a chaperone. Two witness statements do not concern his use of a chaperone at all.
Specifically, a former patient of Dr. Basco did not testify about Dr. Basco’s use of a chaperone
and the Acting Human Resources Director at his second employer, did not testify about Dr.
Basco’s use of a chaperone.

Physician A, Dr, Basco’s former employer, discussed chaperones in his testimony, but
did not verify that Dr. Basco used a chaperone. Rather, he testified that a team of people were
available to Dr. Basco to serve as a chaperone.

Dr. Basco presented written statements from a medical assistant who worked with Dr.
Basco at Physician A’s office and a nurse co-worker at his second employer. The medical
assistant stated that she never saw Dr. Basco enter a patient room without a chaperone. The
nurse stated that she did not see Dr. Basco alone with a patient.

Two other witnesses who describe Dr. Basco’s use of a chaperone were Employee C, a
receptionist/assistant at the Physician A’s office, and Employee D, a nurse midwife at Physician
A’s office. These witnesses also testified about the specific day at issue regarding Patient B.
The ALJ deemed these witnesses’ statements to be “questionable, if not overtly false.”
Employee D testified that she herself was the chaperone for Dr. Basco and Patient B on June 18,

2012. This testimony was untrue. Employee D’s testimony was contradicted by rebuttal
