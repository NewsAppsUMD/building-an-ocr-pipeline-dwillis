 

[Board Staff]: Can you just describe in detail the nature of your
relationship with her?

[The Respondent]:. Ican’t. I don’t remember.

[Board Staff]: _ What don’t you remember? .. .

[The Respondent]: Anything.

[Board Staff]: So you don’t remember treating her as a patient?

[The Respondent]: Not to the level of certainty .. . that would allow me
to say it’s a fact.

[Board Staff]: So these notes... that you provided to the Board in
writing, were those notes that you recalled or are
those contemporaneous notes from when you were
treating her?

[The Respondent}: Not sure. | think they’re contemporaneous, but my
. memory is wiped.

30. The Respondent repeatedly said during the interview that he could not recall details
about his treatment or personal contact with the Patient after she was discharged. When shown
copies of specific text messages, including an exchange of heart emojis and references to baths,
the Respondent answered, “Good question; don’t know.” When asked to discuss any intimate
contact with the Patient, the Respondent answered, “I can’t because it’s wiped from my memory.”
He later described his memory loss about his relationship with the Patient as follows: “I can’t see
ot feel or remember the experience, but I’m left with these symptoms that point to an experience
and I can’t say what the experience is.”

31, When asked about exchanging text messages that may have had sexual innuendos,
the Respondent said that “anything’s open game in. therapy, you could talk about anything, that is
the safety about therapy, is that’s a safe place to discuss anything.” He said that he would have

sent such messages to the Patient for “her therapy.”
