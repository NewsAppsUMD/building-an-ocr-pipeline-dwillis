Goles sent a letter to MPRP acknowledging that she had failed to provide the documentation
MPRP requested. She also claimed that she was unable to comply with these requirements due to
an illness and asked for additional time to comply. MPRP informed Ms. Goles that she would
have until May 9, 2022, as a final deadline to meet with one of the approved entities to receive a
second opinion and to provide the requested documentation. Ms. Goles did not comply with
MPRP’s directive regarding the May 9, 2022 deadline. On May 10, 2022, Ms. Goles sent a letter
to MPRP explaining her disagreements with the IME report, notifying MPRP that she was
unwilling to consider the recommended treatment at that time, and requesting additional time to
obtain a second opinion, On May 12, 2022, MPRP closed her case for cause and sent Ms. Goles
and the Board a letter to that effect.

Show Cause Hearing

On October 26, 2022, Panel B issued a Violation of Consent Order and Notice to Show
Cause, alleging that Ms. Goles violated the terms and conditions of her July 19, 2021 Consent
Order for failing to fully participate and comply with treatment recommended by MPRP.

Ms. Goles appeared before Panel B on January 25, 2023 and argued that she should be
given another chance to comply with the Consent Order. The Administrative Prosecutor argued
that Ms. Goles’s license should be revoked because she declined the treatment directed by MPRP.
The Administrative Prosecutor also argued that, based on the numerous delays and postponements,
the Board should conclude that Ms. Goles is not willing to undergo the necessary treatment.

At the Show Cause Hearing, Ms. Goles admitted that she was directed to go to treatment
and that she was given the opportunity to seek a second opinion. Ms. Goles concedes that she “did

not comply with the recommendation.”
