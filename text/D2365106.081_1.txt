On January 28, 2021, the Office of the Attorney General filed with the Maryland Board of
Physicians (the “Board”) a petition to suspend Dr. Torres’s license to medicine (‘the Petition’)
and a proposed show cause order pursuant to section 14-404(b)(1) of the Maryland Medical
Practice Act in Case Number 2219-0154B. The statute provides:

(1) On the filing of certified docket entries with the Board by the Office of the
Attorney General, a disciplinary panel shall order the suspension of a
license if the licensee is convicted of or pleads guilty or nolo contendere
with respect to a crime involving moral turpitude, whether or not any appeal
or other proceeding is pending to have the conviction or plea set aside.

Md. Code Ann., Health Occupations Article (“Health Occ.”) § 14-404(b) (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2018
Supp.). Attached to the Petition were copies of the indictment, certified docket entries, and
transcripts of the Judge’s ruling and sentencing hearing.

On March 2, 2021, Dr. Torres, through his counsel, filed a response to the Petition and
show cause order and requested that the Panel stay the proceedings and that an evidentiary hearing
be scheduled after Dr. Torres’s commitment to the Maryland Department of Health (“MDH”) is
rescinded and after the appeal of his criminal convictions was decided.? On March 24, 2021,
pursuant to COMAR 10.32.02.07 E(3), Board Disciplinary Panel B (“Panel B”), in its discretion,
denied Dr. Torres’s request for an evidentiary hearing. The Panel also denied the request for a
stay pending the criminal appeal because Health Occupations Article § 14-404(b)(1) requires the
‘suspension of a license if a licensee is convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude regardless
of whether any appeal is pending.

Having reviewed and considered the entire record in this case, Panel B issues this Final

Decision and Order. COMAR 10.32.02.07H(1).

2 Dr. Torres’s request for a hearing and stay of the proceedings will be discussed in further detail, below.
