- .years, was required to certify that he would comply with the applicable statutory provisions and
regulations pertaining to the practice of medicine in Virginia, and still the problems with
- overutilization of health care services and failing to meet appropriate standards of care persisted.
. In light of this prior.history, I believe the imposition of a suspension is appropriate. I further find
that there is a statutory basis for a suspension for a period of no less than twelve months as the
statute provides for a range of sanctions spanning from reprimand to revocation for the reciprocal
discipline violations and specifically allows for the imposition of the same sanction imposed by
the foreign licensing authority. COMAR 10.32.02.10B. For these reasons, L agree with the State
that such a suspension is a “very reasonable” sanction and I recommend that the Board, in
' “comity with the Virginia Board’s action, suspend the Respondent’s medical license for an
indefinite period of not less than twelve months, to begin when the Board issues its final ordér in
this-matter.
PROPOSED CONCLUSIONS. OF LAW

‘the Respondent is subject to the disciplinary sanctions of an indefinite suspension of his medical
license for a period not less than twelve months for the cited violations. Jd.; COMAR
. 10.32.02.09A(2); COMAR 10.32.02.10. . . . |
