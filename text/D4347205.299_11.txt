e The Respondent’s notes lacked details, were repetitive, and often illegible
(Patients 1-10). For example, most notes document the same assessment and
treatment: “exercise” or “diet and exercise”;

e The Respondent routinely repeated the same examination findings for the
neurological, extremities and back as “within normal limits” (“‘wnl’)
(Patients 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6);

e The Respondent failed to adequately document follow-up notes (Patients 1,
2, 3, 5, 9 and 10). For example, the Respondent did not document treatment
plans, specific responses to treatment;

e The Respondent failed to document that he adequately addressed with the
patient inconsistent urine drug screens (Patients 1, 2, 3, 5,9 and 10); and

e There was a continued discrepancy between the patient’s recorded pain score
and the pain score documented by the Respondent (Patients 1 and 5),

18.. The Respondent’s actions and inactions as outlined in pertinent part above in
whole or in part is evidence of deficiencies in the Respondent’s record keeping in violation
of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(40).
