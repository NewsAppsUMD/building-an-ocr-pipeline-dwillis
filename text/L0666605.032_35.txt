I conclude that it is immaterial to my decision whether a...; required to file the
10-Day Report. The law requires hospitals to file the report so that the Board may have prompt
information about conduct that might warrant an investigation. The report does not establish a
violation of the licensing statute; it is for Board informational purposes only. After investigation,
the Board may file charges and seek disciplinary action against a licensee. Sanctions may not be
imposed until a licensed RCP has been afforded an cgspeatuiiy for an administrative hearing.*”

Sanction

In this case, the Board seeks to impose the disciplinary sanction of revocation. Health
Occ. § 14-5A-17; COMAR 10.32.02.09. The Respondent contends that no violation was proven
and, therefore, no sanction is warranted.

I have explained above the many instances of unprofessional and incompetent behavior
exhibited by the Respondent during her employment This persisted despite
continuous training, counseling, an EAP referral, written warnings, and the enduring ee
guidance of her supervisor. The Respondent has demonstrated through her actions that she is
unable to comply with the requirements of her profession.

I am mindful that the Respondent is a single mother who has succeeded in obtaining the
necessary education through diligence and persistence in the face of personal challenges in order
to pursue licensure and a career as a respiratory therapist. Loss of her license will dash all her
hopes for that career and have a devastating effect on her ability to provide for herself and her
children. I considered whether a lesser sanction such as a fine, suspension, anger management,
or counseling would be appropriate. I decline to recommend those sanctions because the
Respondent was already provided many opportunities to change and a lot of counseling from

Es. For reasons that are not clear to me, the Respondent was unable or unwilling to respond ~
