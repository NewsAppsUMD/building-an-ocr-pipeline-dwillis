August 29, 2019, MPRP reported to the Board that Dr. Burbano admitted to violating his
Rehabilitation Agreement. By letter, dated August 30, 2019, the Board requested that Dr.
Burbano provide a response to the allegation that he violated his Rehabilitation Agreement. By
letter to the Board, dated September 6, 2019, Dr. Burbano admitted that he violated his
Rehabilitation Agreement on two occasions.

Show Cause Hearing

On November 1, 2019, Panel A issued a Violation of Consent Order and Notice to Show
Cause, alleging a violation of the May 9, 2019 Consent Order for failing to comply with his
Rehabilitation Agreement. On December 4, 2019, Dr. Burbano appeared at a show cause
hearing before Panel A and was represented by counsel.

During the hearing, Dr. Burbano admitted that he violated the Consent Order but asked
the Panel not to extend his suspension and, instead, to impose a reprimand, or in the alternative,
to extend the suspension for a period not to exceed 90 days. In response, the Administrative
Prosecutor argued that the two violations of the Rehabilitation Agreement were undisputed and
recommended that the period of suspension be extended for a minimum of one year given the
public safety concerns at issue.

The Panel finds that, due to the nature of the violations, an additional period of
suspension for a minimum of six months is necessary under the circumstances to ensure the
safety and protection of the public.

CONCLUSION OF LAW
Panel A finds that Dr. Burbano violated the condition of the May 9, 2019 Consent Order

that required him to comply with the terms and conditions of his Rehabilitation Agreement with

MPRP.
