Re: Surrender of License to Practice Medicine
Richard Falcioni, PA-C

License Number: C00537

Case Number: 7718-0120

Dear Dr. Freas and Members of the Disciplinary Panel B

Please be advised that, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. (“Health Occ.”)
§15-312(2014 Repl. Vol. & 2017 Supp.), I have decided to SURRENDER my license to
practice as a physician assistant in the State of Maryland, License Number C00537,
effective immediately. I understand that upon surrender of my license, I may not give
medical advice or treatment to any individual, with or without compensation, and cannot
prescribe medications or otherwise engage in the practice of medicine in the State of

Disciplinary Panel B’s (“Panel B”) acceptance, becomes a FINAL ORDER of Panel B
of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”).

March 15, 2018, Panel B issued disciplinary charges against me under Health Occ. § 15-
314(a)(22) and (40). Specifically, Panel B alleged that I had failed to meet the standards
of quality medical care and keep adequate records for multiple patients. I resolved these
disciplinary charges through entering into a Consent Order with Panel B, dated June 12,
2018 (the “Consent Order”), in which Panel B found that I violated Health Occ. § 15-
314(a)(22) and (40). The Consent Order imposed a reprimand and placed me on
probation for a minimum of two (2) years with certain terms and conditions including
that I cease prescribing controlled dangerous substances, with certain limited exceptions,
that I complete panel-approved courses in recordkeeping and pain management within six
(6) months of the Consent Order, and that I undergo a peer and/or chart review at the
