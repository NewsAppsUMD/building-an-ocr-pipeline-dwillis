Re: Robert Hardi, M.D.
Case No.: 2218-0152A
License No.: D30771

Dear Dr. Hardi and Counsel:

On March 5, 2019, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl.
Vol.).

On March 13, 2019, Disciplinary Panel A held a post deprivation hearing to show cause
why that suspension should not be continued. You attended the hearing on that date along with
your counsel, Mr. Wilkenfeld. The State was represented by Michael Brown, Assistant Attorney
General, Administrative Prosecutor. Both parties presented oral arguments at the hearing. You
also submitted three exhibits that the Board accepted and considered as part of the record.

After considering these arguments at the hearing, the exhibits, and the investigative file,
Disciplinary Panel A determined that it would continue the summary suspension imposed on
March 5, 2019. Disciplinary Panel A thus will not lift the summary suspension order.
Disciplinary Panel A finds that the public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires the
suspension of Dr. Hardi’s license. See State Gov’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i). The order of summary
suspension is thus reaffirmed and continues. See COMAR 10.32. 02.08H(1). Disciplinary Panel
