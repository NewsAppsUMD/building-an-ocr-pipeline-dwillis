ORDER OF DEFAULT

On June 22, 2020, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
(“Board”) charged James Lee, Jr., RCP, with fraudulently or deceptively obtaining or attempting
to obtain a license, unprofessional or immoral conduct in the practice of respiratory care, willfully
making or filing a false report or record in the practice of respiratory care, and failure to cooperate
with a lawful investigation conducted by the Board or a disciplinary panel. See Md. Code Ann.,
Health Occ. § 14-5A-17(a)(1), (3), (10), and (26) (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2019 Supp.). On October 7,
2020, the case was referred to the Office of Administrative Hearings (“OAH”) for an evidentiary
hearing.

On October 15, 2020, OAH mailed a Notice of Telephone Scheduling Conference to Mr.
Lee and the State, at their respective addresses of record, notifying the parties that a telephone
scheduling conference would be held on November 6, 2020, at 9:30 a.m. The Notice mailed to
Mr. Lee was not returned as undeliverable. On November 6, 2020, at 9:30 a.m., the ALJ called
Mr. Lee five times using the telephone number listed on Mr. Lee’s renewal application, but Mr.
Lee did not answer the phone and the voicemail stated that the voice mailbox was full and could
not accept any messages. After waiting approximately twenty minutes past the scheduled time for
the conference, the ALJ held the scheduling conference in the absence of Mr. Lee. The

administrative prosecutor appeared on behalf of the State.
