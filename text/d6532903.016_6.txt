electronic file, and there is no doubt that he did so intentionally.

Dr. Abassi’s explanations for his accessing the remaining confidential medical records
are also untenable. The Hospital reviewed Dr. Abassi’s computer access from November 1,
2013, though January 8, 2014. The audit found that, during this period Dr. Abassi accessed
records of 53 patients, which he had no legitimate basis viewing.

One of Dr. Abassi’s explanations is that he accessed the medical records in order to
comply with a request from an Emergency Room physician to complete a death certificate. He

find the correct patient. Dr. Abassi further testified that the Emergency Room death at issue
occurred within 24 hours of the Emergency Room physician’s request for him to complete the
death certificate and that a death certificate must be signed within 72 hours of the death. The
evidence shows, however, that the most recent Emergency Room death prior to late December
2013, was September 11, 2013, several months before Dr. Abassi claims he was asked to sign the
death certificate. (Tr., 7/21/2015, at 179-80; Joint Ex. 10-29 at 3.)

In light of the specific and reliable evidence contradicting Dr. Abassi’s testimony, the

the witnesses who testified in general about his professionalism and integrity. The Panel does not
