In August of 2017, the Hospital placed Ms. Hernandez on a performance improvement
plan. In December of 2017, Ms. Hernandez received two written reports pertaining to her deficient
clinical skills and her inappropriate behavior towards her coworkers. The patient care issues
continued throughout 2018 and 2019 and Ms. Hernandez was required to attend the Hospital’s
Employee Assistance Program for her communication issues, behavior, and unprofessionalism.
On February 1, 2019, Ms. Hernandez received her third written warning and was advised that if
her communication and clinical skills did not improve, her employment could be terminated.

On August 15, 2019, Ms. Hernandez resigned from her position and the Hospital filed a
10-day report with the Board stating that Ms. Hernandez resigned prior to a pending termination.
On August 18, 2019, Ms. Hernandez reported to the Hospital, for the first time, that she was
harassed, accosted, and verbally abused by co-workers at the Hospital. After leaving the Hospital,
Ms. Hernandez was terminated from three respiratory care therapist jobs in Maryland in 2020
before moving to California.

CONSIDERATION OF EXCEPTIONS

Professional Incompetence

The ALJ found that the record contained overwhelming evidence that Ms. Hernandez was
incompetent to practice respiratory care while employed at the Hospital based on her lack of
knowledge of the proper care and treatment of patients. Ms. Hernandez argues that the ALJ failed
to consider the uncontroverted and undisputed testimony that she has successfully been performing
the duties of her job as a respiratory care practitioner in California after she left the Hospital. To
that end, Ms. Hernandez asks the Panel to admit a letter from her current employer, labeled as R4
in the record extract attached to Ms. Hernandez’s exceptions, pursuant to the Board’s regulations

which allow for additional evidence during the oral exceptions hearing.
