11. Thereafter, on November 16, 2020, the Respondent initiated two surgical
procedures. The Respondent was unsuccessful in performing the intended procedures,
displayed vision and dexterity problems during the procedures, refused to wear his
prescription glasses during the procedures, had a visible hand tremor and the procedures
took much longer than expected.

12. The first procedure was a left percutaneous nephrectomy with placement of
an occlusion balloon catheter in the left ureter. During the procedure, staff of Health Care
Facility A observed that for 60-90 minutes the Respondent had difficulty cannulating the
patient’s ureter and was unable to locate the ureteral orifice in the bladder. This caused
trauma to the bladder, resulting in bleeding. The patient was admitted to Health Care
Facility A with bladder irrigation for the hematuria.

13. During this first procedure, supervisory staff at Health Care Facility A was
alerted that Respondent refused to wear his glasses as required, and the procedure was
taking longer than expected. Supervisory staff at Health Care Facility A alerted leadership
of the Respondent’s actions during the first procedure by text message: “Please call me.
We need someone ASAP. He doesn’t have his glasses on and won’t put them on, because
he can’t see. The FA [first assistant] and scrub tech are giving him direct guidance. He has
a ureter in his hand and can’t thread the catheter. He can’t see.” The Respondent thereafter
was directed to wear his glasses.

14. Additionally, during the first procedure, staff of Health Care Facility A

observed the Respondent having a visible hand tremor.
