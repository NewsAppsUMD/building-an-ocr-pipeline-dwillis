ORDER AFTER SHOW CAUSE HEARING

On December 1, 2015, Alyse Beck, a Respiratory Care Practitioner (“RCP”) licensed by
the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board’”) since 2013, entered into an agreement
with the Board wherein she agreed to enroll in the Maryland Professional Rehabilitation Program
(“MPRP”) within ten (10) business days of the agreement and comply with all of the MPRP’s
recommendations. Ms. Beck did not enroll in the MPRP. On March 31, 2016 the Board issued a
Notice to Show Cause alleging a violation of the agreement based on Ms. Beck’s failure to enroll
in the MPRP.

On May 11, 2016, Ms. Beck appeared at a Show Cause hearing before Board
Disciplinary Panel A (“Panel A”). The State presented evidence of Ms. Beck’s violation and
argued that Ms. Beck’s license should be suspended until she complies with the terms of the
December 1, 2015 agreement. Ms. Beck conceded that she violated the December 1, 2015
agreement.

Panel A finds that Ms. Beck failed to comply with the terms of the December 1, 2015
agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, the Panel may take any action authorized under Section
14-5A-17(a) of the Maryland Medical Practice Act, which includes a reprimand, probation,
suspension, and/or revocation.

ORDER

On an affirmative vote of a majority of a quorum of Disciplinary Panel A, it is hereby:
