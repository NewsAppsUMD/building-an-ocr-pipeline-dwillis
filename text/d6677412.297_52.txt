150. After their conversation, the Respondent examined Patient 5. He directed Patient
5 to lie down on the examination table and pull down her pants and panties to the point just
above the crack in her buttocks. (Test. Patient 5, T. at 116; State’s Ex. 14 at 18-20.)

151. When he started examining Patient 5, Respondent began by squeezing Patient 5’s
legs hard, asking Patient 5 if it hurt as he squeezed or pressed down on certain parts of her legs.
(Test. Patient 5, T. at 116.) ,

152. The Respondent continued squeezing Patient 5’s legs moving upward toward her
buttocks. He continued moying up until he reached an area close to Patient 5’s rectal area (ie.,
anus). He also got close to Patient 5’s vagina. (Test. Patient 5, T. at 116.)

153. The Respondent also began squeezing Patient 5’s thigh. (State’s Ex. 14 at 4-5,
18.)

154. When the Respondent had finished examining Patient 5 on November 27, 2013,
he asked Patient 5 whether she wanted to get another cortisone injection, and she told him, yes,
she wanted one. (Test. Patient 5; T. at 117.) .

155. Because the Respondent had. examined her in her rectal/anal and vagina areas,
Patient 5 felt weird and uncomfortable after the examination had concluded, Patient 5 did not
expect the Respondent to examine her in those areas of her body. Additionally, the Respondent
had never examined Patient 5 while she was lying on her stomach during previous visits. (Test. -
Patient 5; T. at 117-18.)

156. No chaperone was present in the examination room on November 27, 2013 when
the Respondent examined Patient 5. Patient 5 did not request a chaperone on that occasion,
because she did not believe one was necessary since she was not having a gynecological

examination. (Test. Patient 5; T. at 118-19.)
