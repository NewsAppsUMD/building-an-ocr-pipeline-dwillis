the practice of medicine. The fact that the Respondent provided this “example” of the
complicated cases he handled merits the conclusion that he recommended to other members that
they should seek further medical treatment rather than ending their lives.

It was only after the Respondent reviewed the patients’ medical documents that he was
able to determine whether they would be accepted for FEN’s assistance with suicide. According
to the Respondent, if he determined the patient had other alternatives for treatment, he
recommended against suicide and recommended the appropriate medical treatment.

In light of the admitted fact that the Respondent made medical diagnoses and
determinations that some patients should seek additional or alternative medical treatment, I find
the Respondent’s argument that he did not practice medicine as the Medical Director, and that a
lay person could have served as the Medical Director to be disingenuous. Although it may be
true that a layperson could have served as Medical Director and could have made decisions
accepting patients for assisted suicide based upon criteria established by the FEN, the fact is that
the Respondent is a physician and he clearly used his medical knowledge and expertise in
making medical determinations and prescribed treatment that would help alleviate some of the
symptoms of some patients’ medical conditions. Indeed, in the example the Respondent gave, the
Respondent even suggested that the patient could have her primary care physician consult with
him regarding his advisement that she should seek additional treatment for her pain. I find that
the Respondent’s act of reviewing medical documentation and making determinations regarding
treatment patients should receive constituted medical practice.

Similarly, I find that by virtue of the fact that the Respondent decided when patients
could potentially benefit from medical treatment in lieu of suicide, he also decided when patients
could not potentially benefit from additional medical treatment in lieu of suicide. According to

the unrebutted evidence, the FEN accepted applications and assisted in suicides of patients who
