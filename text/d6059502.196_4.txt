It has come to my attention that an anonymous complaint was filed
against me June 1, 2015. | was said to have had slurred speech and
irregular handwriting at work. | do not recall being impaired at work at any
time during that day. | had taken an Ativan? and a Benadryl as prescribed
for a panic attack prior to work on June 1, which may have been what was
observed.

Subsequently - on June 2, 24 hours later, on my nonworking day | was
asked to come in to the hospital for a random toxicology. | had had a

drink at lunch this day, as | was not working and did not expect testing. |

was well known to be a long time non drinker by staff, so when my alcohol

level was mildly elevated, | had to admit | had fallen off the wagon, in that |

had not maintained total abstinence. At no time did | drink before or
during work, or to excess. | admit to an ongoing problem with alcohol
abuse, and | had relapsed â€” | had previously been sober 5 % years.

11. On December 4, 2015, Board staff interviewed Respondent under oath.

Respondent testified to the following:

... | had an anxiety attack before work, took an Ativan and Benadryl. | was
reportedly sleepy, and | admit that | was sleepy at work and sent home.

The following day, 24 hours later, on a non-workday, | was asked to come in and

do toxicology and | had been drinking that day. And | reiterate this was a non-

workday. And on that day | tested positive for alcohol.

I've self-prescribed Ativan...

12. On December 17, 2015, the Board received a facsimile of the laboratory
report from Hospital A. The report of urine and blood drug testing collected on June 2,
2015 at 3:55 p.m. revealed the following:

b. Ethanol level 36" mg/dL.

13. Pursuant to a Board subpoena to area pharmacies, a computer printout
from one of the pharmacies confirmed that Respondent wrote the following prescriptions
