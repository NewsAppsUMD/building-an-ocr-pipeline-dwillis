The State argued the existence of a significant aggravating factor, namely, the
Respondent's prior disciplinary history. Additionally, the State argucd the Respondent’s
disciplinary history demonstrates the Board gave him the opportunity to improve and remediate
the problems with his dispensing habits and his weight loss practice and he was not able to do so.
Based on the record before me, I find the State’s sanctioning recommendation to be appropriate.

While I do not believe the Respondent acted with malign intent, I do find it troubling that
he was not able to remediate the deficiencies in his dispensing habits and his weight loss practice
between March 2015 and February 2017. This is particularly concerning given that under the
Consent Order the Respondent was required to successfully complete Board-approved courses
focused on proper medical record keeping (which necessarily includes dispensary record
keeping) and on weight management medicine. Despite the additional remedial training, the
Respondent continued to have difficulty in these two areas of his medical practice. Given the
Respondent's prior disciplinary history and his likely awareness of the seriousness with which
licensees are expected to take the Board’s orders, | do not find any significant mitigating factor
that makes the Respondent’s continued practice deficiencies in any way excusable. | recommend
the Board adopt the State’s sanctioning recommendations in their entirety.
