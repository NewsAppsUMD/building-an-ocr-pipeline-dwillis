out another vial to provide to the patient before they woke up. The Respondent properly
completed the waste with Nurse A. Approximately 20 minutes later, Nurse A heard a loud
crash and found the Respondent unconscious on the floor of the operating room.

10. The Respondent was not breathing but did have a pulse. The physicians and
staff in the operating room at the time were able to revive the Respondent. Nurse A then
noticed a syringe sticking out of the Respondent’s left sock which was attached to tubing
and an angiocath in the Respondent’s foot.

11. Nurse A asked the Respondent what the angiocath was and whether it was
used to inject the Versed that Nurse A had just “wasted” with the Respondent. The
Respondent stated that it was not the Versed but rather Propofol.” Nurse A looked at the
syringe and confirmed that the substance was a cloudy white substance that has the
appearance of this medication.

12. The Respondent was then transported to the emergency room department at
the Facility for an evaluation.

13. Nurse A also stated that approximately one week prior to the event in the
operating room on March 20, 2023, the Respondent was acting “very erratic, and
strangely...very giddy initially and very hyper...which is very out of character” for the

Respondent. Then the Respondent’s mood “immediately shifted during the same surgery

deposited into the Cactus system and the clinician is to dispose of the syringe, vial, needle, etc. in
front of the nurse who then confirms the waste electronically with a fingerprint in the Pyxis system.
