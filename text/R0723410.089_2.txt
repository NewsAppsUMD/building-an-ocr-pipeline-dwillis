the ALJ recommend to the disciplinary panel that Mr. Wilson’s license to practice as a
radiographer be revoked. |

Under OAH’s rules of procedure, “[i]f, after receiving proper notice, a party fails to
attend or participate in a prehearing conference, hearing, or other stage of a proceeding, the judge

by the agency, issue a final or proposed default order against the defaulting party.” COMAR

Radiographer,
