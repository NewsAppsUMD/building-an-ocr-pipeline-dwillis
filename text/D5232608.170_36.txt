Lalso note that the record reflects that the Respondent is well-regarded wl and those
with whom he has had professional contact. Martin Trpis, Esquire, deputy counsel for i.
provided a written response to the Board on behalf of the Respondent, and describes the
Respondent’s commitment to those he assists as “remarkable,” noting that his “personality and
proclivity to act altruistically to the degreé that he does, is quite uncommon,” and that his actions
demonstrate his “integrity, conscience-and beliefs.” (Bd. Ex. 7.) The Respondent also submitted
two letters, one from a social worker who worked with him in a Montgomery County program to
provide outreach and treatment to addicts and one from a social worker who worked with him
through the Montgomery County Crisis Center. Both praised his professionalism and competency
’ without reservation. (Resp. Ex. 8 and 9.)

In short, the record makes clear that despite the serious lapses of professionalism in this
case, the Respondent is a caring, compassionate physician, and my proposed disposition reflects
this conclusion, without diminishing the importance of sanctions, including remediation through
probation.
