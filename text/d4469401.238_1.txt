Past Criminal and Disciplinary History

Virginia

Dr. Bailey was arrested in February 2013, by Virginia criminal authorities, and pled
guilty in April 2013 to obtaining drugs by fraud and attempted prescription fraud between April
2010 and February 2013. The court deferred disposition until May 2015, at which time Dr.
Bailey was convicted of attempted prescription fraud pursuant to her guilty plea. In March 2015,
the Virginia Board of Medicine (“Virginia Board”) summarily suspended Dr. Bailey’s medical
license based on her writing of controlled substances prescriptions for her personal use in the
name of fictitious patients.
Maryland

Pursuant to a Consent Agreement dated April 2, 2015, the Maryland Board suspended Dr.
Bailey’s license until her license was reinstated by the Virginia Board. On July 22, 2015, the
Virginia Board subsequently stayed the suspension of Dr. Bailey’s license and on July 30, 2015,

the Maryland Board stayed her suspension in Maryland.
