ameliorated by the time the summary suspension was issued—was unsound. The Respondent’s
exceptions focus on his claim that the ALJ did not properly address his contention that
exculpatory evidence was purposely not presented to the Board panel before the panel issued the
order summarily suspending his license. Both parties filed a reply to the opposing party’s
exceptions.

On March 23, 2022, an exceptions hearing was held before Board Disciplinary Panel B
(“Panel B” or the “Panel’”).

I. FINDINGS OF FACT

Panel B finds that the following facts were proven by the preponderance of evidence:

1, The Respondent was originally licensed to practice medicine in Maryland on
August 3, 2000. The Respondent continually had his license renewed, and he was authorized to
practice medicine in Maryland from August 2000 until his medical license was summarily
suspended on July 2, 2021. The conduct of the Respondent that is the focus of this case occurred
while he was licensed by the Board. The Respondent is male.

2. The Respondent is board-certified in neurological surgery.

3. The Respondent has practiced neurosurgery, physical therapy, and pain
management in Maryland. The Respondent has held privileges at four hospitals in Maryland.
Complainant 1

4, Complainant 1, a female, has been a registered nurse for over 20 years and works
in the O.R. as a registered nurse.' Complainant 1 worked at a hospital in Maryland (the
“Hospital”) from May 2004 until October 2018.

' The Panel has used generic terms for individuals and facilities where possible in order protect
their reasonable expectation of privacy and for patients, their confidentiality. In addition, this

case involves issues of sexual harassment and inappropriate sexual conduct, and thus the Panel
does its best to keep the names of the victims confidential.
