instructed. In October 2012, the patient was given prescriptions for Percocet on October 3,
October 12, and October 20. These prescriptions were not provided in accordance with the
Respondent’s stated practice of visits every two weeks. It is unknown why so many
prescriptions for oxycodone were given in such a short time span.

On March 30, 2013, Patient E reported that her medications were stolen and requested
that the Respondent provide her with a new prescription. The Respondent complied and
provided the requested prescription without inquiring whether a police report was filed or the
circumstances that led to the theft. Claiming that a bottle of opioids was stolen should have
raised a red flag and caused the Respondent to conduct a further inquiry. Two months later, on
May 17, 2013, Patient E reported that her prescription was stolen. Again, without conducting
further inquiry, the Respondent provided her with a replacement prescription. This should have
raised another red flag, but apparently, the Respondent did not find a stolen bottle of opioids and
a lost prescription to be something that necessitated further inquiry. Additionally, no urine
Screens were performed to verify compliance.

The final red flag was raised when Patient E was charged with altering a prescription the
Respondent wrote for Percocet by changing the prescription from 30 tablets to 80 tablets. Asa
result of her arrest, Patient E was discharged from the Respondent's practice. Although
hindsight is clear, providing early refills without justification and failing to take steps to assure
compliance with prescriptions after an instance of a claimed theft of medication and a lost
prescription demonstrates a lack of care in the Respondent’s prescription practices. The
Respondent is acutely aware that opioids can be abused and diverted; however, he took no steps

to address that in this case despite two early warning signs.
