there were several hospitals closer to her home at which she could have received care and
treatment.

By treating Patient | and prescribing medications to her, including prescriptions for CDS,
Dr. Lightfoot compromised his objectivity and allowed his personal relationship with Patient 1
and concerns about her potential relapse to compromise his professional judgment and decision-
making ability. Dr. Lightfoot admitted that he knew that prescribing CDS to family members and
friends was frowned upon, yet he ignored his better judgment and treated Patient 1, not once, but
seven times at the hospital, and prescribed CDS to Patient 1 on four occasions outside of the
hospital. Dr. Lightfoot is guilty of unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine.

The State argues that the ALJ erroneously relied on a narrowly construed concept of
immoral conduct in reaching the conclusion that Dr. Lightfoot was not guilty of immoral conduct
in the practice of medicine. The ALJ found that because the care Dr. Lightfoot provided to Patient
1 was professional, there was no evidence that he exploited Patient 1 and, therefore, the ALJ did
not find that Dr. Lightfoot’s conduct was immoral. As discussed above, the Panel does not make
any findings regarding the care Dr. Lightfoot provided to Patient 1. While the Panel disagrees
with the ALJ’s reasoning, the Panel does not find that Dr. Lightfoot is guilty of immoral conduct
in the practice of medicine in this case.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Panel B concludes as a matter of law that Dr.
Lightfoot is guilty of unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation of Health
Oce. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii). The charge under Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(i) is dismissed.

SANCTION

The ALJ recommended a sanction of a reprimand, probation, and a fine of $10,000.00.

The ALJ did not recommend a length of time for the probation or any conditions of probation. The
