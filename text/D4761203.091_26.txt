the beginning of the study and works for the future using a variable and observes how human
subjects react to the variable, whether it’s a drug or a suture device as in Dr. MacKoul’s study.
Patients are de-identified in both types of studies. An IRB is required if the purpose is to contribute
to generalizable knowledge, typically through publication.

Dr. Prentice found it clear that Dr. MacKoul never engaged in a prospective study. He
opined, however, that if Dr. MacKoul initiated a study involving an appropriate scientific design
with standard randomization of patients to the two different suture types, such a study would be
prospective and subject to the federal regulations. Dr. Prentice did not opine on the specific
surgical actions taken by Dr. MacKoul in October, 2013, when he initiated his study of two groups
of patients, with Vicryl selected as the absorbable suture for one group of patients and Ethibond
as the nonabsorbable suture for a separate group. Nor did he opine on Dr. MacKoul’s aim to
compare the risk of cuff breakdown using the two different sutures for vaginal cuff closure
throughout the planned three-year study.

On cross examination, Dr. Prentice acknowledged that he was not provided with and did
not review Dr. MacKoul’s manuscript dated October 31, 2016 in preparation for his testimony.
According to Dr. Prentice, the Ethibond versus Vicryl study by Dr. MacKoul was a retrospective
study because Dr. MacKoul testified in his Board interview that it was retrospective. Dr. Prentice
further testified that Dr. MacKoul analyzed the data from the Ethibond study in a retrospective
chart review that was approved and deemed exemptas a collection of existing data under 45 C.F.R.
46.101(b)(4)"” by Integ Review IRB in 2018. Dr. Prentice’s opinion was unsupported by any

reliable documentary or testimonial evidence in the record showing that the 2018 IRB exemption

7 45 C.F.R. § 46.101(b)(4) exempts “research activities . . . involving the collection of existing data .. ..
