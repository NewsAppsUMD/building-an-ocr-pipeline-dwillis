In sum, the Respondent’s testimony concerning: (1) the slapping of the anesthetized
patient’s buttocks, (2) his statement to Complainant 2 that he wanted to spank her, and (3) his
interactions with Individual 4 prove to Panel B that the Respondent was neither a credible nor a
reliable witness.

UI. PANEL B’S FINDINGS CONCERNING ALJ FINDINGS FOR WHICH THE
RESPONDENT DID NOT TAKE EXCEPTION

The Respondent took exception to several of the ALJ’s findings and conclusions
concerning incidents in which the ALJ found that the Respondent’s conduct was unprofessional
and/or immoral. The Respondent, however, did not take exception to all of the ALJ’s proposed
findings and conclusions. Here, Panel B addresses findings and conclusions that the ALJ made
against the Respondent for which the Respondent did not take exception.

A. Complaint No. 2 —- Respondent’s Slapping the Anesthetized Patient’s Buttocks

The Respondent did not take exception to the ALJ’s findings and conclusions regarding
Complaint No. 2, where the ALJ found that the Respondent slapped the buttocks of an anesthetized
patient in the OR and that it constituted immoral and unprofessional conduct in the practice of
medicine. The evidence supports the ALJ’s findings and conclusions. The Respondent forcefully
slapped the patient’s buttocks when the patient was anesthetized while he said “Baby’s Got Back”
and moved in a rhythmic manner. There was no medical purpose for slapping the patient, and, of
course, the patient did not consent to it. The Panel concludes that the Respondent’s slapping of
the anesthetized patient’s buttocks constitutes immoral conduct in the practice of medicine, in
violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(i); and unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine,
in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii).
