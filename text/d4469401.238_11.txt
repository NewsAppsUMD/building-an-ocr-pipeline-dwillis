DISPOSITION

Dr. Bailey’s noncompliance is of serious concern to Panel B. The privilege of medical
licensure in Maryland involves a physician’s obligation to fulfill conditions necessary to ensure
fitness to practice medicine safely. In the 2016 Consent Order, Dr. Bailey was given an
opportunity to prove to Panel B, by undergoing rehabilitation and treatment with MPRP, that she
was fit to practice medicine safely. She failed to do so. Accordingly, the revocation of Dr.
Bailey’s license to practice medicine is the appropriate sanction in this case.

ORDER

It is, by Panel B, hereby:

ORDERED that the medical license of Andrea N. Bailey, M.D., license number D44694,
is REVOKED; and it is further

ORDERED that the summary suspension of the medical license of Andrea N. Bailey,
M.D. imposed by Panel B on July 17, 2017 and affirmed on July 27, 2017, is TERMINATED as
moot; and it is further

ORDERED that this is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Gen.

Prov. § 4-101 ef seq. (2014).
