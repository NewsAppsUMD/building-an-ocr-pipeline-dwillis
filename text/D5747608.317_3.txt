On July 7, 2017, the ALJ issued a Proposed Default Order, based upon the OAH

proceedings described above, which the ALJ recounted in the proposed decision. The ALJ also

proposed that the Panel:

1. Find the Respondent in default;

2. Adopt as fact the statements set out in the Allegations of Fact section of the
Charges;

3. Conclude as a matter of law that the Respondent violated the Maryland Medical

Practice Act, subsections 14-404(a)(3), (8), and (9) of the Health Occupations Article, Annotated
Code of Maryland, in the manner set forth in the Charges; and

4. Revoke the Respondent’s license to practice medicine in the State of Maryland.

On July 7, 2017, copies of the ALJ’s Proposed Default Order were mailed to Dr.
Dickinson, the administrative prosecutor, and the Board. The proposed decision notified the
parties that they may file written exceptions to the proposed decision but must do so within 15
days of the date of the proposed order. The proposed order states that any exceptions must be
sent to the Board with attention to the Board’s Executive Director.

The case came before Board Disciplinary Panel B for final disposition. Neither party filed
exceptions.
