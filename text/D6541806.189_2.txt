4. On September 17, 2015, the Board issued an Order Terminating Probationary
Condition A. of Consent Order, which terminated the restriction on the Respondent’s
ability to prescribe opioids.

COMPLAINT

5. On or about January 4, 2019, the Board received a complaint alleging that the
Respondent was prescribing high dosages of opioids to cash-paying patients, many of
whom had criminal histories relating to CDS or had previously received or were currently

receiving opioid dependence treatment. The complaint further alleged that many of the

Respondent’s patients were receiving 90 MME/day™ or more and that many of the

patients lived together or were friends on Facebook.

6. Based on the complaint, the Board began an investigation.
INVESTIGATION
7. In furtherance of the investigation, the Board issued a subpoena to the Prescription

Drug Monitoring Program (“PDMP”), for the period beginning on June 21, 2017 until
January 31, 2019, and obtained and reviewed the Respondent’s prescriptions including
those for CDS for twenty (20) patients. The information obtained revealed that the
Respondent had written over 7,300 new prescriptions for CDS between June 21, 2017
and January 31, 2019 and had prescribed opioids to approximately 190 different patients

since November 1, 2018.

, MME stands for Morphine Milligram Equivalents and is used to measure the daily intake of opioids for
patients. The CDC cautions against prescribing 90 MME/day or more.
