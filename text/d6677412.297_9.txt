Dr. Williams takes exception to the ALJ’s finding that he committed a sexual violation
against Patient 2 by putting his finger a quarter of the way inside her anus on August 18, 2014.
Dr. Williams testified that he performed an exam on the sacroiliac joint and the coccyx and, in
doing so, palpated at the very top of the gluteal cleft, but was adamant that he did not insert his
finger into Patient 2’s anus. Dr. Williams argues that there is no way he could have stuck a finger
in her anus without her bending over given her large size. The ALJ found Dr. Williams’s attacks
on Patient 2’s credibility to be “meritless.” The ALJ noted that Patient 2 was emotional when
testifying and exhibited “considerable distress.” It was clear to the ALJ that Patient 2 did not
wish to be at an administrative hearing testifying against Dr. Williams and the ALJ found that
the tears Patient 2 shed while testifying were genuine. The Panel adopts the ALJ’s credibility
determinations regarding Patient 2. The record reflects that there was no documented medical
reason for Dr. Williams to place his finger inside Patient 2’s anus.

The Panel finds that Dr. Williams committed a sexual violation as to Patient 2 and,
therefore, is guilty of immoral and unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in
violation of Health Occ. §14-404(a)(3). Dr. Williams’s exceptions with respect to Patient 2 are
denied.

Patient 3

Patient 3 has two medical conditions, Amold-Chiria Type 2 malformation and
degenerated cervical discs, which cause her to experience constant and severe back pain. The
patient’s pain is so severe that she requires an intrathecal pump implanted under the skin in her
abdomen to supply pain medication to her 24 hours per day. On December 16, 2013, Patient 3
saw Dr. Williams for a regular follow-up visit to obtain a refill of her intrathecal pump. During

that visit, Patient 3 informed Dr. Williams that she was in more pain than usual and that her pain
