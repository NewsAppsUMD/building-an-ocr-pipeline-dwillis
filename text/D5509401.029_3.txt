Association guidelines on self-prescribing. The Respondent further stated that he does
“not suffer from any addictions or engage in the habitual use of any controlled
dangerous substance, and am not otherwise habitually intoxicated.”

10. Pursuant to its investigation, the Board obtained the Respondent's
medical records from two physicians whom the Respondent identified as his treating
physicians.

11... The Board also issued a subpoena to the Prescription Drug Monitoring
Program (“PDMP’”), reviewed the Respondent's medication profiles from various area
pharmacies, and obtained his pharmacy records and prescriptions for controlled
dangerous substances for the period beginning on January 1, 2016 until July 11, 2018.
The information obtained revealed that since 2008, in addition to medications
prescribed by his treating providers, the Respondent self-prescribed benzodiazepines
on numerous occasions, normally authorizing four refills per new prescription written.
Also, the two physicians the Respondent employed at the Practice (Physician A and
Physician B, respectively) intermittently wrote benzodiazepine prescriptions for him.
Physician A prescribed for the Respondent from approximately mid-2007 to early-2016
while Physician B prescribed for the Respondent from approximately mid-2012 to mid-
2014. The Respondent did not maintain a medical record while self-prescribing nor did
the Practice maintain medical records for the prescribing that practitioners there

provided for him.
