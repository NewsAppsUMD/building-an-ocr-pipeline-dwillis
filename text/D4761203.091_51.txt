11. The placement of Ethibond sutures requires patients to return for a second surgery
to have the Ethibond sutures removed. That second surgery requires preparation, anesthesia, the
placement of an additional absorbable suture, and some recovery time. Removal of Ethibond
sutures does not require general anesthesia, but does require the patient be sedated beyond local
anesthesia. The patient must be cleared medically prior to being sedated for removal of the
Ethibond sutures. Once the patient is sedated, the suture removal procedure typically lasts less

than ten minutes.

12, The placement of Vicryl or other absorbable sutures does not require a second
procedure.

13, If the sutures are not in place long enough, if they fail, or if they fail to heal the
vaginal cuff appropriately, a complication called vaginal cuff dehiscence (VCD) can occur.
When VCD occurs the contents ofthe body cavity enter the vagina. In some cases, the contents
exit the vagina opening and go outside the body. Common causes of VCD are sexual intercourse
or straining to go to the bathroom.

14.. VCD is an uncommon complication. However, it is serious, expensive,

- complicated to treat and presents a risk of mortality to the patient. Incidents of vcD at the
Respondent’s practice are rare.

15. Prior to October of 2013, the Respondent primarily used Vicryl when suturing the
vaginal cuff. At the time, the Respondent and Dr. Danilyants performed approximately 500 to
600 hysterectomies per year. On one occasion, a patient of Dr. Danilyants experienced VCD,
which caused her bowels to exit her body through her vagina. Dr. Danilyants had sutured that
patient’s vaginal cuff with Vicryl.

16. . In October of 2013, the Respondent commenced prospective research to
determine whether Ethibond sutures, which remained in the body longer than Vicryl, decreased
