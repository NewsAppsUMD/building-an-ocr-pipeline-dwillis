 

14. The Respondent acknowledged during the interview that the “standard
procedure” would have been to “pull and ET tube and bag mask” if there was trouble
ventilating and the anesthesia team was not present to replace the ETT. The Respondent
also acknowledged that he had operated outside the scope of practice for a respiratory care
practitioner by creating and applying the device to the Patient.

15. On or about July 31, 2019, the Board requested a peer review of the
Respondent’s actions from a Professor of Respiratory Therapy at a Maryland college, who
is also licensed by the Board to practice as a respiratory care practitioner in Maryland (the
“Peer Reviewer”).

16. Onor about August 26, 2019, the Peer Reviewer provided the Board with his
report. The Peer Reviewer explained that the standard of care when presented with a
patient with a compromised ETT is to “extubate the patient and manually ventilate the
patient with 100% oxygen via a bag/mask device until anesthesia arrived to assist with the
airway.” The Peer Reviewer also stated that the scope of practice for a respiratory care
practitioner “does not provide for designing and/or applying unapproved medical
devices[.]” Accordingly, the Peer Reviewer concluded that the Respondent:

¢ Failed to meet appropriate standards for the delivery of respiratory
care performed in the State of Maryland;

e Practiced or attempted to practice beyond the authorized scope of
practice for a respiratory care practitioner; and

e Is guilty of unprofessional or immoral conduct in the practice of
respiratory care.

° Specifically, the Board requested that the Peer Reviewer review case records provide an opinion
about whether the Respondent violated any provisions of Health Occ. § 14-5A-17(a).
