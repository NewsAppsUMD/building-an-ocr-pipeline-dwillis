deaths including a complaint filed by Patient A’s mother whose son was one of the two patients who
died while under the medical care of the Respondent. (State’s Ex. #6). Joshua Schafer, Compliance
Analyst for the Board, requested both doctors provide a report following their review of the documents
submitted with the request. (State’s Ex. #29). On March 24, 2014, Dr. Kombluth submitted his peer
review report. (State’s Ex. #30). On May 30, 2014, Dr. Wright submitted her peer review report.

As previously stated, Dr. Wright, who is Board certified in anesthesiology and pain
medicine was admitted as an expert in pain medicine. Dr. Wright, as the Medical Director of the
Pain Management Center at the University of Maryland, devotes her practice exclusively to chronic
care pain management patients.

Dr. Kornbluth is ABPMR Pain Management Board Certified. He has been a founder and
partner in pain management practices since 2004. He has hospital privileges at the Carroll County
Medical Center and Franklin Square Medical Center.

By contrast to the breadth of experience of both Drs. Wright and Kornbluth, the Respondent,
who has practiced medicine for 46 years, has 19 hours of pain management training, is not Board
certified in pain medicine and currently has no hospital privileges in the State of Maryland. His
pain management practice essentially began when he started working for XpressMedCare in
February 2012. When asked whether he had any objections to Dr. Wright being designated as an
expert in pain medicine, the Respondent had none whatsoever. He stated that he was honored that

Dr. Wright has taken the time to read his patient charts, Tr. 34.
