likely that these fields were blank on the original records or were overridden with the most recent
information and were identically auto-filled by the Electronic Medical Records with the new
information when the records were printed in response to the Board’s subpoena. See State Gov’t
§ 10-213(i) (The agency . . . may use its experience, technical competence and specialized
knowledge in the evaluation of evidence.”)

The July 21, 2016 visit with Dr. Hardi that described his plan as “MRI Abdomen/Pelvis
with and w/o contrast” and “Bun/Creatinine” laboratory tests for Individual A, is substantiated
by evidence other than this one medical record. The patient’s records indicate that Dr. Hardi
ordered an MRI on other practice documents. (State Ex. A2 p. 5). The laboratory lists Dr. Hardi
as the Ordering Physician on a specimen from July 22, 2016. (State Ex. A2, p. 58). The lab
report shows that Dr. Hardi reviewed and signed the lab results on July 25, 2016. Id. The
radiologist report from August 2, 2016 lists Dr. Hardi as the requesting physician and states that
it was signed by Dr. Hardi on August 11, 2016. Individual A also substantiated the treatment,
testifying that she received medical care from Dr. Hardi during the period they were having a
sexual relationship.

DR. HARDI’S EXCEPTIONS — INDIVIDUAL A

In his exceptions, Dr. Hardi admits that Individual A was a patient prior to their sexual
relationship and admits that Individual A was a patient after the sexual relationship terminated
but claims that she was not a patient during their sexual relationship. Dr. Hardi bases this on the
ALI’s factual finding that the July 21, 2016 record was altered because it mentioned a procedure
that had not yet occurred.’ Dr, Hardi claims that because that record was altered, the visit never

occurred, and the other electronic medical records should also not be relied upon. He further
