The Respondent was Patient A’s primary care physician.

At the outset of Patient A’s examination, the Respondent was calm and cordial
towards S.W. as he-took down Patient A’s history. .

‘When it was time to conduct the physical examination of Patient A, the Respondent
asked S.W. if they could move to the larger exam. room and she agreed. Once they
were set up in the second room and the Respondent began the physical examination
of Patient A, the Respondent asked S.W. if she had heard about the December 2, 2015
shooting attack in San Bernardino, California, in which. a married pair of perpetrators, ,
rumored to be radical followers of Islam, opened fire on visitors and workers at the
Inland Regional Center, killing fourteen people and wounding twenty-two others.
When S.W. responded she had not heard about the San Bemardino attack, the
Respondent’s demeanor towards her changed. He became agitated and raised his
voice, and repeatedly asked her if she denounced the attack, or, alternatively, if she
supported the attackers’ actions. He remarked about the female attacker wearing a
burga and told S.W. the attackers were “doing jihad in the name of Allah.” (State Ex.
4, p.3.) S.W. tried to tell the Respondent that the attackers’ actions were not
representative of the teachings of Islam, but the Respondent talked over her, advising
her that murder is illegal in the United States, iterating “there will be no jihad in this
office” multiple times, and criticizing her for “daring” to wear a burqa to his office.
Although S.W. made efforts to placate the Respondent, hé continued to argue with .
her about the attackers, jihad in the name of Islam, and her wearing a burga. S.W.
asked the Respondent if he was finished examining Patient A. When the Respondent
did not answer, but continued his tirade, S.W. stepped into the hallway outside the
examination room to call her supervisor ae: advice on, how to proceed.
