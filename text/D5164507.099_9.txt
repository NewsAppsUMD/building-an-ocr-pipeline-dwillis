“conduct unbecoming a member of good standing of a profession.” Finucan, 380 Md. at 594.
The Panel does not adopt the ALJ’s determination that his sexual relationship was independent
of his involvement with Patient 1. Panel B finds that Dr. Johnson is guilty of unprofessional
conduct in the practice of medicine based on the sexual relationship and other boundary
violations. See Finucan, Salerian, and the Principles of Ethics.

Disclosure of Confidential Information

The other major instance of unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine was Dr.
Johnson’s disclosure of confidential medical information and discussion of other patients in his
therapy sessions. Dr. Johnson disclosed Patient 2°s diagnosis in front of Person 1 and told
Person 1 and Patient 1 that Patient 2 would frequently request a change in her medication during
therapy sessions. Dr. Johnson described another patient as “retarded” and said that he felt sorry
for that patient. Panel B agrees with the ALJ that “the doctor-patient relationship [should] be
maintained in the strictest confidence to allow the patient to allow for trust in the relationship,
the linchpin of the therapeutic relationship.” These disclosures violated the Principles of Ethics
by breaching confidentiality of psychiatric therapy, without the necessary sensitivity to the
private nature of disclosures by patients and without considering “[t]he welfare of his patients.”
Principles of Ethics § 4, 4.1; see Salerian, 176 Md. App. at 249 (patients “should be ‘assured that
information divulged to the psychiatrist ... . will be held in utmost confidence.’”). Panel B finds
that Dr. Johnson’s disclosures of confidential medical information constitute unprofessional
conduct in the practice of medicine.
