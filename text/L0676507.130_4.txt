ORDER TERMINATING SUSPENSION AND IMPOSING PROBATION

On June 13, 2017, the Maryland State Board of Physicians (“Board”) and the Respondent,
Michael Nero, R.C.P, entered into a Disposition Agreement, which required that he enroll in the
Maryland Professional Rehabilitation Program (“MPRP”). Mr. Nero agreed to comply with all of
MPRP’s recommendations and agreed to fulfill all conditions of the Participant Rehabilitation
Agreement that he signed with MPRP on June 26, 2017. On multiple occasions in 2018, MPRP
reported to the Board that Mr. Nero had failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the
Participant Rehabilitation Agreement. On November 18, 2018, Disciplinary Panel A (“Panel A”)
of the Board issued a Violation of Board Order and Notice to Show Cause regarding Mr. Nero’s
alleged violations of his Disposition Agreement. Panel A held a show cause hearing on
December 5, 2018, during which Mr. Nero admitted his violations.

On December 21, 2018, Panel A received another report from MPRP that Mr. Nero had again
failed to comply with his Rehabilitation Agreement. On December 31, 2018, the panel received a
written acknowledgement of his failure to comply from Mr. Nero. On March 27, 2019, Panel A
issued a second Violation of Board Order and Notice to Show Cause and held another show
cause hearing on May 8, 2019 at which Mr. Nero had the opportunity to argue why his license

should not be subject to further discipline.
