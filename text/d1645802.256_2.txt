Disciplinary Panel B (‘Panel B”) for an oral exceptions hearing.?

FINDINGS OF FACT

Panel B adopts the facts stipulated to by the parties and the ALJ’s proposed findings of
fact. numbers 1-111. See ALJ proposed decision, attached as Exhibit A. These facts are
incorporated by reference into the body of this document as if set forth in full, with the
modifications set forth below, pursuant to Panel B’s authority under Section 10-216(b) of the
State Government Article. Dr. Dooley does not specifically challenge any of the ALJ’s
proposed findings of fact in his exceptions, thus the facts are largely undisputed. The factual
findings were proved by a preponderance of the evidence.

Panel B also adopts the ALJ’s discussion set forth on pages 23-42 of the proposed

decision, with the modifications below.°

> Dr, Dooley was represented by counsel at the exceptions stage of the proceedings.

* On page 12, Panel B modifies finding of fact 25 to reflect that Patient A was initially seen by the nurse
practitioner, not Dr. Dooley, and finding of fact 26 to reflect that the x-rays were ordered on October 29, 2012. On
page 16, Panel B does not adopt finding of fact 55 and modifies the language in finding of fact 58 to reflect that the
prescribing information from Patient D’s previous physician was documented in a letter from two years prior, dated
April 12, 2011. On page 17, Panel B modifies finding of fact 59 to reflect that Patient D was referred for emergency
surgery on April 23, 2013, corrects the dosage information in finding of fact 62 to 30 mg of Oxycodone and 80 mg
of Oxycontin, and modifies the months listed in finding of fact 63 to April, June, and July 2013. On page 18 in
finding of fact 68, the Panel clarifies that Patient E was referred for chiropractic treatment and initially prescribed
Oxycodone by other practitioners at XpressMedCare, as Patient E was first seen by Dr. Dooley on October 3, 2012.
Panel B modifies the date in finding of fact 71 to April 25, 2013 based on what is documented in the medical records
and clarifies in finding of fact 72 that Patient E saw Dr. Sani, another doctor at XpressMedCare, on May 17, 2013.
Panel B changes the date in findings of fact 91 and 92 to January 28, 2013 to match what is reflected in the medical
records,

> On page 25, Panel B modifies footnote 5 to reflect that the State has the burden of proving the standard of care.

appointment with Dr. Dooley was on October 23, 2012. On page 32, Panel B modifies the months that Patient D
received early prescription refills to April, June, and July of 2013. On page 33, Panel B clarifies that Patient E was
not seen by Dr. Dooley on May 17, 2013.
