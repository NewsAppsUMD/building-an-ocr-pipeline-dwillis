FINDINGS OF FACT

1. At all times relevant hereto, the Respondent was and is licensed to practice

radiography in the State of Maryland. The Respondent originally was licensed to practice
radiography in Maryland on November 20, 2009, under License Number R09509. The
Respondent’s license is current through April 30, 2023.

2. On January 12, 2021, in Case No. 2221-0002 B, the Respondent entered into
a public Consent Order with Panel B, concluding that the Respondent failed to disclose a
2017 driving under the influence arrest and subsequent probation before judgment
disposition on her 2017 and 2019 radiography license renewals. Panel B concluded as a
matter of law that the Respondent “fraudulently or deceptively obtained or attempted to
obtain a license in violation of Health Occ. § 14-SB-14(a)(1); is guilty of unprofessional
conduct in the practice of radiation therapy, radiography, nuclear medicine technology, or
radiology assistance, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-5B-14(a)(3); and willfully made or
filed a false report or record in the practice of radiation therapy, radiography, nuclear
medicine technology, or radiology assistance, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-5B-
14(a)(10).” Pursuant to the Consent Order, Panel B placed the Respondent on probation
for a minimum of one year, required her to take a course in professional ethics, and pay a

$1,000.00 fine.
