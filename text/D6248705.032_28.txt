CONSIDERATION OF PETITION
A. Multi-Phase Forensic Assessments

Based on MPRP’s referral of Dr. Schnitzlein to a professional coaching and educational
program, Dr. Schnitzlein participated in coaching encounters, completed various phases of the
program via a telemedicine platform beginning in September, 2020, and was scheduled for a final
phase on October 6-8, 2021. A fitness to practice evaluation dated October 1, 2020 did not find
that Dr, Schnitzlein had any memory or cognitive deficits but found that he distanced himself from
his misconduct and tried to “mitigate his culpability.” The program’s evaluating team concluded
that he was unsafe to practice medicine unless he received treatment for a health condition. A
Summary Report included observations that: Dr. Schnitzlein lacked psychic integration and the
perceptual insight expected of a psychiatrist and that health factors that may have predisposed him
to engage in such unprofessional, unethical conduct did not excuse his conduct. Reports from
subsequent evaluations in 2020 and 2021 concluded that a severe health condition! was the likely
cause of Dr. Schnitzlein’s unprofessional conduct and specified the need for Dr. Schnitzlein to
engage in ongoing treatment for his condition, and develop skills to remain accountable to the
professional-ethical role of being a physician.

In terms of a return to practice, the evaluating team recommended any of the following: a
male only practice - in-person and telepsychiatry, a prison or jail setting with chaperone, a clinic
setting with a workplace oversight monitor and polygraphs every 3-6 months, or practice with a

psychiatric nurse practitioner and chaperone for female patients and polygraphs every 3-6 months.

' The details of the health condition are not disclosed in this document.
