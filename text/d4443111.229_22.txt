the Respondent "said the only disagreement he had with Patient C's version of the facts was that
he did not cup her breast, although he may have inadvertently touched her breast." (ALJ's proposed
decision at 32.) But, the Respondent's testimony, memorialized on page 263 of the hearing
transcript, is misstated by both the Respondent and the ALJ. The transcript states:

Q. And according to your interview in 2010, where you said
“accidentally, yes, because | was in that area,"!! you agree with
Patient C that, at some point, your hand came into contact with
Patient C's breast.

[Respondent's] A. 1 did, but 1 did not do the cupping.

Q. Okay. So where you disagree with Patient C is that -- that
whether or not you cupped her breast; is that correct?

A. That's correct.
The Respondent, here, indicates that his hand did come into contact with Patient C’s breast.

The Respondent also takes exception to the ALJ's finding that the Respondent's testimony
was inconsistent. The Respondent's testimony was inconsistent on two subjects with respect to
Patient C. First, the Respondent testified that he (a) touched her breast. (T. 263; State's Ex. 15, T.
33.) But the Respondent also testified that he (b) may have accidentally touched her breast. (State's

Ex. 15, T. 34.) Second, the Respondent (a) refused to acknowledge that he looked underneath her

° During the Respondent's interview in 2010 with the Board's investigators, the Respondent
testified as follows:

Q, Okay. All right. So when you did that, did you happen, by
any chance, recall if you actually went under the underwire bra line.
went in that area at all?

A. What can | tell you. On purpose. I never intentionally touched
her breast.

Q. Um-hmm.

A. Accidentally, yes, because 1 was in that area.

Q. Okay.

A. Yeah, The side of the breast, yes.
