but there are only three forms with test results. Each time a SPT is performed there should be
documentation of allergens tested, the results for each allergen tested, and the date the test was
performed. One form has two dates on it: 4/15/14 and 4/18/14. Each page has one signature of
the Respondent. It is unclear when the Respondent completed this form. That should have been
clear. His documentation of SPTs was substandard.

The Respondent billed for four SPTs for Patient 5 purportedly performed on April 15,
2014; April 19, 2014, May 1, 2014, and May 13, 2014. The Respondent billed for the testing of
264 allergens with each of these SPTs. Each SPT should be documented with each of the
allergens tested, the results, and the date of the test. The records, however, contain only three
forms with SPT results. One results form pertains to April 15, 2014 (“poor histamine response”).
Another results form is dated April 19, 2014, and lists 96 allergens tested, although he billed for
264. The other results form is dated “4/15/14 — 5/29/15,” which were the dates of the first and
last of the six patient visits. This form does not distinguish the dates of any of the tests, and one
cannot discern when any of these allergens were tested. In addition, on May 1, 2014, the
Respondent billed $3000 for 300 patch tests, but there is no results form for the PT, which
should list the allergens tested, the results, the date of the test, and the date of the reading. The
Respondent only wrote “negative — (no reaction)” in the progress notes.

Based upon the findings described above, the Respondent failed to keep adequate
medical records as determined by appropriate peer review, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-
404(a)(40).

Summary of Conclusions of Law
As described above, the Respondent: is guilty of unprofessional conduct in the practice of

medicine, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii); grossly overutilized health care services,
