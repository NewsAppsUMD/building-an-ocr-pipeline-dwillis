a patient of his. client became a patient of [the Respondent] 6.5 years, became friends 4
years ago and intimate over the last year — through the 6.5 years he has been her treating
physician.”

13. A staff member employed by the Psychiatrist (the “Staff Member”) was
present while the Patient disclosed this information to the Psychiatrist. The Staff Member
documented in a December 29, 2020 medical record: “Pt states that she has been Dr.
Drackenberg’s pt for about 6 years and that a friendship started about 4 years ago. When
asked how long they have been intimate, the pt states it has been on and off for a year and
they just started up a few months ago in August. As MD interviews pt about this matter,
she becomes notably anxious and asks if this will stay between them....Pt appears
anxious...and states, ‘I wish I had never said anything’ noting she thinks it is ‘better’ if
someone else is prescribing her medication because she ‘does not like being on that much
medication.” Board staff on July 16, 2021 interviewed the Technician who confirmed that
the Patient stated she engaged in an intimate relationship with the Respondent and that the
Patient did not “think it was right.”

C. Interview of the Patient

14. As part of its investigation, Board staff interviewed the Patient under oath on
March 22, 2021.

15. During the interview, the Patient confirmed the Respondent treated her from
2014-2016 for severe psychiatric disorders. The Patient stated that from 2016 to mid-2017,
she did not see the Respondent in any capacity, until she randomly saw the Respondent at

a CVS Pharmacy.
