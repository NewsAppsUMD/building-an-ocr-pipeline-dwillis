DISPOSITION

It is uncontroverted that Dr. Halstead did not meet face-to-face with his peer supervisor
in seven of the ten monthly meetings he had with the peer supervisor. Dr. Halstead admitted this
at the Show Cause Hearing. This is a straight-forward violation of condition 1 of the October
2017 Order After Show Cause Hearing.

The peer supervisor also noted significant practice deficiencies. Of particular concern to
the Panel are those deficiencies pertaining to Dr. Halstead’s physical examinations and
differential diagnoses, two cornerstones of internal medical practice. Physician A’s report stated
“the PE [physical examination] was not always appropriate in scope given type of visit and
nature of the presenting problem.” The supervisor also noted significant concerns about Dr.
Halstead’s differential diagnostic assessments. The supervisor noted that, in many cases, “Dr.
Halstead did not order tests and diagnostic studies when they were needed” and, when they were
performed, the documented findings were “insufficient to support the diagnosis” and “did not
consistently note a diagnosis for each acute problem or condition.” The supervisor characterized
Dr. Halstead’s clinical reasoning as “haphazard and not always justifiable with other information
on the notes.”

At the show cause hearing, Dr. Halstead admitted that his current deficiencies include
physical examinations and differential diagnoses. Dr. Halstead also admitted that at the time of
the reports his practice “probably needed a lot of improvement” but argued that his current
records are better than they were during the review periods. Dr. Halstead stated that he would be
willing to take courses to remedy “those . . . deficiencies, eliminate those and bring [him]self up

to speed.”
