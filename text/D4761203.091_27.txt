letter related to Dr. MacKoul’s study comparing Ethibond to Vicryl sutures.'* Dr. Shamoo
observed that the Integ Review IRB exemption dated April 27, 2018 (Resp. Exh. 32), was granted
in 2018 after the data reviewed by the IRB was already obtained, accumulated and in existence. In
Dr. Shamoo’s opinion, the 2018 IRB did not grant permission and exemption for the Ethibond
versus Vicryl comparison process started in 2013 and had nothing to do with approval of the
process throughout the 2013-2016 three-year period. The Panel agrees with Dr. Shamoo. The 2018
IRB exemption letter does not include an attached protocol and does not indicate that the IRB
reviewed the Ethibond data that Dr. MacKoul collected from 2013-2016.

In his exceptions, Dr. MacKoul argues that the ALJ and Dr. Shamoo did not give any
deference to the approval that Dr. MacKoul received from Integ Review IRB for his retrospective
study. He further argues that the study was solely for the purpose of quality improvement and
therefore exempt until he decided to publish the results. /d. In addition, Dr. MacKoul argues that
the ALJ mistakenly relied on Dr. Shamoo’s opinion that an intent to publish transformed Dr.
MacKoul’s study from a quality improvement study into a prospective research project. Dr.
Shamoo, however, considered not only Dr. MacKoul’s plan to systematically gather data over
three years and perform statistically significant analyses, but the totality of Dr. MacKoul’s actions.

Dr. Shamoo noted Dr. MacKoul’s overriding goal of comparing a nonabsorbable suture to an

 

'8 In his exceptions, Dr. MacKoul states that the IRB approved his study in 2017. MacKoul Exceptions, p. 10. The
Accepted Manuscript presented by Dr. MacKoul at the evidentiary hearing also shows an IRB date of 11/2017. The
title of the document is: “A Retrospective Review of Vaginal Cuff Dehiscence: Comparing Absorbable to
Nonabsorbable Sutures.” (Resp. Exh. 16) It was undisputed that the title of the study exempted by the IRB was “Patient
Characteristics and Surgical Outcomes of Minimally Invasive Gynecologic Surgery in an Ambulatory Surgery
Center,” and that the Integ Review IRB letter exempting Dr. MacKoul’s study noted that the research is not FDA-
regulated and was dated April 27, 2018. (Resp. Exh. 32) Dr. MacKoul’s research director - Dr. Van der Does - agreed
that the IRB approval letter had a different name for the exempted study but stated that it related to Dr. MacKoul’s
retrospective Ethibond study. She also testified that the study took place from October 2013 to April, 2018 and was
unable to explain why the IRB date was 11/2017. (Tr. 672-73) Dr. van der Does also acknowledged that surgical
sutures are FDA-regulated and did not know why the IRB letter stated that the research was not FDA-regulated. (Tr.
680)
