11. A review of the prescriptions also revealed that the Respondent prescribed
Adderall to a family member on four occasions between February 28, 2019 and April 25,
2020. The Respondent also prescribed Adderall to an individual who lived in the same
building as the Respondent on three occasions between March 15, 2019 and July 15, 2019.
Finally, the Respondent prescribed Adderall to Individual A living in Tennessee on March
30, 2020.

12. As part of its investigation, the Board obtained the Respondent’s medical
record from her former primary care physician (“Physician A”). A review of the record
showed that Physician A had diagnosed the Respondent with ADD and was prescribing
Adderall to her. The medical record further revealed that on or about October 9, 2019,
Physician A notified the Respondent that she could no longer prescribe Adderall to the
Respondent because she discovered that the Respondent had self-prescribed Adderall on
two occasions. On or about October 18, 2019, Physician A notified the Respondent that
she was discharging the Respondent as a patient due to the Respondent’s self-prescribing.

13. On or about June 22, 2020, the Board issued a subpoena to the Respondent
compelling her to produce a complete copy of Individual A’s medical record within ten
business days. The Respondent failed to produce Individual A’s medical record within ten

business days or any time thereafter.
