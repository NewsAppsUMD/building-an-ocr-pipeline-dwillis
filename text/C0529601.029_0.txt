Re: Surrender of License to Practice Medicine
Tasha M. Anderson, PA-C

License Number: C05296

Case Numbers: 2218-0243 and 7718-0066

Dear Dr. Freas and Members of Disciplinary Panel B:

Please be advised that, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. (“Health Occ.”)
§15-312 (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2017 Supp.), I have decided to SURRENDER my license to
practice as a physician assistant in the State of Maryland, License Number C05296,
effective immediately. I understand that upon surrender of my license, I may not give
medical advice or treatment to any individual, with or without compensation, and cannot
prescribe medications or otherwise engage in the practice of medicine in the State of
Maryland as it is defined in the Maryland Physician Assistants Act (the “Act’’), Health Occ.
§§ 15-101 et seg. and other applicable laws. In other words, as of the effective date of this
Letter of Surrender, I understand that the surrender of my license means that I am in the
same position as an unlicensed individual in the State of Maryland.

I understand that this Letter of Surrender is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT, and upon
Disciplinary Panel B’s (“Panel B”) acceptance, becomes a FINAL ORDER of Panel B of
the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”).

I acknowledge that the Board initiated an investigation of my practice and on
October 16, 2017, Panel B issued charges entitled, Violation of Order Terminating
Suspension and Imposing Probation and Charges Under the Maryland Physician
Assistants Act, alleging that I violated the terms of a previous Board Order by failing to
comply with the requirements of the Maryland Professional Rehabilitation Program
(MPRP). I resolved these disciplinary charges through entering into a Consent Order with
Panel B, dated December 14, 2017 (the “Consent Order”), in which Panel B found that I
violated Health Occ. § 15-314(a)(3)(@i) (unprofessional conduct in the practice of
medicine) and the terms and conditions of my probation. The Consent Order suspended
my license to practice medicine for a minimum six (6) months and required that I remain
enrolled in MPRP and abide by its referrals, rules, and requirements. A copy of the Consent
Order is attached and incorporated herein as Attachment 1.
