Proposed Sanction

The State recommends that the Respondent's license be revoked. In support of that
recommended sanction, the State argued that the purpose of the sanction in cases before the Board is
two-fold. First, it serves as a prophylactic against further similar action by the Respondent. Second,

practice of medicine in connection with assisted suicide is unconscionable and will result in the

revocation of one’s medical license.

COMAR 10.32.02.10 and .11 announce the specific sanctions the Board may levy against a
physician found in violation of section 14-404 of the Health Occupations Article. Among other

determining the appropriate. sanction for unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine.
Among those aggravating factors is whether “[t]he offense had the potential for or actually did

cause patient harm.”

harm to his patients, but it resulted in many of his patients’ deaths. I agree with the State that it has a
vested interest in making it clear that it will not abide physicians who use their medical practice and
expertise for the purpose of ending human life.

undertaken the actions that the Respondent undertook as Medical Director for the FEN; the fact
remains, however, that the Respondent took these actions as a physician — performing traditionally

physician-related tasks. The Board has a strong interest in preventing behavior such as the
