third violation of her Rehabilitation Agreement in her September 2022 communications with
MPRP. Since 2017, Dr. Andrews has been given multiple chances to prove to Panel A, by
undergoing rehabilitation with MPRP, that she was earnestly committed to her recovery. She failed
to do so.

While Panel A commends Dr. Andrews for her renewed recovery efforts since her
violation, Panel A is not confident that she has taken sufficient steps to mitigate the stressors that
led to her violation based on the evidence presented by the parties at the show cause hearing and
the nature of her violation. Nor is the panel reassured that she can properly address her own
reparative needs and adhere to MPRP’s requirements without a respite from exposure to the
pressures of providing critical patient care. Neither the public nor the medical profession would be
served if the Board ignores the objective of facilitating a meaningful recovery in Dr. Andrews’s
case. Accordingly, a suspension of her medical license followed by a probationary period is
necessary and geared primarily to Dr. Andrews’s rehabilitation.
