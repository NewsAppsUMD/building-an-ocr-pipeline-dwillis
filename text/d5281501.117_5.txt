The Court of Appeals has established that the “illegal distribution of controlled dangerous
substances is a serious offense against society, and possession with intent to distribute is but a
short step removed from that in terms of culpability.” Attorney Grievance Comm'n of Maryland
v. Proctor, 309 Md. 412, 418 (1987). The Court “conclude[d] that although conduct in violation
of this section will ordinarily involve moral turpitude, each case must be decided on its own
facts.” Id. at 419.

In Attorney Grievance Comm’n of Maryland v. Marcalus, 414 Md. 501, 520 (2010), the
Court of Appeals cited Proctor for the proposition that violations of the Controlled Dangerous
Substances Act “will usually involve moral turpitude.” The Court recognized “the felonious
nature of this crime and intentional manner in which Marcalus acted” and determined that “there
is no reason to deviate from the hearing judge’s finding that this violation implicates Rule
8.4(b).” Jd. at 520-21. The underlying facts of the case involved the exchange of Vicodin, a
controlled dangerous substance, in exchange for the performance of a sexual act. The Court held
as follows: “We need not decide whether Marcalus’s sexual encounter with Michelle rises to the
level of ‘moral turpitude’ necessary to reach a violation under Rule 8.4(b) - Marcalus’s
distribution of Vicodin is sufficient on its own.” Jd. at 521.

The Board has determined in several cases that the illegal distribution and dispensing of
controlled dangerous substances are crimes of moral turpitude. In one case, the Board found that
the distribution of Dilaudid, a Schedule II controlled dangerous substance, was a crime of moral
turpitude because it violated medical ethics and “constitutes an act of depravity in the private and
social duties which the Respondent owed to society.” Jn the Matter of Mays, Case No. 94-0219.

Similarly, in In the Matter of Hicks, Case No. 2001-0208, the Board found that a physician’s
