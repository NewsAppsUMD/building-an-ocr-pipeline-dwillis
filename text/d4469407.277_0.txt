Dear Dr. Bailey and Counsel:

On July 17, 2017, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued
an ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE in
this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t II, § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl. Vol.). You
were given an opportunity to attend a postdeprivation hearing before Disciplinary Panel B to
show cause why that suspension should not be continued on July 26, 2017. You attended the
hearing on that date together with your counsel, Sigrid C. Haines, Esq. The State was represented
by Janet Brown, Assistant Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor. Both parties presented
oral arguments at the show cause hearing.

After considering these arguments at the hearing and the investigative file, Disciplinary
Panel B determined that it would continue the summary suspension imposed on July 17, 2017.
Disciplinary Panel B thus will not lift the summary suspension order. The arguments submitted,
when considered in the light of the investigative findings in the file, persuade Disciplinary Panel
