A. Nothing in this chapter prohibits the issuance of a charging document
with a proposed order which will go into effect if the respondent fails
to request a hearing.

FINDINGS OF FACT

 

Panel B finds the following:

1. At all times relevant hereto, the Respondent was and is licensed to practice
radiography in the State of Maryland. The Respondent was initially licensed to practice
radiography in Maryland on April 19, 1995, under License Number R04147. The
Respondent's license is active through April 30, 2019.

2. On or about April 25, 2017, the Respondent initiated the process of applying
for renewal of her radiography license for the 2017 renewal period using the Board's
online renewal application process. When a licensee applies online to renew his or her
license, a notice appears that informs the licensee that the Board may not renew a license
if it has not received the licensee's Criminal History Record Check ("CHRC") information,
which includes the licensee's submission of his or her fingerprints to the Criminal Justice
Information Services ("CJIS") before attempting to complete the renewal application.

3. The Respondent submitted her online application (the "Application") and the
required renewal fee on or about April 25, 2017. The Application states, "Failure to submit
to a [CHRC] may result in disciplinary action." When submitting her online Application,
the Respondent checked a box attesting that she completed her CHRC.

4. By email dated July 21, 2017, Board staff informed the Respondent that the
Board had not received the CHRC she had attested to completing prior to filing the
renewal application. Board staff further informed the Respondent that she had ten
business days to submit the CHRC. The Board did not receive a response from the

Respondent.
