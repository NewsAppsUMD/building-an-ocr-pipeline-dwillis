prescribed methylphenidate to Patient D in “a productive and safe way to maintain what his
[Patient D’s] psychiatrist refers to as the ‘highest cognitive functioning.’” The Respondent
acknowledged that he prescribed the medication for an “off-label” use.

Although the Respondent stated during his interview with Board staff that he had treated
Patient D since receiving his medical license, and had conceded that there were five years during
which time he had not documented notes for the medical care rendered to Patient D, Patient D’s
medical record only includes two pages of progress notes, dated January 30, 2014 through July
28, 2014.

The Respondent’s notes reflect monthly prescribing of methylphenidate 10 mg, 1 tablet
by mouth twice daily, #60. The Respondent failed to document a physical examination,
cognitive assessment, diagnosis, or treatment plan. The Respondent also failed to document vital
signs for Patient D, including monitoring for high blood pressure.

The Respondent provided Board staff with a list of eight physicians who purportedly saw
Patient D for medical care. He documented the medications that each physician prescribed for
Patient D; none prescribed methylphenidate for him.

The Respondent’s continued prescribing of methylphenidate to Patient D constitutes a
failure to meet the standard of quality medical care for Patient D, in violation of Health Occ. §
14-404(a)(22), by:

A. Failing to conduct an adequate physical assessment including a physical
examination and monitoring of vital signs including blood pressure;

B. Treating Patient D without an adequate assessment or diagnosis; and

Cc. Failing to develop an adequate treatment plan.
