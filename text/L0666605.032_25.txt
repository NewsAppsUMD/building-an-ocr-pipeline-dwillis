DISCUSSION

Burden of Proof

When not otherwise provided by statute or regulation, the standard of proof in a contested
case hearing before the OAH is a preponderance of the evidence, and the burden of proof rests
on the party making an assertion or a claim. Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-217 (2021);
COMAR 28.02.01.21K. To prove an assertion or a claim by a preponderance of the evidence
means to show that it is “more likely so than not so” when all the evidence is considered.
Coleman v, Anne Arundel Cty. Police Dep’t, 369 Md. 108, 125 n.16 (2002). The State bears the
burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the Respondent is guilty of the Charges.
COMAR 28,02.01.21K(1)-(2)(a).
