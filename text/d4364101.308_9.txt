Adderall 30 mg twice daily (#60) on the following dates without a corresponding medical note:
September 16, 2015, October 14, 2015, January 20, 2016, March 16, 2016, April 13, 2016, May
13, 2016 and July 6, 2016. Dr. Vaughn did not document any medical visits for Patient C prior
to August 10, 2016. He signed a certification of medical records attesting that he had provided
the Board with all of Patient C’s medical records in his possession. The only visits he had
documented post-dated all of the prescriptions he had issued to Patient C cited above.

During Dr. Vaughn’s January 26, 2017 interview with Board staff, he acknowledged that
he treated Patient C for ADD with Adderall 30 mg, twice daily and that, around June or July,
2016, while at Restaurant A, Dr. Vaughn wrote a prescription for Patient C for Adderall.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Panel B finds Dr. Vaughn in default based upon his failure to appear at the Office of
Administrative Hearings for the telephone prehearing conference scheduled for December 11,
2017. See State Gov’t § 10-210(4). Based upon the foregoing findings of fact, Panel B concludes
that Dr. Vaughn is guilty of unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation of
Health Occ. II § 14-404(a)(3)(ii), and that he sold, prescribed, gave away, or administered drugs
for illegal or illegitimate medical purposes, in violation of Health Occ. II § 14-404(a)(27).

SANCTION

Panel B adopts the sanction recommended by the ALJ, which is to revoke Dr. Vaughn’s

medical license.
ORDER
