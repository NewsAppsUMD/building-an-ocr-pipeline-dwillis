that the public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires the suspension of Dr. Joseph’s
license. See State Gov’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i). The order of summary suspension is thus reaffirmed
and continues. See COMAR 10.32.02.08H(1).

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, Dr. Joseph has the right to request a full evidentiary hearing
before an Administrative Law Judge at the Office of Administrative Hearings. To receive the
evidentiary hearing, Dr. Joseph or his counsel must file the request for the hearing within TEN
(10) days of the date of this letter. The request for a hearing should be sent to Christine Farrelly,
Executive Director, at the Board’s address. If the hearing is timely requested, the regulations
require that an Administrative Law Judge set the hearing to begin within 30 days of the request,
see COMAR 10.32.02.08I, though that 30-day time period may be waived.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel A resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely yours, ae

Signature on File

Ellen Douglas Smith, Deputy Director
Maryland State Board of Physicians
