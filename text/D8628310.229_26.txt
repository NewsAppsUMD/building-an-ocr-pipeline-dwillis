procedure visit. At this time, Respondent advised patient A.the procedure was “a success,” He

"identified the procedure as the TVAM procedure and indicated it was very similar to the CCSVI

procedure. Respondent provided patient A with a compact disc and a packet which contamed
information on stem cell therapy. Respondent then told patient A that many of his patients also _
opted to have stem cell therapy, in addition to the TVAM procedure, and the patients who did so
reported better outcomes.® Patient A was told that if she extended her stay one more day, she
could receive the stem cell treatment, and was quoted a price of ten thousand dollars ($10,000).
Patient A politely declined. Near the end of the visit, patient A was given directions to a
pharmacy that was fifteen to twenty minutes away, where she could obtain the medications
recommended by Respondent. When patient A arrived at the pharmacy, she received two to three
more calls from one of Respondent’s staff members, who attempted to persuade her to stay one
extra day for the stem cell therapy, with the staff member ultimately quoting a revised price of six
thousand dollars ($6,000). Once again, Patient A declined. :

completed on May 28, 2015, Patient’A was never advised of the results of this test and never
received any additional follow up from Respondent or any of his staff.

requesting payment in the amount of $16,174.39. After doing some additional investigation,

patient A obtained documentation indicating that Respondent billed $113,821.08 to Medicare and

6 In his interview before an HQIU investigator, Respondent stated “the stem cells may
have been presented as one of the treatments that we provide, but that is not something that I
offer” and “I think that the stem cell applications, um, are interesting and they — they have
potential, but it’s not something I'd say, ‘I think this is going to help you.’ It’s — yeah, it could.”
Patient A disputes Respondent’s claim that he.did not encourage her to undergo stem cell therapy
after having the TVAM procedure.
