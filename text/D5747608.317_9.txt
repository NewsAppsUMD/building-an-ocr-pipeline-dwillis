the marijuana police found there was “planted” by someone with an animus against her. Also,
when interviewed during her arrest, the Respondent stated that she did not know what marijuana
“looks or smells like.” Board investigators, however, found an on-line news article that
described the Respondent as a medical advisor for a group that was “hoping to get licensed to
grow medical cannabis.” In a video that accompanied the article, the Respondent stated that she
was involved in an ongoing project to grow cannabis with aeroponics and that she was focusing
on researching the use of cannabis in pain management. In addition, during her Board interview,
the Respondent addressed the numerous plants found in the master bedroom by stating that she
never went into the “bedroom where they do the grow.” Police reports, however, document that
the Respondent’s name was affixed to the door of the master bedroom and that she kept articles
of clothing, family photographs and packages addressed to her in the room.

The Respondent also provided several explanations for the CDS the police recovered.
For example, she stated that the oxycodone and morphine police recovered from her pocket
during the execution of the Warrant belonged to a friend who was traveling with the pill
containers. The Respondent stated that the Tramadol was prescribed for her dog, although she
stated to police that they were samples she no longer used in her practice. The Respondent also
stated that a patient gave her the Belladonna-Opium suppositories for her to destroy, which she
had forgotten to do. The Respondent also claimed that she possessed the Fentanyl containers
because she was “a big recycler repurposer.”
