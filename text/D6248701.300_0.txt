Case No.: 2219-0202B
License No.: D62487

Dear Dr. Schnitzlein, Ms. McSherry, and Mr. Malizio:

On January 14, 2020, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann.,
State Gov’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2019 Supp.).

Pursuant to the Order, on January 29, 2020, Disciplinary Panel B held a postdeprivation
hearing to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. Dr. Schnitzlein, and his
counsel, M. Natalie McSherry, Esq. attended the hearing on that date. The State was represented
by W. Adam Malizio, Assistant Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor. Dr. Schnitzlein
and his counsel did not contest the summary suspension at the postdeprivation hearing.

After considering the investigative file, Disciplinary Panel B determined that it would
continue the summary suspension imposed on January 14, 2020. Disciplinary Panel B thus will
not lift the summary suspension order. Disciplinary Panel B finds that the public health, safety or
welfare imperatively requires the suspension of Dr. Schnitzlein’s license. See State Gov’t, § 10-
