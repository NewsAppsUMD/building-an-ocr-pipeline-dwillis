The Respondent, who was wearing gloves, then used both of his hands to
separate Patient 4’s buttocks. He used his thumb to press and probe in between
Patient 4’s buttocks.

Patient 4 told the Respondent that other physicians had not touched her in that
area when giving an injection.

The Respondent responded that he was trying to get as close to the nerve as
possible and told Patient 4 to watch the bedside monitor while he injected her.
After injecting Patient 4, the Respondent placed a small bandage on the site of
the injection, in between her buttocks.

Patient 4 was disturbed that the Respondent had spread open her buttocks
before injecting her, but, at the time, believed that she did not have a basis to
question his conduct because she was not a doctor.

Patient 4 told her husband and daughter about the Respondent’s conduct as they
drove her home after the May 8 injection and a girlfriend (“Friend 1”) a short while
later.

On July 24, 2014, the Respondent administered a cervical injection to Patient 4.
During this procedure, Patient 4 was seen in the surgical center and wore a
surgical gown. The Respondent administered the injection in the presence of
surgical staff.

Patient 4 did not return to the Respondent after July 24, 2014.

On April 13, 2016, after learning about the Board’s action against the
Respondent, Patient 4 submitted a written complaint to the Board in which she

stated that she felt that the Respondent had “violated” her.
