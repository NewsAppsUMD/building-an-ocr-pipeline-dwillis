Patient 1’s first visit, on April 15, 2014, included a SPT which was uninterpretable
because the patient took an antihistamine before the visit. The Respondent billed $2640 for the
SPT. On the second visit, April 18, 2014, the Respondent did not perform a histamine test prior
to conducting another SPT, and the SPT was again uninterpretable, because the patient had taken
“cough medicine” before the visit. The Respondent billed $2640 for the SPT. On April 24,
2014, the Respondent performed another SPT without first testing for a histamine response. The
results of the test were “equivocal response to histamine.” The Respondent billed $2640 for the
SPT. On May 1, 2014, the Respondent performed another SPT, again without first testing for an
antihistamine, but this time, fortunately, there was a positive histamine response indicated from
the SPT, so the SPT was adequate. The Respondent billed $2640 for the SPT.° Both of the
State’s experts found that it was improper for the Respondent to conduct a SPT after the first
SPT was invalidated due to a negative histamine response without conducting a histamine test
prior to any subsequent SPT. The Respondent’s failure to do so resulted in two further
invalidated SPTs for which he billed a combined $5,280.

In addition to Patient 1, Patients 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10 also had negative histamine responses
on their initial SPTs. Based upon the number of patients with negative histamine responses, the
ALJ determined that the Respondent failed to notify his patients to stop taking antihistamines
prior to the visit. The ALJ did not accept the Respondent’s testimony that he did instruct his
patients to stop taking antihistamine before their visits. The Panel accepts the ALJ’s finding that

the Respondent did not instruct his patients to stop taking antihistamines before their visits.

> As described above, the Respondent again performed another SPT on May 10, 2016, billing for
$2640 for that STP, and billed $2640 for a SPT on March 24, 2016, although no visit occurred or
SPT actually occurred on that date.
