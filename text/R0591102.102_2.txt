Under OAH’s rules of procedure, “[i]f, after receiving proper notice in Regulation .05C
of this chapter, a party fails to attend or participate, either personally or through a representative,
in a prehearing conference, hearing, or other stage of a proceeding, the ALJ may proceed in that
party’s absence or may, in accordance with the hearing authority delegated by the agency, issue a
final or proposed default order against the defaulting party.” COMAR 28.02.01.23A. The
method of giving notice under regulation .05C includes notice “sent to the parties by United
States mail.” COMAR 28.02.01.05C.

On July 14, 2021, the ALJ issued a Proposed Default Order. The ALJ found that Mr.
Slate had proper notice of the July 6, 2021 prehearing conference and that he failed to attend or
participate in the prehearing conference without good cause. The ALJ proposed that the Panel
find Mr. Slate in default, adopt as findings of fact the statements set out in the allegations of fact
section of the charging document, conclude as a matter of law that Mr. Slate violated Health
Occ. § 14-5B-14(a)(3), (10), and (26) in the manner set forth in the charges, and recommended
as a sanction that Mr, Slate’s license be revoked.

Also, on July 14, 2021, the ALJ mailed copies of the Proposed Default Order to Mr.
Slate, the administrative prosecutor, and the Board at the parties’ respective addresses of record.
The Proposed Default Order notified the parties that they may file written exceptions to the
proposed order but must do so within 15 days of the date of the Proposed Default Order. The
Proposed Default Order stated that any exceptions and request for a hearing must be sent to the
Board with attention to the Board’s Executive Director. The Board sent further information
about filing exceptions on July 20, 2021. Mr. Slate did not file exceptions. On November 3,

2021, this case came before Disciplinary Panel A (“Panel A”) of the Board for final disposition.
