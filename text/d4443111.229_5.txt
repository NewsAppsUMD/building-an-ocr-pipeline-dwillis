this was taking place. The Respondent's sexual behavior, his touching and rubbing of Patient B
upper thigh, over her shorts, was sexually suggestive and was not for a medical purpose.

When Patient B left the Respondent's office that day, she cried in her sister's car and told
her sister about the Respondentâ€™s conduct. Patient B also told her mother that day.

Despite being uncomfortable, Patient B returned for further appointments with the
Respondent. Patient B testified that she returned to the Respondent because he was one of the
only allergists in the area that accepted her medical insurance. On these further visits with the
Respondent, Patient B made certain that her sister did not leave the room while she was being
examined by him.

The Board contacted Patient B as part of its investigation of the Respondent.

Patient C

Patient C became a patient of the Respondent on November 13, 2008, when she visited the
Respondent for allergy testing. She was 15 years old. She had seasonal allergic rhinoconjuntivitis
with postnasal drip.

On September 10, 2009, when Patient C was 16 years old, Patient C went to the
Respondent's office because she had chest pains and difficulty breathing while in gym class. The
Respondent performed spirometry to check for asthma, The Respondent, Patient C, and Patient
C's mother then went into the parking lot for an exercise test, which required Patient C to run for
several minutes. The Respondent, Patient C, and her mother then went into an examination room.
The Respondent again performed spirometry and then had Patient C lie on her side on an
examination table facing the back wall of the examination room. Patient C's mother was facing
Patient C's back on the other side of the room and could not see what the Respondent was doing

during the examination.
