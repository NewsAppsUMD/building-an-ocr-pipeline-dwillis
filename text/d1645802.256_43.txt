Patient B

Patient B’s first visit to XpressMedCare occurred on September 6, 2012. She was seen
by the Respondent, The reason for her visit was because she had been treated for two years for
lower back pain by Dr. Hampton Jackson. Dr. Jackson died and Patient B needed a new
prescription for oxycodone. The Respondent did not conduct any imaging studies or conduct a
physical examination because he was not going to accept Patient B into his practice. He referred
Patient B to Dr. Gharbani’s office, but was unsuccessful in speaking with him and setting up a
referral appointment with his office,

The Respondent, based solely on the representations of Patient B, prescribed oxycodone
for Patient B as a bridge prescription or a compassionate prescription to avoid the trauma of
withdrawal which could, if severe, potentially result in death. There is no evidence in the record
that the Respondent asked to see a bottle of the prescribed medication from Dr. Jackson or
otherwise verify the reported prescription before prescribing the same medication to Patient B.

On October 4, 2012, Patient B visited the Respondent for a follow-up visit. Once again,
the Patient was referred to Dr. Gharbani’s office for treatment of back pain. The Respondent did
not perform an examination of Patient B, The Respondent did not deem it necessary to perform
an examination since Patient B was not going to be accepted into his pain medicine treatment
program. Nevertheless, the Respondent provided Patient B with another prescription for
oxycodone but noted that it would be the last prescription he writes for her, No urine tests were
performed to determine whether Patient B was taking the medications as prescribed,

Finally, on December 7, 2012, Patient B visited the Respondent because she had
bronchitis. She was given an antibiotic for her bronchitis but was also given another prescription

for oxycodone. The Respondent did not verify that she ever followed through on the referral
