Case Number: 2219-0033B

Dear Dr. Freas and Members of Disciplinary Panel B,

Please be advised that, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. (“Health Occ.’’) §14-403
(2014 Repl. Vol. & 2019 Supp.), I have decided to PERMANENTLY SURRENDER my license
to practice medicine in the State of Maryland, License Number D05627, effective immediately. I
understand that upon surrender of my license, I may not give medical advice or treatment to any
individual, with or without compensation, and cannot prescribe medications or otherwise engage
in the practice of medicine in the State of Maryland as it is defined in the Maryland Medical
Practice Act (the “Act”), Health Occ. §§ 14-101 ef seq. and other applicable laws. In other words,
as of the effective date of this Permanent Letter of Surrender, I understand that the surrender of
my liccnse means that | am in the same position as an unlicensed individual in the State of
Maryland.

I understand that this Permanent Letter of Surrender is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT, and
upon Disciplinary Panel B’s (“Panel B”) acceptance, becomes a FINAL ORDER of Panel B of
the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board’’).

1 acknowledge that the Board received a complaint regarding my prescribing of controlled
dangerous substances, and initiated an investigation into the allegations. I have decided to
permanently surrender my license in the State of Maryland! to avoid further investigation and
prosecution of these allegations and due to my retirement. I recognize that for all purposes relevant
to medical licensure that these allegations shall be treated as proven and that these allegations
support a conclusion that I violated Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(22) and (40).

' Upon Panel B’s acceptance of this Permanent Letter of Surrender, | acknowledge that the Order for Summary
Suspension issued on October 16, 2019 and reaffirmed on October 31, 2019, is terminated as moot.
