The State filed exceptions to the ALJ’s proposed decision’s conclusions that aiding
patients in committing suicide was not the practice of medicine, arguing that the continuum of
Dr. Egbert’s conduct including reviewing the medical records, his participation in the suicide
rehearsal, his conduct during the suicides, and his conduct after the suicides, such as removing
the helium tanks and suicide paraphernalia, should be considered the practice of medicine.

B. Practice of Medicine in Statute and Caselaw

The Medical Practice Act, Health Occ. § 14-101(0) defines practicing medicine as
follows:

(1) “Practice medicine” means to engage, with or without compensation, in

medical:

(i) Diagnosis;
(ii) Healing;

(iii) Treatment; or
(iv) Surgery.

(2) “Practice medicine” includes doing, undertaking, professing to do, and
attempting any of the following:
(i) Diagnosing, healing, treating, preventing, prescribing for, or

removing any physical, mental, or emotional ailment or supposed ailment

of an individual:
1. By physical, mental, emotional, or other process that is

exercised or invoked by the practitioner, the patient, or both; or
2. By appliance, test, drug, operation, or treatment;
(ii) Ending of a human pregnancy; and
(iii) | Performing acupuncture as provided under § 14-504 of this title.
Maryland courts have not strictly interpreted the statutory definition of practicing
medicine, but rather have applied a broad interpretation of what is “in the practice of medicine”
under Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii). See Kim v. Maryland State Board of Physicians, 423 Md.
523, 527 (2011) (lying on a renewal application deemed in the practice of medicine); Finucan v.

Maryland Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance, 380 Md. 577, 597 (2004) (sexual relationship

with three patients deemed in the practice of medicine); Board of Physician Quality Assurance v.
