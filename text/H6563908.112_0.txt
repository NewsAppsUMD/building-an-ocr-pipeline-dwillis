Re: Jeffery J. Dormu, D.O.
Case No.: 2222-0014
License No.: H65639

Dear Dr. Dormu and Counsel:

On August 3, 2022, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2). On August 10,
2022, Dr. Dormu was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing before
Disciplinary Panel A to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. Dr. Dormu did
not attend the hearing and was represented by counsel, Kelly E. DuBois, Esquire. The State was
represented by Veronica Colson, Assistant Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor. Both
parties presented oral arguments at the post-deprivation hearing.

After consideration of the parties’ presentations, Disciplinary Panel A determined, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the health, safety, and welfare of the public imperatively
required the disciplinary panel to summarily suspend Dr. Dormu’s license and there exists a
substantial likelihood of risk of serious harm to the public health, safety, and welfare in Dr.
Dormu’s continued practice. Disciplinary Panel A thus will not lift the summary suspension
