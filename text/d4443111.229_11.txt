addition to the Respondent's statements regarding whether he accidentally touched Patient A's
breast(s), the Respondent made other statements that were inconsistent. lor the October 29, 2015,
visit, the Respondent wrote and signed an electronic medical record stating, in pertinent part:
O/E [On Examination]: ENT [Ear, Nose, and Throat]: TMs [Tympanic
Membranes]- clear, pale turbinates, clear secretions, mild pharyngeal
erythema, Sinus: no tenderness. RS: no wheezes. Chest-no tender on
palp. Cardiac: RSR, S1+, $2+, nonmurmurs.
(Emphasis added.) Consistent with this is the Respondent's written response, written with the
assistance counsel, which states, "While awaiting the patient's father to come to the room, [the
Respondent] performed a rapid ENT exam, chest palpation, and cardio-respiratory exam.‚Äù
(Emphasis added.) However, when providing oral testimony, the Respondent gave accounts of his
October 29, 2015, interaction with Patient A, which did not include mention ofan ENT evaluation.
(T. 208-12; Board interview, 10/26/16, T. 26-30.)

Also, in his interview with the Board investigators, the Respondent said that prior to, and
during, his examination of Patient A, on October 29, 2015, he explained to Patient A what he was
doing. (Interview Transcript at 28.) But, in his testimony before the ALJ, he testified that he was
so concerned about Patient A's reaction to the allergy shot that he could not take the time during
the examination to explain to Patient A what he was doing, (T. at 292.)

Based upon the Respondent's inconsistent statements and the ALJ's demeanor-based
credibility determination, the Panel does not find the Respondent's testimony credible with respect
to his interaction with Patient A on October 29, 2015.

The Panel does find Patient A credible for the reasons explained by the ALJ. Patient A's

statements were consistent, she reported the incident on the same day it oceurred, and she had an

emotional reaction upon leaving the Respondent's office.
