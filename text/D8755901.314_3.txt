agency, issue a final or proposed default order against the defaulting party.’ COMAR
28.02.01.23A.

On October 11, 2023, the ALJ issued a written Proposed Default Order. The ALJ found
that Dr. Farrag had proper notice of the October 2, 2023, prehearing conference and that he failed
to appear or participate. The ALJ proposed that the Panel find Dr. Farrag in default, adopt as
findings of fact the statements set forth in the allegations of fact section of the charges, and
conclude as a matter of law that Dr. Farrag violated Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(1), (3)(ii), and (36).
As a sanction, the ALJ proposed that Dr. Farrag’s license to practice medicine in Maryland be
revoked.

The ALJ mailed copies of the Proposed Default Order to Dr. Farrag, the administrative
prosecutor, and the Board at the parties’ respective addresses of record. The Proposed Default
Order notified the parties that they may file written exceptions to the proposed order but must do
so within 15 days of the date of the Proposed Default Order. The Proposed Default Order stated
that any exceptions and requests for a hearing must be sent to the Board with a copy provided to
the opposing party. The Proposed Default Order sent to Dr. Farrag was not returned to OAH as
undeliverable. On October 17, 2023, the Board sent a letter to the parties providing further
instructions regarding the filing of exceptions to the ALJ’s Proposed Default Order. The letter was
sent to Dr. Farrag at his address of record and via email to the same email address he used to
communicate with the OAH docket specialist. The letter was not returned to the Board as
undeliverable. Neither party filed exceptions. On December 20, 2023, this case came’ before

Disciplinary Panel B (“Panel B”) of the Board for final disposition.
