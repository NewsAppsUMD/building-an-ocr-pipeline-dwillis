FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
PROCEDURAL HISTORY

Ernesto Torres, M.D., was originally licensed to practice medicine in the State of
Maryland on June 21, 1979, under license number D23651.! On May 3, 2019, in the Circuit
Court for Frederick County, Case Number C-10-CR-19-000357, Dr. Torres was indicted by the
grand jury with one count of second-degree rape, one count of fourth-degree sex offense, and
one count of second-degree assault. On November 1, 2019, following a three-day bench trial,
Dr. Torres was acquitted of second-degree rape, but found guilty and convicted of one count of
fourth-degree sex offence, in violation of Md. Code Ann., Criminal Law Article (“Crim. Law’)
§ 3-308(b)(1) (2012 Repl. Vol. & 2018 Supp.), and one count of second-degree assault, in
violation of Crim. Law § 3-203.

The Court sentenced Dr. Torres to the maximum one-year of incarceration, after
concluding that the conviction of second-degree assault merged into the conviction for fourth-
degree sex offense, for purposes of sentencing. On January 16, 2020, Dr. Torres noted an appeal

to the Court of Special Appeals, which is currently pending as of the date of this Order.

'Dr. Torres’s license expired on September 30, 2019. Pursuant to section 14-403 of the Health Occupations Article,
the license of an individual regulated by the Board may not “lapse by operation of law while the individual is under
investigation or while charges are pending.” The Board’s investigation began before the expiration of Dr. Torres’s
license. Therefore, by operation of law, Dr. Torres’s license did not expire during these proceedings.
