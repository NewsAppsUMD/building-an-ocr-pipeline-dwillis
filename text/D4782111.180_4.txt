Parents 2 and 3 Interviews

24. Parent 2 reported that the Respondent, within minutes after the appointment
began, told her that her child’s (“Child 1°s”) eyes were “uneven” and that Child 1 needed
prism glasses after simply observing Child 1 sitting in a chair. The Respondent told
Parent 2 that her child was attempting to correct the unevenness by tilting her head.

25. On the first visit, the Respondent inserted prisms in Child 1’s glasses that he
had cut from a sheet of plastic. The Respondent instructed Parent 2 that Child 1 was to
wear the prism glasses 24 hours a day unless she was sleeping.

26. Parent 2 subsequently sought a second opinion from a_ pediatric
ophthalmologist who advised that Child 1 did not need prism glasses.

27. Parent 3 reported that she did not observe any eye examination equipment in
the Respondent’s office when she took her child (“Child 2”) to be examined. At the initial
appointment, the Respondent observed that Child 2 tilted his head to the left. At the next
visit, the Respondent applied prisms to Child 2’s glasses and told Parent 3 that Child 2

should wear the glasses as much as possible.
