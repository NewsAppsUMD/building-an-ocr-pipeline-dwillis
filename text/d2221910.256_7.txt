will deliver the fetus at any gestational age.” Dr. Alexander, however, did not manage Patient
A’s stillbirth conservatively. Instead, he ignored the fact that the fetus was deceased and went
through the steps of performing a medically induced abortion, as if the fetus was still viable. In
doing so, he administered digoxin without any documented medical indication and did not follow
the usual obstetric protocols which required the induction of labor and delivery to occur at a
higher level of care facility.

In light of the fact that Patient A was at an advanced stage of gestation and had an
intrauterine fetal death at an unknown point in time during her pregnancy, there was an increased
risk to the patient for infection and bleeding. The potential for harm was great and his office,
which lacked the safeguards and resources that are available at a higher level facility, was not the
proper setting to induce labor and deliver Patient A’s stillborn fetus.

The totality of Dr. Alexander’s conduct was unbecoming of a member in good standing
in the profession and is commonly understood as unprofessional within the medical community.
Based on the evidence presented, the Panel finds that Dr. Alexander is guilty of unprofessional
conduct in the practice of medicine. Dr. Alexander’s exception is denied.

Ill. Notice

Dr. Alexander argues that it would be unjust to find violations of the standard of care for
administering sedative medications without proper monitoring, failing to document the precise
time the fetus and placenta were delivered, and failing to produce medical records upon request
because these allegations were not specifically included in the charging document. Dr.
Alexander’s exception is moot, however, because the Panel does not find a standard of care
violation on any of these bases. The Panel’s findings are consistent with the allegations set out

in the charging document. See Regan v. State Bd. of Chiropractic Examiners, 355 Md. 397, 417-
