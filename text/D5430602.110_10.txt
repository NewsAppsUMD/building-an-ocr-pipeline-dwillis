new history or record an MSE on this occasion. The Respondent saw Patient 4 on eight
occasions between May 6, 2018 and January 2019. All of the Respondent’s post-May
2018 progress notes contain brief MSEs but none specifically contain a suicide risk
assessment. The Respondent noted that Patient 4 had pain complaints and was apparently
under the care of a primary care physician for these complaints. The Respondent ordered
a series of toxicology screenings that were at times negative for amphetamine and
uniformly positive for alprazolam, both of which the Respondent was prescribing.
Patient 4’s toxicology screens were also positive for various opioids, buprenorphine
and/or tramadol. The Respondent also prescribed omeprazole for “stomach upset.”

20. The Respondent failed to meet appropriate standards for the delivery of
quality medical care, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(22), and failed to keep
adequate medical records, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(40), with respect to
Patient 4, for reasons including:

(a) the Respondent failed to document or take a full history or MSE upon

Patient 4’s return to treatment;

(b) the Respondent failed to appropriately document or assess Patient 4 for

suicide risk;

(c) the Respondent failed to appropriately address Patient 4’s inconsistent

toxicology screens;

(d) the Respondent failed to address his prescribing of CDS (e.g., Vyvanse) in

view of Patient 4’s inconsistent toxicology screen results, or alter his

treatment in response to these findings;
