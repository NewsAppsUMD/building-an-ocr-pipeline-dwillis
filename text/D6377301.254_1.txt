NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board’s regulations, Dr. Willis has the right to request a full evidentiary hearing
before an Administrative Law Judge. This request will be granted if the Board receives a written
request for a hearing within TEN (10) days of the date of this letter. Any request for a hearing
should be sent to Christine A. Farrelly, Executive Director, at the Board’s address. If such a
hearing is requested, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set the hearing to
begin within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08 I, though that 30-day requirement
may be waived.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel B resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is, therefore, a public document.

Sincerely,

Signature On File

Christine A. Farrelly, Heegaive Direct]
Maryland State Board of Physicians
