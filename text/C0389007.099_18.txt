For the reasons that follow, I find the State has proved the Board’s charges and the
Respondent is subject to a disciplinary suspension and civil penalty.
Merits of the Charges

The evidence is conclusive the Respondent did not have a delegation agreement on file
starting January 1, 2015, after Physician A terminated their relationship. The Respondent
concedes this fact, although she argues she thought Hospital A filed a delegation agreement for
Physician C to take over for Physician A, and any other necessary delegation agreements. In
support, she testified an unspecified person at Hospital A told her when she was hired the
hospital would take care of any credentialing of her license; the Respondent signed an
unspecified application and gave it to that person; and the person said the hospital would file it.

To some extent, the Respondent and others at Hospital A had earnest confusion between
renewing a Board license and a delegation agreement, between a supervising physician under a
delegation agreement and a supervisor under the hospital’s hierarchy; and the degree to which
Hospital A would ensure a medical provider has all the necessary credentials. This confusion led
Lay Person A to incorrectly identify Physician D as the Respondent’s supervisor in the
“Termination of Employment (Delegation Agreement) Report,” dated April 11, 2017. Lay Person
A assumed Physician D was the Respondent’s supervisor because Physician D oversees the
physician, or primary care, group practices. The Respondent, however, knew or should have
known that someone who is a supervisor within the hospital’s organizational structure was not
necessarily her supervising physician under a delegation agreement. In fact, the Board had
notified her when she was first licensed she would need a delegation agreement with her

supervising physician; she knew she had not filed one after Physician C stopped supervising her;
