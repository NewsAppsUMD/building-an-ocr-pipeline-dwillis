On January 9, 2019, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
(“Board”) charged Christopher Wilson, Radiographer, with fraudulently or deceptively obtaining
a license, unprofessional conduct in the practice of radiography, willfully making a false
representation when seeking or making application for licensure or any other application related
to the practice of radiography, and failure to cooperate with a lawful investigation conducted by
the Board or a disciplinary panel, See Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 14-5B-14(a) (1), (3), (10),
and (26) (2014 Repl. Vol. 2018 Supp.). The charges alleged that Mr. Wilson made material
misstatements on his reinstatement application when he wrote that he had not been criminally
convicted and failed to respond to the Board when it attempted to investigate this misstatement.
On April 24, 2019, the case was referred to the Office of Administrative Hearings (“OAH”) for
an evidentiary hearing,
