oath on July 1, 2020. As part of that interview, the Respondent provided the following:

a, She has retired from private practice and is working part-time in a
clinic.

b. She obtains CRISP reports on her patients approximately every three
months unless she becomes suspicious of the patient, then she gets one
immediately. When she was in private practice her secretary would
obtain the CRISP reports for her. Since she has been at the Clinic she
has asked the secretary to obtain the CRISP reports for all of her
patients, For a period of time, however, the secretary at the Clinic was
not getting the CRISP reports. But the secretary at the Clinic is now
oblaining the reports for her. She further explained that she would have
personally obtained the CRISP reports herself, instead of having her
secretary do it, if that had been required, but she “was not aware that
CRISP required that I personally use the computer to get in to CRISP.”

c. She does not use drug contracts for her patients.
