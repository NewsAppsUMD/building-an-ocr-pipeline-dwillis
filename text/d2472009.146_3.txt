patients present. Additionally, the Respondent documented inappropriate comments in
patient records regarding Hospital A’s staff.

11. On or about May 7, 2016, despite Hospital A’s suspension of the Respondent's
hospital privileges, the Respondent attempted to gain entry to Hospital A in order to
treat a patient in the Cardiac Care Unit. Hospital A’s Staff and Security force barred the
Respondent's entry and the Respondent reportedly engaged in “a lot of yelling” as
witnessed by Hospital A’s staff, that “woke up most of the patients and family members.”
12. On or about May 17, 2016, Hospital A found that based on the Respondent’s
conduct, he was “likely an impaired practitioner” as defined by Hospital A’s bylaws and
procedures, and pursuant to the American Medical Association’s (“AMA's”) definition.°
In resolution of the precautionary suspension, Hospital A provided the Respondent with
an opportunity to take a voluntary leave of absence and to participate in the Maryland
Physician Health Program (“MPHP’). Upon the Respondent's successful
participation/completion of the MPHP, Hospital A would allow the Respondent to
request reinstatement of his privileges. If the Respondent did not accept Hospital A’s
offer, Hospital A would terminate the Respondent's hospital privileges and membership,
and he would be entitled to an evidentiary hearing.

13. On or about May 27, 2016, the Circuit Court for Prince George’s County granted
to Hospital A a Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”) against the Respondent based on
his failure to comply with the terms of the Precautionary Suspension imposed on May 6,

2016, as outlined in J 11.

° AMA ethical provision 9.031 defines impairment as a condition that interferes with the
Clinician’s ability to engage safely in professional activities.
