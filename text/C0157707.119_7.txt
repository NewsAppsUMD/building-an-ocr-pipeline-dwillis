Panel A concludes that Ms. Ferguson violated the terms and conditions of the August 26,
2015 Disposition Agreement by failing to comply with the terms of her MPRP Participant
Rehabilitation Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Disposition Agreement, the Panel is
authorized to impose additional sanctions on Ms. Ferguson’s license, ranging from a reprimand
to revocation.
SANCTION
In determining the appropriate sanction in this case, the Panel has taken into
consideration the presentations of both parties at the show cause hearing and the close proximity
in time of the three admitted violations. Both the State and Ms. Ferguson advocated for
continued treatment and participation with MPRP. The Panel has serious concerns as a result of
the three violations in approximately a six-month period and finds that a six-month suspension
with continued participation in MPRP, followed by a five-year period of probation, is
‘appropriate and needed.
