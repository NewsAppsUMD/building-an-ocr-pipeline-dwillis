relationship or without obtaining appropriate informed consent; and made possible billing
errors. Senior staff members also stated that they received reports from trainees and staff
involving the Respondent’s clinical judgment with respect to patient care.
Referral for evaluation and findings

13. As part of the Board’s investigation, the Board, pursuant to Health Occ. §
14-402(a),‘ referred the Respondent to a Board-approved program (the “Program”) for an
independent evaluation to determine his present competency to practice medicine. On
March 22, 2022, at the direction of the Program, the Respondent submitted to an
independent evaluation. The evaluator issued a report that the Respondent’s medical
condition “almost certainly precludes his ability to independently practice medicine.”

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Based upon the foregoing Investigative Findings, Panel B of the Board concludes
that the public health, safety, or welfare imperatively requires emergency action, and that
pursuant to State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2) and COMAR 10.32.02.08B(7), the Respondent's

license is summarily suspended.

“ Health Occ. § 14-402(a) states: In reviewing an application for licensure or in investigating an
allegation brought against a license physician or any allied health professional regulated by the Board
under this title, the Physician Rehabilitation Program may request the Board to direct, or the Board or a
disciplinary panel on its own initiative may direct, the licensed physician or any allied health professional
to an appropriate examination.
