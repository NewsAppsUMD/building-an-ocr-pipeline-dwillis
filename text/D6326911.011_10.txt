 

the Respondent drinking alcohol until November 2020 is that the Respondent continued to drink
after he was charged and pled guilty to driving while impaired by alcohol; after the Spring of 2016,
when a nurse with whom he worked reported that she believed he was drunk at work (to which the
Respondent replied that he had been drinking alcohol the night before); after September 2019,
which was when he was admitted to a hospital for a medical condition of which the treating
physician opined were probably associated with alcohol use (the Respondent reported at the time
that he was drinking three alcoholic drinks per day five days a week); after February 2020, when
he was intoxicated at work, resulting in approximately 30 patients’ appointments being cancelled;
after April 2020, when he was admitted to a hospital appearing mildly intoxicated by alcohol (the
Respondent said that he had at least three drinks before going to the hospital); after May 5, 2020,
when he was again intoxicated at work and all his patient visits had to be rescheduled; and then
from May 2020 until November 2020 (when his license was summarily suspended), he reported a
nightly habit of consuming alcohol in conjunction with Lunesta and oxycodone (reporting drinking
at least two beers four to five times a week during this period).

The ALJ found that “the State has proven that the Respondent was intoxicated on three
occasions: (1) March 15, 2011 (DUI incident); (2) April 27, 2020 (ER visit); and (3) May 5, 2020
(workplace incident). [The ALJ] conclude[d] that the three incidents of intoxication over the
course of more than nine years is not sufficient to sustain the Board’s charge that the Respondent
is habitually intoxicated.” The Panel does not accept this analysis.

First, the Panel does not accept the ALJ’s finding that the Respondent was not intoxicated
at work on February 17, 2020. The ALJ found that his swaying, crookedness walking, and
stumbling that day could have been caused by hip problems he was having. The ALJ did

acknowledge that the Respondent admitted to taking CDS and consuming alcohol the night before.
