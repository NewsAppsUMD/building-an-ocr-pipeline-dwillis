Dear Dr. Williams and Counsel:

On May 18, 2016, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued
an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE
in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t II, § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl. Vol.). Dr.
Williams was given an opportunity to attend a hearing before Disciplinary Panel B to show cause
why that suspension should not be continued on May 25, 2016. Dr. Williams attended the
hearing on that date together with his counsel, Catherine W. Steiner, Esq. The State was
represented by Victoria Pepper, Assistant Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor. Both
parties presented extensive oral arguments at the post-deprivation hearing.

After considering these arguments at the hearing and the investigative file, Disciplinary
Panel B determined that it would continue the summary suspension imposed on May 18, 2016.
Disciplinary Panel B thus will not lift the summary suspension order. The arguments submitted,
together with Dr. Williams’ presentation and responses to the Panel’s questions, when
considered in the light of the investigative findings in the file, persuade Disciplinary Panel B
there exists a substantial risk of serious harm to the public health, safety or welfare in Dr.
