 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Panel B finds Mr. Lee in default based upon his failure to appear at the OAH for the
prehearing conference scheduled for December 7, 2020. See State Gov't § 10-210(4). Based upon
the foregoing findings of fact, Panel B concludes that Mr. Lee fraudulently or deceptively obtained
or attempted to obtain a license, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-SA-17(a)(1); is guilty of
unprofessional or immoral conduct in the practice of respiratory care, in violation of Health Occ.
§ 14-5A-17(a)(3); willfully made or filed a false report or record in the practice of respiratory care,

Panel B will suspend Mr. Lee’s license to practice respiratory care until the time when the Board
receives Mr. Lee’s completed federal and state CHRC.
