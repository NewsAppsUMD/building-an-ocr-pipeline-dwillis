MBP’s Investigation

At several points during the hearing, the Respondent suggested that the Board’s
investigation was somehow improper or insufficient, In the course of her investigation, Ms,
Mullen conducted interviews, under oath, with Patient A, Ms. Gage Ms. Ms. <>
Patient B, Dr. Ge. the Respondent, Ms, Mullen also spoke with Ms, MRD over the

‘phone and produced extensive notes of their conversation. The Board obtained Patient A’s and
Patient B’s medical records, as well as other documents pertinent to the allegations regarding the
Respondent.

The Respondent argued that the Board’s failure to interview Ms @rendered its:
investigation inadequate. I disagree; while her input, particularly ag expressed in the hearing,
may have added somewhat to the Board’s investigation, it certainly would not have proven.
exculpatory to the Respondent. The other witnesses the Respondent produced, who were not
included in the Board’s investigation, were complimentary of the Respondent’s skills asa
physician, but were unable to shed any significant light on the Board’s specific allegations,*5
The general consensus of these witnesses was that the Respondent was a highly competent
Ob/Gyn, with a direct and forthright ities, who placed great effort and emphasis in attending
to patients’ needs and Promoting office efficiency. While the testimony offered by these
witnesses added to my understanding of the Respondent?s practice and character, their input
would not likely have Proven particularly relevant to the Board’s case, nor would it have likely
prevented or influenced the Board’s ultimate action, Consequently, I cannot find that the
Board’s investigation of the Respondent was inadequate or improper,
