10-217 (2014), The standard of proof is by a preponderance of the evidence. Md. Board of
Physicians y. Elliott, 170 Md. App. 369, 433-34 (2006), cert. denied 396 Md. 12 (2006). The
State. must prove that the acts described in the Charges are “more likely so than not.” MPJI-Cv
1 :7(a).
Jurisdiction and Peer Review: Individuals B, C,D and E
With regard to jurisdiction and peer review issues, on August 6, 2019, I issued a written
ruling on the Respondents Motion to Dismiss or in the Alternative, for Summary Decision, as to
Individuals B, C, D and E. I ruled that the allegations concerning Individual B and all
Individuals examined by the Respondent (C, D and E) outside of the State cannot be dismissed
as the Board has the jurisdiction to prosecute the Charges against the Respondent. As I have
already issued a ruling on the Board’s power and obligation to investigate and discipline licensed
Maryland physicians regardless of where the conduct occurred, jurisdiction is not addressed in
this decision. Additionally, the Respondent argued the charges against him arising from the ©
allegations of Individuals C, D, and E should be dismissed because the Board did not conduct
peer reviews. I ruled that the Respondent is not charged with violating sections 14-404(a)(22) -
(failing to meet appropriate standards for delivery of medical and surgical care in an outpatient
facility as determined by peer review) or 14-404(a)(40) (failing to keep adequate medical
records). Peer review is statutorily required for charges arising under section 14-404(a)(22) and
- 14-404(40), The Board was within its rights to determine the charges against the Respondent.
Consequently, I shall not address the peer review arguments pertaining to Individuals C, D, and

Eas I have already ruled on that matter.
