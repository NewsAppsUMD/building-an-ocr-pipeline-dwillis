(d) Extent to which the former patient confided personal or
‘ Pp Pp
private information to the health care practitioner;

(e) Degree of emotional dependence that the former patient has
or had on the health care practitioner;

(f) Extent to which the health care practitioner used or exploited
the trust, knowledge, emotions, or influence derived from the
previous health care practitioner-patient relationship; and

(g) | Whether the health care practitioner-patient relationship
was terminated in order to enter into a romantic or sexual
relationship.

The American Medical Association has issued the following ethical opinions

addressing the doctor/patient relationship.

Code of Medical Ethics Opinion 9.1.1 (2016) — Romantic or Sexual
Relationships With Patients.

Romantic or sexual interactions between physicians and patients that occur
concurrently with the patient physician relationship are unethical. Such
interactions detract from the goals of the patient-physician relationship and may
exploit the vulnerability of the patient, compromise the physician’s ability to make
objective judgments about the patient’s health care, and ultimately be detrimental
to the patient’s well-being.

A physician must terminate the patient-physician relationship before initiating a
dating, romantic, or sexual relationship with a patient.

Likewise, sexual or romantic relationships between a physician and a former
patient may be unduly influenced by the previous physician-patient relationship.
Sexual or romantic knowledge, emotions, or influence derived from the previous
professional relationship, or if a romantic relationship would otherwise
foreseeably harm the individual.
