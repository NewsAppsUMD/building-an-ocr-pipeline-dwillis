FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

 

INTRODUCTION

On April 30, 2018, Vitalis O. Ojiegbe, M.D. was charged under the Maryland Medical
Practice Act (“Act”) with unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine; willfully making or
filing a false report or record in the practice of medicine; failing to meet appropriate standards
for the delivery of quality medical care; failing to comply with the provisions of the Maryland
Pharmacy Act, Health Occupations Article § 12-102; willfully making a false representation
when seeking or making application for licensure or any other application related to the practice
of medicine; and failing to keep adequate medical records. See Md. Code Ann., Health Occ.
(“Health Occ.”) § 14-404(a)(3)(ii), (11), (22), (28), (36), and (40). Dr. Ojiegbe was also charged
with violating the March 12, 2015 Consent Order he entered into with Disciplinary Panel B of
the Maryland State Board of Physicians (“Board”).

The case was forwarded to the Office of Administrative Hearings (“OAH”) for an
evidentiary hearing and a proposed decision. The hearing was held before an Administrative
Law Judge (“ALJ”) at OAH on January 29, 2019. Due to the significant stipulations of facts and
evidence not in dispute, the State did not call any witnesses and presented its case solely through

oral argument. Dr. Ojiegbe testified but did not present any other witnesses.
