otherwise unable to use once opened for a patient, nor did the Respondent specify or detail any
mishaps for any patients that would explain the discrepancies between the number of patch tests
billed and the number recorded as performed. The Respondent routinely billed for more patch
tests than he actually performed, constituting unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine,
in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii).

Il. UNNECESSARY AND UNINDICATED TESTING

1. UNINDICATED PT AND EXCESSIVE ALLERGENS TESTED ON STPs

The Respondent routinely performed testing that was unnecessary, unindicated, and
excessive. He often performed PTs when there was no indication. On numerous occasions with
the SPTs, the Respondent unnecessarily tested a full panel of allergens (264). This was evident
with his testing of food allergens when there were no complaints, symptoms, or indicators for
these tests.

The Respondent billed for a full panel SPT (264 allergens) on Patient 1 on six occasions.
A full Panel was unnecessary and not indicated. On each of these SPTs there was “no indication
for SPT for food allergens beyond nuts.” (Dr. Jani, Tr. 36.) As Dr. Drelich explained, there may
have been justification to test for nuts “but not for 100-and-some-odd other foods.” (Tr. 229.)

On at least two occasions the Respondent billed for a full panel SPT on Patient 3, which
included extensive testing of food allergies. The testing for food allergens was not indicated:
“there’s no history of food allergy.” (Dr. Drelich, T. 234.)

On July 18, 2014, the Respondent performed PT on Patient 7. Both experts for the State
testified PT was not indicated. Dr. Jani testified, “There was no documentation to support the
need for patch testing.” (Tr. 87.) Dr. Jani further testified in support of her opinion that the

Respondent engaged in gross overutilization that “in the case of patch testing, it being applied
