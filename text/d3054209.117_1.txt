FINDINGS OF FACT

Unless stated otherwise, the Panel adopts the ALJ’s Proposed Findings of Fact §§ 1-24
and Discussion (pages 7-19), which are incorporated by reference into the body of this document
as if set forth in full. See attached ALJ Proposed Decision, Exhibit 1. The factual findings were
proven by the preponderance of the evidence.

Dr. Dalton was originally licensed to practice medicine in Maryland in 1984, and has
continuously renewed his license. He is board-certified in internal medicine and nephrology. At
all relevant times to this matter, he maintained a medical office in Catonsville, Maryland, where
the incidents occurred.

The charges against Dr. Dalton concerned two separate incidents. The first incident
concerns S.W., a personal care assistant, who was working for Company A, a company that
provides personal aides to mentally disabled adults. On December 5, 2015, S.W. accompanied
Patient A to visit Dr. Dalton, because Patient A was suffering from cold-like symptoms. S.W.,
who is a Muslim, wore a burga to the visit.!

After conducting a history and physical examination of Patient A, Dr. Dalton asked S.W.
if she had heard about the December 2, 2015, shooting attack in San Bernardino, California,
where a married couple, who were radical followers of Islam, killed fourteen people and
wounded twenty-two. S.W. said that she had not heard of the attack. Dr. Dalton repeatedly
asked her if she denounced the attack or supported the attackers’ actions. S.W. expressed that
the attacks were against the tenets of Islam. Dr. Dalton, nonetheless, lectured her that murder is
illegal in the United States. He then criticized her for wearing her burqa in the office. He told

S.W. that the attackers were “doing jihad in the name of Allah,” and became extremely agitated

"A burqa is a head-to-toe outer garment worn by women in some Islamic traditions.
