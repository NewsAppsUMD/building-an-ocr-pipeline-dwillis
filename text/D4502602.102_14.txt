terminated treatment with me.”

not see her at all,” until “we met at a store, and through friends and family in several
different social contexts.”

29. Since then, the Respondent admits that the Patient “and I have been close
friends for about three years....We have been going to dinner together for years. We have
celebrated birthdays together. In 2019, [the Patient] and I traveled abroad and...we slept
together in the same bed, but with absolutely no sexual contact of any kind.”

with prescriptions, medication samples and advise purely as a friend, not in a formal

professional capacity. This has been always free of charge and informally.”
