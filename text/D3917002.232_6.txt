2. Clinical Judgment and Reasoning

Dr. Mathur’s clinical judgment and reasoning were deemed generally inadequate in the
recognition of illness acuity. The physician consultants determined that he failed to recognize the
severity of illness in scenarios of urosepsis, diabetic ketoacidosis,* and atrial fibrillation. He also
did not recognize low-acuity presentations. Dr. Mathur’s knowledge limitations appeared to
impact his hypothetical patient care in situations involving coronary artery disease, hypertension,
diabetes, hypothyroidism, depression, chronic renal failure, and benign prostatic hyperplasia
(prostate gland enlargement). He was observed to be disorganized in his approach to the topic of
transient ischemic attack,” and his decision-making was concerning in other hypothetical areas of
patient care. Regarding chronic pain management and opioid prescribing, Dr. Mathur’s overall
approach was outdated and his knowledge and performance unacceptable. The physician
consultants further opined that in other instances, he did not appear to recognize his limitations
of knowledge. To address his inadequacies in clinical judgment and reasoning educationally, the
physician consultants determined that Dr. Mathur needed: a structured formulation of differential
diagnoses and a structured approach to patient evaluations; an ability to correctly assess acuity of
illness and plan appropriately; an ability to respond to emergent situations; appropriate and
up-to-date management of chronic pain conditions and the prescribing of opioid medications; an
application of knowledge to patient care; the use of evidence-based medical principles; and

consistent recognition of knowledge limitations.

* Diabetic ketoacidosis is a major complication of diabetes and can be life-threatening.

* A transient ischemic attack is a mini-stroke caused by a temporary blockage of blood flow to the brain.
