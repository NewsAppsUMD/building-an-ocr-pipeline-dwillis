have violated section 14-404. Health Oce. § 14-405. 1(a) (2014); COMAR 10.32.02.09A(3)(d).
The Board is also seeking a fine of $10,000.00. ,

In light of my findings regarding unprofessional conduct due to the Respondent’s failure
to disclose the relationship and maintain adequate documentation of prescriptions, I agree that
the reprimand and probationary period are appropriate,”> ] also agree that the $10,000.00 fine is
appropriate.*® However, as I have concluded that the actual care the Respondent provided was
not unprofessional, and that his conduct was not immoral, it is my recommendation that the
Board not suspend the Respondent. While the Board clearly has the authority to impose sucha .
suspension, there are significant mitigating factors in this case. The Respondent has no prior
disciplinary history. Further, his errors with regard to disclosure and documentation appear to. be
confined to the care he provided of: no evidence of a broader pattern was presented.

In addition, I note that the Respondent’s employer fi responded to the Board’s
charges on his behalf, and that the response indicates, repeatedly, that the Respondent has
engaged in a “critical self-assessment,” has acknowledged that he “failed to consider the
potential appearance of conflicts of interest in providing CDS prescriptions” of is
“remorseful” for his lapse in judgment, and is “committed, going forward, to exemplary practice
concerning prescribing pain medication and meticulously avoiding even the potential appearance
‘of a conflict of interest in treating all patients.” (Bd. Ex. 7.) This is consistent with the
Respondent’s testimony before me; the Respondent’s explanation for his actions was tempered

by his acknowledgement that he could have done more to ensure that his actions were above

reproach.
