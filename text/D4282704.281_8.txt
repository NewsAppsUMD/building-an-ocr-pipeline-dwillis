autonomy, and informed consent. Specifically, AMA Opinion 1.2.1 states:

When the patient is an immediate family member, the physician’s personal
feelings may unduly influence his or her professional medical judgment. Or
the physician may fail to probe sensitive areas when taking the medical
history or to perform intimate parts of the physical examination. Physicians
may feel obligated to provide care for family members despite feeling
uncomfortable doing so. They may also be inclined to treat problems that are
beyond their expertise or training.

 

Similarly, patients may feel uncomfortable receiving care from a family
member. A patient may be reluctant to disclose sensitive information or
undergo an intimate examination when the physician is an immediate family
member. This discomfort may particularly be the case when the patient is a
minor child, who may not feel free to refuse care from a parent.

In general, physicians should not treat themselves or members of their own
families. However, it may be acceptable to do so in limited circumstances:

(a) In emergency settings or isolated settings where there is no other
qualified physician available. In such situations, physicians should not
hesitate to treat themselves or family members until another physician
becomes available.

(b) For short-term, minor problems.

When treating self or family members, physician have a further responsibility
to:

(c) Document treatment or care provided and convey relevant

information to the patient’s primary care physician.

(d) Recognize that if tensions develop in the professional relationship
with a family member, perhaps as a result of a negative medical
outcome, such difficulties may be carried over into the family
member’s personal relationship with the physician.

(e) Avoid providing sensitive or intimate care especially for a minor
patient who is uncomfortable being treated by a family member.
