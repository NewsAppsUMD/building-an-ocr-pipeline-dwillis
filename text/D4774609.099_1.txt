abstaining from alcohol and drugs.

On May 7, 2019, the Office of the Attorney General filed with the Maryland Board of
Physicians (the “Board”) a petition to revoke Dr. Burke’s license to medicine (“the Petition”)
and a show cause order pursuant to section 14-404(b) of the Maryland Medical Practice Act in
Case Number 2219-0154B. The statute provides:

qd) On the filing of certified docket entries with the Board by the Office of the
Attorney General, a disciplinary panel shall order the suspension of a
license if the licensee is convicted of or pleads guilty or nolo contendere
with respect to a crime involving moral turpitude, whether or not any
appeal or other proceeding is pending to have the conviction or plea set
aside.

(2) After completion of the appellate process if the conviction has not been
reversed or the plea has not been set aside with respect to a crime
involving moral turpitude, a disciplinary panel shall order the revocation
of a license on the certification by the Office of the Attorney General,

Md, Code Ann., Health Occupations Article (“Health Occ.”) § 14-404(b) (2014 Repl. Vol. &
2018 Supp.). Attached to the Petition were copies of the indictment, certified docket entries, and
transcript of the plea agreement and sentencing hearing.

summarily suspended Dr, Burke’s medical license, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Government Article (State
Gov’t) § 10-226(c)(2) (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2018 Supp.), based on the panel’s conclusion that the public health,
safety, or welfare imperatively required emergency action. On December 3, 2018, Panel B charged Dr. Burke in
case number 2218-0155B, with violating Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii) (unprofessional conduct in the practice of
medicine) and (27) (sells, prescribes, gives away, or administers drugs for an illegitimate medical purpose). The
DCCR for that case is scheduled for September 25, 2019. In requesting the opportunity to appear at the DCCR to
address the Panel on this moral turpitude case, Dr. Burke confuses the process for resolution of disciplinary cases
