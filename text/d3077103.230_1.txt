the summary suspension was imposed, and be ordered to pay a $10,000 fine. Dr. Hardi and the
State both filed exceptions. On February 26, 2020, Disciplinary Panel B (“Panel B”) held an oral
exceptions hearing. |

FINDINGS OF FACT

Panel B adopts the ALJ’s Proposed Findings of Fact and the ALJ’s Discussion with
minor modifications. The ALJ’s Proposed Findings of Fact J 1-31, 33-111, and 113 and the
Discussion (pages 19-41) are incorporated by reference into the body of this document as if set
forth in full unless otherwise noted.? The findings of fact were proven by a preponderance of the
evidence. The ALJ’s Proposed Decision is attached as Exhibit 1. Paragraph 32 is replaced with
the following:

32. It is most likely that the error that resulted in a future medical procedure being
listed in the medical record was caused by the electronic medical recordkeeping computer
program. The parts of that record listing the “Diagnoses” and “Plan”, which includes an “MRI
Abdomen/Pelvis with and w[ith]/o[ut] contrast” and “Bun/Creatinine” accurately reflect the
patient visit that Individual A had with Dr. Hardi.

Paragraph 112 is replaced with the following:

112. The Respondent inadvertently touched Individual F’s left breast when pointing to
the source of the bleed that was located below her left breast.

INDIVIDUAL A

The ALJ found, and Dr. Hardi does not dispute, that Dr. Hardi had a sexual relationship
with a coworker, Individual A, from approximately February 2016 until June 2017. The ALJ
* Panel B does not adopt the discussion on Page 26 on lines 12-22 that pertains to Finding of Fact 432.

Also, Panel B does not adopt the discussion on pages 39 and 40 pertaining to the reasons Dr. Hardi
touched Individual F.
