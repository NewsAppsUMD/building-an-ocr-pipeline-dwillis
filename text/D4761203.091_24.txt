topic of human subject research. Both experts testified about surgical innovation and quality
improvement, prospective and retrospective research, and the requirements for IRB approval. They
agreed that IRB review and approval is required for prospective research but held divergent views
on the nature of Dr. MacKoul’s activities with the two groups of suture patients. Dr. Shamoo
opined that Dr. MacKoul initiated and engaged in prospective human subject research from 2013
to 2016 and the federal regulations required him to obtain advance IRB approval for that process.
Dr. Prentice disagreed with Dr. Shamoo’s opinion and described Dr. MacKoul’s activities as
surgical innovation and quality improvement.

1. Surgical Innovation and Quality hnprovement

Dr. Shamoo distinguished human subject research from patient treatment or innovation.
He testified that research is for the public good and treatment or innovation is to enhance the
wellbeing of an individual patient or handful of patients - for example, if a surgeon needs to use a
non-absorbable suture in a unique or emergency situation. Dr. Shamoo noted that there was no
documentation of an emergency in the hundreds of Ethibond surgical patients operated on by Dr.
MacKoul during his study. (T. 298, 300-303) Based on a guidance article presented by Dr.
MacKoul on surgical innovation versus IRB-required research activities (Resp. Exh. 33), Dr.
Shamoo explained that IRB review and approval is not required for surgical innovation if: 1) a
planned or unplanned innovation is being made for the care and treatment of an individual patient
or class of patients; and 2) there are no plans to collect data and/or analyze results for general
applicability or knowledge (i.e., to write up or provide to outside entities). Dr. Shamoo opined that
Dr. MacKoul’s own description of his Ethibond versus Vicryl surgical procedures on hundreds of

patients from 2013 to 2016, and his ongoing data collection and analysis comparing suture
