to seeking treatment from the Respondent. Patient 9 reported that she was previously
treated with medications for ADHD since elementary school. Patient 9 also reported
depressive symptoms and panic attacks. The Respondent diagnosed Patient 9 with
ADHD; MDD; and Panic Disorder. The Respondent’s treatment notes do not contain
prior treatment records from other providers.

34. The Respondent placed Patient 9 on a trial of Mydayis but it seriously
increased her anxiety. On May 10, 2018, the Respondent placed Patient 9 back on
Adderall. In the past, the Respondent had switched Patient 9 from Ambien 10 mg to
Klonopin 2 mg, at bedtime, as needed.

35. As of May 10, 2018, the Respondent’s medication regimen for Patient 9
consisted of: Adderall 30 mg, BID; Xanax 2 mg, BID, as needed; Paxil 10 mg, daily; and
Klonopin 2 mg, at bedtime, as needed.

36. Patient 9 reported that she was off her medications for a month in October
2018, at which point the Respondent restarted her medications. The Respondent saw
Patient 9 on four occasions between May 6, 2018 and January 2019.

37. During the course of treatment after May 6, 2018, the Respondent ordered a
toxicology screening that was positive for amphetamine, which he was prescribing, and
negative for benzodiazepine, which he was also prescribing. Prior toxicology screening
also noted this inconsistency as well as a positive finding for marijuana. The Respondent
did not appropriately address these inconsistencies in his treatment notes, or alter his

rescribing regimen for alprazolam, which he prescribed on an “as needed” basis.
