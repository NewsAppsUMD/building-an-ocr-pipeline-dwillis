Re: Surrender of License to Practice Medicine
Lloyd M. Charles, Jr., M.D. License Number: D35602
Case Number: 2016-0912 B

Dear Dr. Freas and Members of the Disciplinary Panel B,

Please be advised that I have decided to permanently SURRENDER my license
to practice medicine in the State of Maryland, License Number D35602 that expired on
September 30, 2016, effective immediately. I understand that upon surrender of my
license, I may not give medical advice or treatment to any individual, with or without
compensation, and cannot prescribe medications or otherwise engage in the practice of
medicine in the State of Maryland as it is defined in the Maryland Medical Practice Act
(the “Act”), Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. II §§ 14-101 et seq: (2014 Repl. Vol.) and other
applicable laws. In other words, as of the effective date of this Letter of Surrender, I
understand that the surrender of my license means that I am in the same position as an
unlicensed individual in the State of Maryland.

I understand that this Letter of Surrender is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT, and upon
Disciplinary Panel B’s (“Panel B”) acceptance, becomes a FINAL ORDER of Panel B
of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”).

I acknowledge that the Board initiated an investigation of my practice and on
January 6, 2017, Panel B issued disciplinary charges against me under Health Occ. II §
14-404(a)(3)(i), (13), and (33). Specifically, Panel B alleged that my conduct, failing to
respond to numerous written requests from the Board to respond to the allegations in the
complaints, failing to respond to the Board’s subpoena to be interviewed, and, failing to
provide the complete medical records of the children of Parents A, B, and C, constitutes
unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine in violation of Health Occ. II § 14-
404(a)(3)(ii), failure to provide patients’ medical record in violation of Health Occ. II §
14-404(a)(13), and, failure to cooperate with a lawful investigation conducted by the
Board in violation of Health Occ. II § 14-404(a)(33).

A copy of the disciplinary charges is attached as Attachment A.
