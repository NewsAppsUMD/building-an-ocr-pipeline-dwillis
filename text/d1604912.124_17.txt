B. Admissibility of Newspaper Articles, Exhibits 1 and 3

Dr. Egbert objects to the admission into evidence of newspaper articles from the
Baltimore Sun and Washington Post, Exhibits 1 and 3 respectively, because the articles contain
unreliable hearsay and prejudicial hyperbole. The Panel concludes that the articles were properly
admitted because they were relevant to the investigation and the issues raised in the charging
documents. The panel, nevertheless, gives Exhibits 1 and 3 little weight based on their reliability
limitations, and instead bases the Panel’s opinion on the State’s other evidentiary exhibits and
testimony at the hearing and argument before the Board.

C. Admissibility of Dr. Silverman’s Testimony

Dr. Egbert also excepts to the admission by the ALJ of Dr. Silverman’s curriculum vitae
and report based on the report’s reliance on the AMA ethics opinion. Dr. Egbert claims that the
AMA Code of Ethics was not adopted by the Panel and therefore cannot be applied to sanction a
licensee. The Panel agrees with Dr. Egbert that the Panel is not required to adopt or consider the
AMA’s Ethics Opinion. Nor is the Panel required to accept the opinion of Dr. Silverman. The
Panel may do so and chooses to do so here. The Board concludes that Dr. Silverman’s expert
report is relevant and its reliance on the AMA ethics opinion does not render it inadmissible.
The Panel agrees with the State that unprofessional conduct expressly includes conduct that
breaches rules or ethical codes of professional conduct. Finucan, 380 Md. at 593. See also

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
The Panel concludes that Dr. Egbert’s actions, as described above, constitute

unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii).
