Disciplinary Panel B also determined that it would continue the summary suspension
imposed on November 5, 2020. Disciplinary Panel B thus will not lift the order of summary
suspension, Disciplinary Panel B finds that the public health, safety, and welfare imperatively
requires the summary suspension of your license to practice medicine. See State Gov’t § 10-

226(c)(2)(i). The order of summary suspension is reaffirmed and continues in effect. See COMAR
10.32.02.08H(1).

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel B resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely yours,
