returned to OAH as undeliverable.

On October 26, 2020, the State filed a request for a remote hearing, citing the public health
risk of an in-person hearing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On October 28, 2020, the ALJ
granted the State’s request for a remote hearing and notified the parties of the decision in written
correspondence sent to their email addresses. Included in the email were instructions about the
Google Meet platform, instructions on how to join the hearing, and a list of answers to frequently
asked questions. The email also stated that a failure to join the hearing by video or telephone
would be considered a failure to appear and could result in a default judgment. The email was not
returned as undeliverable, and Dr. Williams did not request a postponement or otherwise object to
the hearing being conducted remotely.

On November 4, 2020, the ALJ convened the hearing on the Google Meet platform at 9:30

Williams did not join the hearing and did not notify OAH of any technical problems or other reason
for his failure to attend the hearing. At approximately 9:45 a.m., fifteen minutes past the scheduled
start time of the hearing, the administrative prosecutor moved for an Order of Default.

Under OAH’s rules of procedure, “[i]f, after receiving proper notice, a party fails to attend
or participate in a prehearing conference, hearing, or other stage of a proceeding, the judge may
proceed in that party’s absence or may, in accordance with the hearing authority delegated by the
agency, issue a final or proposed default order against the defaulting party.” COMAR

On November 17, 2020, the ALJ issued a Proposed Default Order. The ALJ found that
