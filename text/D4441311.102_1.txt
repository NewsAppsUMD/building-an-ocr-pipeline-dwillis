In a Proposed Decision issued on May 12, 2022, the ALJ recommended that the charges
issued by Panel B be upheld. As a sanction, the ALJ recommended that Dr. Gianelle’s medical
license be suspended for three years, to be stayed pending completion of: a three-year probation;
courses in ethics and professional boundaries within 6 months; and payment of a civil fine of
$15,000 also within 6 months. The ALJ also recommended that Dr. Gianelle be placed in the
Board’s rehabilitation program and comply with all of the program’s rules, referrals and
recommendations.

Dr. Gianelle filed written exceptions to the ALJ’s Proposed Decision, and the State filed
a response to Dr. Gianelle’s exceptions. Both parties appeared before Disciplinary Panel A of the

including the evidentiary record made before the ALJ, and the written exceptions and oral
arguments by both parties, Panel A now issues this Final Decision and Order.
