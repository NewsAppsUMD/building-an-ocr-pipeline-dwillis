13. On November 13, 2018, Board staff notified the Respondent of the Board’s
investigation and conducted a site visit of the Respondent’s practice. Board staff
observed/photographed the following: °

a. Board staff observed the Respondent’s young child in the
Respondent’s personal office;

b. Board staff observed two plastic bags containing empty
prescription pill bottles, most of which were labeled. One of
the bags was located in the Respondent’s prescription sample
room. The second bag was located on the Respondent’s desk.
The Respondent advised that on occasion, her patients return
unwanted medications, which she had staff dispose of. The
Respondent stated she uses the bottles collected when she
travels on missionary trips to Africa;

c. Board staff observed a single white pill, possibly Clonidine,”
laying on an end table (approximately four feet high) located
in the back left of the Respondent’s office. When asked, the
Respondent was not able to identify what type of pill or
medication it was; and

d. Board staff observed a bottle of gabapentin 300 mg in the
Respondent's desk’s upper storage area. Gabapentin is a
prescription-only medication that is prescribed to treat
neuropathic pain. The medication was prescribed by a
physician who was not a member of the Respondent’s
practice. When questioned regarding this, the Respondent
claimed that her patient returned the medication to her
because of its side effects. The Respondent stated that she
does not personally use this medication because it is for
“nerve pain.”

? Board staff identified this medication by the identifying information (U-136) inscribed on the pill.
Clonidine is a prescription-only, anti-hypertensive medication.
