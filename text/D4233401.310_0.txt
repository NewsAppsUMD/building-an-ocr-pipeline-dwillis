FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

On March 8, 2019, Disciplinary Panel A (“Panel A”) of the Maryland State Board of
Physicians (the “Board”) issued an Order of Summary Suspension against Respondent Kuchak
K. Jalali, M.D., which suspended his license to practice medicine in Maryland. On March 14,
2019, Panel A continued the summary suspension after a show cause hearing at which Dr, Jalali
failed to appear. Dr. Jalali did not request an evidentiary hearing to challenge the Order of
Summary Suspension. On April 10, 2019, Panel A issued charges against Dr. Jalali for violating
the Maryland Medical Practice Act, Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. §§ 14-101—14-702.
Specifically, Dr. Jalali was charged with violating § 14-404(a)(4) of the Health Occupations
Article, alleging that Dr, Jalali was professionally, physically, or mentally incompetent. The
case was forwarded to the Office of Administrative Hearings (“OAH”).

On July 23, 2019, an Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) at OAH held a hearing on the
charges. Dr. Jalali was represented by legal counsel; Dr. Jalali did not personally appear. The
State was represented by an administrative prosecutor from the Office of the Attorney General.

On October 21, 2019, the ALJ issued a proposed decision in which the ALJ upheld the
charge that Dr. Jalali was mentally incompetent, Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(4), and recommended

the revocation of his medical license. Neither party filed exceptions to the ALJ’s proposed

decision.
