Thereafter, the Board initiated an investigation.

Failure to Cooperate

[Dr. Adams]’s address of record with the Board. The initial contact letter
informed [Dr. Adams] of the complaint against him and the Board's investigation.
The initial contact letter also requested that [Dr. Adams] submit a written
response within 10 days and return a completed Information Form.

about March 3, 2016, the initial contact letter was re-issued to [Dr. Adams] at the
same address. [Dr. Adams] failed to respond. On or about March 4, 2016, the

interview with a Board investigator on March 24, 2016. The subpoena was mailed
to [Dr. Adams]’s address of record with the Board.

On or about March 15, 2016, the Board’s investigator sent [Dr. Adams] an
e-mail requesting that [Dr. Adams] contact her regarding the Board’s case. The e-
mail was returned with an error message. On or about March 16, 2016, the
Board’s investigator conducted a Motor Vehicle Administration address search
and obtained a Cumberland, Maryland address for [Dr. Adams]. The Board’s
investigator sent the subpoena ad testificandum to the Cumberland, Maryland
address via UPS Ground. UPS tracking indicates that the subpoena was delivered
on March 17, 2016.

returned by the postal service. To date, [Dr. Adams] has failed to contact the
