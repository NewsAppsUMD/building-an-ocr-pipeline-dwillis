Unbeknownst to anyone else at the [the employer] (including [the
Respondent]), one of [the Respondent's] assistants took it upon herself to
complete the on-line tests for [the Respondent]. This was discovered as
part of our internal process of verifying dispensing authority. The assistant
was questioned and admitted to finishing the testing instead of [the
Respondent], and stated that [the Respondent] was unaware of her
"agsistance." As a result of [the assistant's] actions, we have terminated
her employment with us. [The Respondent] was questioned and confirmed

that he was totally unaware of her actions.
