Re: Edward Arrison, M.D,
Case No.: 2221-0007A
License No.: D50993

Dear Dr. Arrison and Counsel:

On August 25, 2020, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl.
Vol. and 2019 Supp.). Dr. Arrison was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing
before Disciplinary Panel A on September 9, 2020, to show cause why that suspension should not
be continued. Dr. Arrison attended the hearing on that date together with his counsel, Mare K.
Cohen, Esq. The State was represented by Robert J. Gilbert, Deputy Counsel, Administrative
Prosecutor. Both parties presented oral arguments at the post-deprivation hearing.

After consideration of the presentations of the parties, Disciplinary Panel A determined
that it would continue the summary suspension imposed on August 25, 2020. Disciplinary Panel
A thus will not lift the order of summary suspension. Disciplinary Panel A finds that the public
health, safety, and welfare imperatively requires the summary suspension of your license to
practice medicine, See State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2)(i). The order of summary suspension is thus
reaffirmed and continues in effect. See COMAR 10.32.02.08H(1).
