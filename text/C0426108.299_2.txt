 

FINDINGS OF FACT

 

Panel B adopts the findings of fact numbered 1-28 proposed by the ALJ with one
modification. The panel corrects the date in Finding of Fact 3 of the ALJ’s Proposed Decision to
state that Mr. Gbadamosi pleaded guilty to and was convicted of criminal trespass, a
misdemeanor, in the State Court of Cobb County, Georgia, on February 18, 2014. The panel
adopts that finding as amended. (The ALJ’s Proposed Decision of February 22, 2019 is
incorporated by reference into this Final Decision and Order and is appended to this Order as
Attachment A).

In addition to her findings that Mr. Gbadamosi falsely answered questions on Board
licensure applications in 2014 and 2017, and on a Maryland Hospital Credentialing Application
in July, 2015, the ALJ made the following findings regarding Mr, Gbadamosi’s employment
history:

(1) Mr. Gbadamosi was terminated from his position at a medical practice in June, 2015,

after three weeks of employment, due to poor attendance and failure to follow policy and
protocols, See Finding of Fact 12; ALJ Proposed Dec., pp. 15-16.

(2) Mr. Gbadamosi failed to disclose that prior employment on his July, 2015
credentialing application, when he applied for another position at a hospital facility that month,
despite clear language on that application requiring that the applicant list “ALL HEALTHCARE
FACILITIES at which you hold or have held privileges.” See Finding of Fact 17; ALJ Proposed
Dec., p. 18.

(3) Mr. Gbadamosi falsely answered “NO” to another question on the 2015 hospital
credentialing application asking whether his membership on the staff of “any facility, health

plan, or HMO ... had “ever been voluntarily or involuntarily withdrawn, relinquished . . .
