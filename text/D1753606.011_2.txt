the interview, Dr. Salihi was asked for the names of former staff members who were employed at
his former practice and he could not remember their names. As a result, Panel A sent Dr. Salihi
for an independent evaluation, pursuant to Health Occ. § 14-402(a), to assess Dr. Salihi’s
competence to practice medicine. The evaluator opined that Dr. Salihi was not competent to safely

EXCEPTIONS

Dr. Salihi takes exception to one of the ALJ’s proposed findings of fact and the conclusion
of law that he was mentally incompetent to practice medicine. He argues that the ALJ

interview with Board staff. Dr. Salihi also argues that the report and the opinions of the
independent evaluator hired by the Board should be rejected because the doctor did not personally
administer the tests on which his opinion was based. Finally, he argues that the ALJ erred by
failing to give sufficient weight to the testimony of his expert and fact witnesses. Each of Dr.
Salihi’s exceptions will be addressed, in turn. .

asked specifically if he remembered the two individuals [Dr.: Salihi] replied: “I

really don’t recall them, | don’t. I should, but I don’t. I’m telling you the fact — the

truth. I don’t recall.”
Ina footnote, the ALJ clarified that Dr. Salihi later remembered one of the two employees he was

asked about and explained that she had a different last name. Dr. Salihi argues that the ALJ

misunderstood his statement, and he claims that he did not work with these individuals for ten
