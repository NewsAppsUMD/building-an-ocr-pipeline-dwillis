FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

INTRODUCTION AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

 

Paula M. Nelson, M.D., (“Respondent” or “Dr. Nelson,”) a dermatologist, was
initially licensed to practice medicine in Maryland on March 14, 2011. Dr. Nelson’s
license expired on September 30, 2017.' In 2014, the Maryland State Board of
Physicians (the “Board”) received a complaint alleging that a physician assistant was
being improperly supervised and that Dr. Nelson and other providers were grossly
overutilizing dermatologic procedures. The Board opened an investigation. In 2016,
the Board received a second complaint from an anonymous “employee” alleging
substandard office conditions, an eviction notice, and that unauthorized practitioners
were performing procedures.

On January 12, 2017, Disciplinary Panel A ("Panel A”) of the Board filed charges
against Dr. Nelson alleging violations of § 14-404(a)(3)(ii) and (19) of the Health
Occupations Article for unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine and gross
overutilization of health services, respectively. The charges also alleged violations of

Health Occ. § 1-302(a)(1)-(3) and (d)(3) for prohibited referrals to a health care entity in

'A physician’s medical license does not lapse while the individual is under investigation or while charges
are pending. See Health Occ. § 14-403(a). Therefore, the Board maintains jurisdiction over Dr. Nelson's
license for the purpose of these proceedings.
