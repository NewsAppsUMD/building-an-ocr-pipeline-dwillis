Re: Surrender of License to Practice Medicine
Crystal M. McGinty, M.D. License Number: D36182
Case Number: 2219-0011A

Dear Dr. Bhandari and Members of Disciplinary Panel A,

Please be advised that, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. (“Health Occ.”)
§14-403 (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2018 Supp.),I have decided to SURRENDER my license to
practice medicine in the State of Maryland, License Number D36182, effective
immediately. I understand that upon surrender of my license, I may not give medical advice
or treatment to any individual, with or without compensation, and cannot prescribe
medications or otherwise engage in the practice of medicine in the State of Maryland as it
is defined in the Maryland Medical Practice Act (the “Act”), Health Occ. §§ 14-101 ef seq.
and other applicable laws. In other words, as of the effective date of this Letter of
Surrender, I understand that the surrender of my license means that I am in the same
position as an unlicensed individual in the State of Maryland.

I understand that this Letter of Surrender is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT, and upon
Disciplinary Panel A’s (“Panel A”) acceptance, becomes a FINAL ORDER of Panel A of the
Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”).

I acknowledge that the Board initiated an investigation of my practice and on
January 4, 2019, Panel A issued disciplinary charges against me under Health Occ. § 14-
404(a)(3)Gii) Cs guilty of unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine); and § 14-
404(a)(4) (Is professionally, physically, or mentally incompetent). Based on the Board’s
investigation, the charging document included allegations concerning large quantities of
opioids that I prescribed and a requirement that I submit to an appropriate examination
directed by the Board pursuant to § 14-402 of the Act. A copy of the charging document is
attached as Attachment 1.

Based on the Board’s investigation, the charging document also revealed that a
criminal indictment was filed against me on July 31, 2018, in federal court. On January 2,
2019, I pleaded guilty to (1) mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1341; and (2) theft of
government property, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 641, based on my receipt of Social
