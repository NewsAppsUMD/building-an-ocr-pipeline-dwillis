testified that the record stated that midazolam was administered to Patient A at 5:00 am, 7:00,
9:00 am, and 12:00. When asked how Patient A received midazolam at 12:00 when she was
discharged at 10:00 am, Dr. C. Browne acknowledged the uncertainty as to whether 12:00
referred to 12:00 midnight or 12:00 noon, that the record may have been out of sequence, and
that the standard of care required that the date and time medications were administered be clearly
documented. Dr. C. Browne also acknowledged that the standard of care required Patient A be
monitored after being given I.V. sedation (Nubain and midazolam) and that the record did not
show that Patient A was monitored except at 9:15 am, 9:30 am, and 9:45 am. Dr. C. Browne
further acknowledged that the standard of care required that Patient A’s estimated blood loss be
documented but was not. Dr. C. Browne agreed that it was prudent to discharge a patient who
had received I.V. sedation to a responsible individual; however, he did not agree that it was
required. Dr. C. Browne also agreed that it would have been prudent to document that Patient A
was discharged to a hotel the night before the procedure after she had received Mifeprex and
lamineria, although he was not sure whether that was required.

I note that Dr. C. Browne did not produce a written report that was admitted into
evidence. The only document I have signed by Dr. C. Browne is a series of conclusory proffers
written by the Respondent’s counsel. This document is not helpful in explaining the basis of Dr.
C. Browne’s opinions.

In sum, Dr. C. Browne’s testimony was contradictory regarding whether the
Respondent’s medical record met the standard of care. Further, Dr. C. Browne’s testimony
failed to acknowledge important facts and failed to adequately explain his reasons for concluding
that the Respondent met the standard of care. J find Dr. Rafi’s and Dr. M. Browne’s detailed

testimony far outweighs Dr. C. Browne’s problematic testimony.
