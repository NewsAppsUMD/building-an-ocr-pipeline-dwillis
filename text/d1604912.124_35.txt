Banks, 354 Md. at 72 (quoting McDonnell, 301 Md. at 437). In so holding, the Court
distinguished the circumstances in Banks from those in McDonnell and offered the following

reasoning:

On one previous occasion this Court examined what is embraced by the phrase “in
the practice of medicine." In McDonnell v. Comm'n on Medical Discipline, 301
Md. 426, 429-430, 483 A.2d 76, 77-78 (1984), we considered the question of
whether a physician's attempt to intimidate adverse expert witnesses scheduled to
testify against him in a medical malpractice case was "immoral conduct of a
physician in his practice as a physician" in violation of § 14-404(a)(3)'s statutory
predecessor, Code (1957, 1980 Repl. Vol.), Article 43, § 130(h)(8). We held that,
although Dr. McDonnell's conduct was "improper and not to be condoned," it was
“not censurable under § [14-404(a)(3)]." McDonnell, 301 Md. at 434, 483 A.2d at
80. The Court agreed that Dr. McDonnell's act was "related to his professional
practice" but was insufficient to bring his conduct within the statute's requirement
that the conduct occur in his “practice as a physician." 301 Md. at 437, 483 A.2d
at 81. We held that immoral conduct merely committed during the term of
licensure or having only a "general or associative relationship to the physician in
his capacity as a member of the medical profession" is not within the language of
the statute. 301 Md. at 436, 483 A.2d at 81. Rather, the "application of [§ 14-
404(a)(3)] is directly tied to the physician's conduct in the actual performance of
the practice of medicine, i.e., in the diagnosis, care, or treatment of patients." 301
Md. at 437, 483 A.2d at 81.

Banks, 354 Md. at 70-71.

Particularly, the Court explained that “the primary factors that distinguish the Banks case
from McDonnell were that Dr. Banks was on duty at the hospital, and was present in the working
areas of the hospital.” Jd. at 74. The Court further explained that “[iJn other cases considering
whether a physician’s conduct was within the statutory definition of “in the practice of
medicine,” a critical factor has been whether the conduct occurred while the physician was
performing a task integral to his or her medical practice.” Jd. The Court refused to apply “a
narrow definition of the practice of medicine.” Id.

In Finucan, a case relatively similar to Banks, a physician engaged in sexual relationships

with patients and argued that his conduct did not occur in the practice of medicine because he
