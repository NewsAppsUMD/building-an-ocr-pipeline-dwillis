oxycodone 30mg ranked as the 375th most common prescription by other pain
management specialists in Maryland. The PBM also noted that the Respondent rarely
prescribed other pain medications such as hydrocodone, suggesting a ““‘one-size-fits-all’
approach to practicing medicine.”

7. A second complaint, dated March 22, 2019, was from the Maryland Office
of Controlled Substances Administration (“OCSA”). In its complaint, OCSA
summarized the findings it made over the course of several inspections, noting that the
Respondent’s prescriptions had multiple “red flags,” including “high strength/quantity,
cocktails, in-state long distance patients, out of state patients, and patients younger than
40 years old.” As a result, OCSA labeled the Respondent as a “prescriber of note.”

8. Three subsequent complaints, received on June 18, 2019, July 23, 2019,
and September 11, 2019, were all submitted anonymously and alleged that, among other
things, the Respondent was prescribing dangerously high levels of opioids and
benzodiazepines.

9. The sixth complaint, received on or about December 16, 2019, was again
from OCSA and based on a recent inspection of the Respondent’s office. The inspection
had found multiple dispensing violations, including but not limited to expired
medications mixed with regular stock, failing to provide written prescriptions to patients,
non-compliant labeling, and failing to report any dispensed controlled dangerous
substances (“CDS”) to the Maryland Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (“PDMP”).
The inspector also noted that she observed multiple out-of-state license plates on cars in

the parking lot when she arrived at the Respondent’s office for the inspection.
