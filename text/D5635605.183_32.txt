underwear. Complainant 1 acknowledged that she pulled the number of times (“seven”) out of the
air. In her complaint to the Board, Complainant 1 wrote that he “often” commented on the color
of her undergarments. The Respondent testified that he did not recall commenting on the color of
her underwear. The ALJ stated that Complainant 1’s choosing the specific number “seven” out of
the air “hardly enhanced her credibility,” but the ALJ found that her testimony on the number of
times it occurred did not negate her testimony indicating that he commented on her underwear
more than once. The Panel agrees with the ALJ’s analysis.

The Panel denies the Respondent’s exception. The Panel finds that the Respondent’s
demeaning conduct toward Complainant 1, specifically telling her to put the Medtronic balls in
her mouth, placing his hand on her chest partially inside her scrub shirt without her consent,
touching Complainant 1’s back without her consent, and commenting on the color of her
underwear constitutes unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation of Health
Oce. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii). See Banks, 354 Md. at 62-64.

B. Individual 7

The Respondent takes exception to the ALJ’s finding that the Respondent engaged in
sexual misconduct for saying to Individual 7, after following her into the OR, that “[i]t’s a good
thing you have a cute little butt so you can squeeze through.” Individual 7 was an OR housekeeper
who sterilized the OR rooms. The Respondent testified before the ALJ, “I had no idea who
[Individual 7] was. I wouldn’t have been able to pick her out of a lineup. I have never spoken to
{Individual 7]. I didn’t know who she was until she showed up here.” The Respondent argues that
Individual 7’s testimony was influenced by statements made by others at the Hospital about the

Respondent.
