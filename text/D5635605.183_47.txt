and degraded the teamwork approach that is necessary for proper medical care. Complainant 2
testified about her concerns after witnessing the Respondent slapping the Patient’s buttocks:

And when he did these things towards one of his patients | felt there

was no line that he would not cross. That I had to somehow remove

myself from his OR and change my schedule to do something about

this.

The Respondent’s sexual harassment of Complainant 2, by itself, was more threatening to
patient safety than the conduct of Dr. Banks for which Dr. Banks was sanctioned under § 14-
404(a)(3). Dr. Banks’ victims were hospital staff, such as unit secretaries, who did not directly
provide care, while Complainant 2 worked in the OR as a surgical technologist. See Banks, 354
Md. at 62-63.

The Panel also finds the Respondent’s slapping of the anesthetized patient’s buttocks and
his unwanted and unauthorized grabbing of Individual 10’s breasts and touching of Individual 10’s
vagina shows that the Respondent was clearly not dedicated to preserving those patients’ human
dignity, in violation of Principle I of the AMA’s Principles. Further, as in Shirazi, the Respondent
“used his position as a physician to take advantage of... women who relied on him for their
medical treatment.” Shirazi, 199 Md. App. at 478.

Based upon the findings of fact, discussion, and reasons set forth in this decision, Panel B
concludes that the Respondent is guilty of: immoral conduct in the practice of medicine, in
violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(i); and unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine,
in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii).

THE SANCTION

The ALJ recommended the revocation of the Respondent’s license and that the Respondent

could apply for reinstatement after one year. The Respondent took exception. The Respondent

argues for an 18-month suspension that would begin retroactively from the date his license was
