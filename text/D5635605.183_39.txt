 

it clear to the Respondent that she did not want him to touch her. Individual 11 said that when the
Respondent tickled her, she “stopped filling out my paperwork to confront Dr. Benalcazar.”
Individual 11 testified that, at the time she was tickled, she was filling out a form concerning
biological agents used for surgery. Individual 11 also said that the Respondent tickling her made
her. “uncomfortable” and “upset and a little angry.” When asked whether the tickling was
distracting, Individual 11 answered, “Yes.”

The Respondent took exception to the ALJ’s finding that he tickled Individual 11. The
Respondent testified that he grabbed Individual 11’s shoulders to get her attention to tell her
something that she needed to do. He did not acknowledge tickling Individual 11. In any case, the
Panel does not find the Respondent credible, while Individual 11’s testimony was straightforward,
detailed, and reasonable. The Panel finds Individual 11 credible and accepts her testimony. The
Respondent’s exception is denied.

The Respondent is guilty of unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in vidlation
of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii), for tickling Individual 11.
