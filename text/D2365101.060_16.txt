anxiety, Which had worsened when she went to college. In March 2019, the Respondent prescribed
sertialine (brand name Zoloft)â€™ and clonazepam (brand name Klonopiit) 7 and diagnosed her as
having generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). He stated it would take two weeks for the medication to
achieve full effects, so he wanted her to check in to see if the dosage should be increased.

The Patient only took the clonazepam a few times because she reported that it made her feel
out of it, and like a vegetable. She explained the difference between the anxiety and panic attacks
she experiences, When she has an anxiety attack she can stil function and speak, but gets upset and

sweaty. When she has a panic-attack, she is freaking out, has a hard time getting words out, her

mind does not Jet her think, and she becomes sweaty and red-faced, She has a panic attack when she |

has to make an oral presentation, and has anxiely attacks when meeting with professors and
teachers. When she has a panic attack, she can sometimes lose track of time and feel something
lasted longer than it did in reality,
