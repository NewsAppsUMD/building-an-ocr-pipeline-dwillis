Code Ann., Health Occ. §§ 14-404(a)(3)(ii), § 14-404(a)(7), and § 14-404(a)(9)(i), respectively.
Pursuant to the 2017 Consent Order, Panel A suspended Dr. Andrews’s medical license and
required her to enroll in MPRP and comply with MPRP’s requirements. In February 2018, Dr.
Andrews petitioned Panel A for termination of her suspension after MPRP endorsed her return to
the practice of medicine.
Order Terminating Suspension and Imposing Probation: May 25, 2018

On May 25, 2018, Panel A issued an Order Terminating Suspension and Imposing
Probation, in which it terminated Dr. Andrews’s suspension imposed under the 2017 Consent
Order. Panel A placed Dr. Andrews on probation for a minimum period of three years, required
her to remain enrolled in MPRP, to continue in a Participant Rehabilitation Agreement and
Participant Rehabilitation Plan, and to fully and timely cooperate and comply with all of the
Program’s referrals, rules, and requirements. In addition, the May 2018 Order provided that if Dr.
Andrews failed to comply with any terms or conditions of that Order, the Board or a disciplinary
panel, after notice and an opportunity for an appropriate hearing, could take further disciplinary
action against her.
Violation of the Participant Rehabilitation Agreement and May 2018 Order

In August 2019, MPRP notified the Board that Dr. Andrews had violated her 2018
Participant Rehabilitation Agreement. The Board requested a written response from Dr. Andrews.
In a letter dated August 18, 2019, Dr. Andrews acknowledged that she had engaged in conduct
that violated her Rehabilitation Agreement and provided an explanation of the circumstances of
her violation. In September 2019, Panel A issued a Violation of Board Order and Notice to Show

Cause charging Dr. Andrews with violating the May 2018 Order.
