she could not enter inpatient treatment due to issues pertaining to childcare. The Administrative
Prosecutor argued that Ms. Chastain’s license should be revoked due to her repeated violations of
the Rehabilitation Agreement she entered into with MPRP.
CONCLUSION OF LAW

Panel B concludes that Ms. Chastain failed to comply with suspension condition 1(c) of
the June 13, 2022 Consent Order by failing to comply with the Participant Rehabilitation Plan
entered into with MPRP.

SANCTION

Pursuant to the June 13, 2022 Consent Order, upon a finding of a violation, the Panel may
reprimand Ms. Chastain, place Ms. Chastain on probation with appropriate terms and conditions,
suspend, or revoke Ms. Chastain’s license to practice medicine in Maryland. Ms. Chastain was
given many opportunities to comply with MPRP as required by the Consent Order and she violated
the terms of her Participant Rehabilitation Agreement on numerous occasions. Ms. Chastain also
declined to follow MPRP’s treatment recommendations following her violations. Ms. Chastain
repeatedly failed to demonstrate that she is capable of complying with the requirements of MPRP.
The Panel finds that revocation is the appropriate sanction in this case.

ORDER

It is, thus, by Board Disciplinary Panel B, hereby

ORDERED that the license of Krista Chastain, license number RO9509, to practice as a
radiographer in Maryland, is REVOKED; and it is further

ORDERED that this Order is a public document. See Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. §§ L-
607, 14-411.1(b)(2) and Gen. Prov. § 4-333(b)(6).
