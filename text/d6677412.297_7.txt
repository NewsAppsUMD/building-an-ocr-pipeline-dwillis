As discussed below, however, the Panel does not find a violation with respect to Patient 7,
therefore the admissibility of the transcript of Patient 7’s interview is of no consequence to Dr.
Williams. Dr. Williams’s exception on this issue is denied.

IV. Amending of Charges (Exception 5)

During the hearing, the State sought to modify several statements in the amended charges
to accurately reflect the testimony of the witnesses who had previously testified at the hearing.
Dr. Williams objected and argued that the amending of the charges in the middle of the hearing
precluded him from later arguing that the charges were not supported by the testimony from the
witness stand and deprived him of adequate notice. The ALJ permitted the modifications and
found, “[t]he amended charges were not altered in any significant way such that [Dr. Williams]
could not defend against them.” As a result, the ALJ also found that the amended charges, with
or without the State’s modifications, provided Dr. Williams with sufficient notice of the charges
against him. In his exceptions, Dr. Williams argues that the ALJ erred by permitting the State to
amend the factual allegations in the charges, claiming that it deprived him of the notice required
for due process.

The Panel has reviewed the modifications made to the amended charges. All the
modifications made during the hearing pertain to Patient 1. In light of the fact that the Panel did
not find a violation as to Patient 1, the modifications made to the amended charges have no
impact on the Panel’s final decision and order in this case. As such, the modifications to the
amended charges are irrelevant and the Panel need not address whether Dr. Williams was

provided sufficient notice to comport with due process. Dr. Williams’s exception is denied.
