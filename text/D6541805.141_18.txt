application for licensure or any other application related to the practice of medicine, in violation
of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(36).
SANCTION

The ALJ recommended the revocation of the Respondent’s license, noting, “[n]o mitigating
factors are present,” and “[a]ll the aggravating factors are present.” Most significantly, the ALJ
found the “Respondent’s prescription methods had no relationship whatsoever to patient welfare.”
The ALJ also mentioned that each of the seven disciplinary grounds violated, standing alone,
subjects the Respondent to the possible sanction of revocation. And “[c]ollectively the violations,
in conjunction with the Respondent’s history of sanctions and failure of rehabilitation, warrant
revocation of the Respondent’s license.”

The Respondent took exception to the ALJ’s recommended sanction. Essentially, the
Respondent argues that the Panel should prohibit him from prescribing CDS (which he states has
already occurred through his surrender of his DEA registration) and impose a period of suspension.
He says that his “acceptance of errors and surrender of his CDS license” constitute a mitigating
factor and that he should concentrate on internal medicine. He also claims that “the CDC Response
of April 10, 2019 clarifying the CDC guidelines mitigates any perceived conduct by Dr. Ojiegbe
in CDS prescriptions” for the 20 patients at issue in this case.

It is apparent to Panel A that the Respondent was more than willing to prescribe high
potency CDS to individuals exhibiting the blatant signals that the prescriptions were for abuse or
diversion. The Panel cannot fathom how his conduct was not deliberate. Moreover, the
Respondent has shown little to no acknowledgment as to the nature of his egregious conduct and,
thus, the Panel cannot allow the Respondent to continue to abuse a medical license and jeopardize

the health and safety of his patients and the public.
