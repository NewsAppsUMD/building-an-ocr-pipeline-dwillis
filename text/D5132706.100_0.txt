Re: Fidelis Doh, M.D.
Case No.: 2219-0156 & 2220-0260
License No.: D51327

Dear Dr. Doh and Mr. Malizio:

On May 26, 2020, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued
an ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE in
this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl. Vol.). On June
10, 2020, Dr. Doh was given an opportunity to attend a hearing before Disciplinary Panel A to
show cause why that suspension should not be continued. Dr. Doh attended the hearing on that
date with counsel. The State was represented by Adam Malizio, Assistant Attorney General,
Administrative Prosecutor. At the post-deprivation hearing counsel for Dr. Doh stated that Dr.
Doh consented to the continuation of the summary suspension. Accordingly, the parties did not
present any arguments.

Disciplinary Panel A, having considered the investigative information in this case,
continues to believe that the public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires the summary
suspension of Dr. Doh’s medical license with the meaning of Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-
226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl. Vol.). Disciplinary Panel A thus will not lift the summary suspension
order and the summary suspension imposed on May 26, 2020 is affirmed and continues. See
COMAR 10.32.02.08H(1).
