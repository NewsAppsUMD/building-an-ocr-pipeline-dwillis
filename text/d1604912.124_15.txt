4. Dr. Egbert’s Conduct was Unprofessional because it does not Include
Protective Safeguards Required by States that Permit Physician Assisted
Suicide.

Dr. Egbert’s practices violate the strict protective standards to minimize the potential for
abuse required in states that permit assisted suicide. In his expert report, Dr. Silverman noted
that states that allow physician assisted suicide require a psychiatric consultation to ensure
existence of a rational decision. Dr. Egbert and FEN do not have such a consultation to ensure
rational decisions by the FEN applicant or member.

Dr. Egbert and FEN also ignore the strict requirement by states that permit assisted
suicide that limit such practice only to terminal patients. Oregon, Washington and Vermont, the
three states that have passed laws permitting physician assisted suicide, each limit physician
assisted suicide to patients suffering from terminal disease. See 18 Vt. Stat. Ann. § 5281
(terminal disease is defined as “an incurable and irreversible disease which would, within
reasonable medical judgment, result in death within six months”); Or. Rev. Stat. 127.800 §1.01
(defining terminal disease as “incurable and irreversible disease that has been medically
confirmed and will, within reasonable medical judgment, produce death within six months”);
Wash. Rev. Code § 70.245.010 (same). Vermont specifies that “a bona fide physician—patient
relationship with a patient with a terminal condition shall not be considered to have engaged in
unprofessional conduct” under certain limited circumstances. 18 Vt. Stat. Ann. § 5289
(emphasis added). Oregon and Washington requires the attending physician to “[mJake the
initial determination of whether a patient has a terminal disease .. .” Or. Rev. Stat. 127.815 §

3.01; Wash. Rev. Code 70.245.040 (using identical language).°

> This does not mean to suggest that had Dr. Egbert complied with the other states’ laws that his actions

would be legal or professional in Maryland.
