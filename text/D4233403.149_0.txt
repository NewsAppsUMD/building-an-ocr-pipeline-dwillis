Case No.: 2219-0016A
License No.: D42334

Dear Dr. Jalali and Counsel:

On March 8, 2019, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann.,
State Gov’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl. Vol.).

On March 13, 2019, Disciplinary Panel A held a post deprivation hearing to show cause
why that suspension should not be continued. Neither you, or your counsel, Robert Maynard,
Esq, attended the hearing on that date on your behalf. Mr. Maynard sent a message to Ms. Brown
and to the Board’s Executive Director informing them that you would not be attending the post
deprivation hearing. The State was represented by Janet Brown, Assistant Attorney General,
Administrative Prosecutor. Ms. Brown presented oral arguments at the hearing on behalf of the
State.

After considering Ms. Brown’s arguments at the hearing and the investigative file,
Disciplinary Panel A determined that it would continue the summary suspension imposed on
March 8, 2019. Disciplinary Panel A thus will not lift the summary suspension order.

Disciplinary Panel A finds that the public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires the
suspension of Dr. Jalali’s license. See State Gov’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i). The order of summary
