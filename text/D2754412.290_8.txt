employee complaints that were made against the Respondent
regarding his sexual behavior. '?

She witnessed the Respondent’s sexual behavior directed toward
Individual D.

In February 2020, the Practice’s legal counsel requested that she
document information regarding sexual harassment at the Practice,
including the names of individuals who had reported the Respondent.
She complied and shortly thereafter the Practice suspended her
employment.!?

On June 16, 2020, Board investigators interviewed an administrative

employee at the Practice from 2010 until 2018 (“Individual F’”). In the under-oath

interview, Individual F stated:

The Respondent saw her once as a patient after he insisted that he treat
her for migraines. When conducting his examination, the Respondent
stared at her breasts.

In 2016, she discussed a legal matter with the Respondent, who stated
that he could assist her. The Respondent offered to meet her to further
discuss the matter, took her to a secluded area in a park, grabbed her
arms and repeatedly tried to kiss her. After she declined the
Respondent’s sexual advances, the Respondent stopped offering
assistance with her legal matter.

After she reported the incident to other Practice employees, including
Individual D and Individual E, the Respondent never spoke to her
again. She was also asked to leave the Practice, offered a severance
package and asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement.

? Individual E discussed the names and allegations that were reported to her, including those reported by
Individuals A, C, D and F. Individual E was also aware of Individual B’s allegations and that the Practice
instituted a chaperone policy specifically for the Respondent shortly thereafter.

9 Individual E was told that her employment at the Practice was suspended based on allegations that she
mishandled medical records.
