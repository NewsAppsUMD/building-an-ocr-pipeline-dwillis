commerce, certain writings, signs, signals, and sounds for the purpose of executing the scheme or
artifice.” Fraud is an essential element of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The facts of the guilty
plea also demonstrate that Dr. Raley was intentionally dishonest for purposes of personal gain,
which also supports the conclusion that he pled guilty to a crime involving moral turpitude.
Walman, 280 Md. at 459-60.

Upon determining that a licensee has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude,
Health Occ. § 14-404(b)(2) requires a disciplinary panel to order the revocation of a license after
the appellate proceedings have been completed.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Based on the above findings of fact and discussion, Panel B concludes that Dr. Raley’s
convictions for conspiracy to receive health care kickbacks, 18 U.S.C. § 371, and conspiracy to
commit wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 1349, are crimnes involving moral turpitude. As a result, Health
Occ. § 14-404(b)(2) requires Panel B to order the revocation of Dr. Raley’s medical license.

ORDER

It is, by Board Disciplinary Panel B, hereby:

ORDERED that the license of Thomas J. Raley, M.D., license number D68746, to
practice medicine in Maryland is REVOKED, as mandated by Health Occ. § 14-404(b)(2); and
it is further

ORDERED that this is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT. See Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 1-

607, 14-411.1(b)(2) and Gen. Prov. § 4-333(b)(6).
