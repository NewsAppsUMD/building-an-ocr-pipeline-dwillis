her and placed his hand near her vagina.

Respondent did not reply. Instead, he inserted his fingers in her vagina for
several seconds.

The Respondent did not explain why he was touching Patient 3 in this manner.
After removing his fingers from Patient 3’s vagina, the Respondent left the room
without speaking to Patient 3.

Patient 3 was shocked and upset.

Patient 3 had her husband accompany her to her next appointment with the
Respondent, on February 12, 2014. Patient 3 attempted to discuss with the
Respondent why he had touched her as he had because she still felt dirty and
violated, but was unable to.

accompanied by a family member because she did not feel comfortable with him.

concerns regarding the Respondent's conduct with Physician 4.’
