IL Consent Order

3, On January 6, 2020, in order to resolve the pending charges, the Respondent
and Panel A agreed to a Consent Order (the “Consent Order”), which, among other things,
reprimanded the Respondent and ordered that within 30 days from the date of the Consent
Order the Respondent submit to the Board for Board approval: (1) a letter to the
complainant patients listed in the Consent Order stating that the Respondent closed his
medical practice in August 2018 and has destroyed all medical records that were not
already obtained by the patients (the “Letter”); and (2) a newspaper advertising notice for
publication stating that the Respondent closed his medical practice in August 2018 and that
he has destroyed all medical records that were not already obtained by patients (the
“Notice”; the Letter and the Notice will collectively be referred to as the “Documents”).
The Consent Order further ordered that within 30 days after the approval of the Letter and
the Notice from the Board, the Respondent shall: (1) publish the Notice for two consecutive

weeks in a daily newspaper that is circulated locally in the area of his former medical

Respondent’s license expiration was, thus, extended. This order terminates the extension given to the
Respondent as a result of the discipline imposed.
