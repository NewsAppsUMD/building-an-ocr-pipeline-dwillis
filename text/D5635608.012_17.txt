actually led the Court of Special Appeals to “reverse[ ] the Board’s finding that summary
suspension was ‘imperatively required.’” Mullan, 381 Md. at 162.

The approach taken by the Court of Special Appeals was the same taken by the ALJ in
the Respondent’s case. The Court of Special Appeals had found that the lack of complaints
between complaint to the Board and the order to summarily suspend “vitiated” any evidence that
the order for summary suspension was imperatively required. Mullan, 381 Md. at 161-62. The
Court of Appeals, in Mullan, then reversed the Court of Special Appeals, rejecting the reasoning
of the Court of Special Appeals. Jd. at 173. Thus, Mullan specifically rejects the approach and
reasoning applied by the ALJ in the Respondent’s case.

The Court of Appeals, in Mullan, explained why Dr. Mullan continued to pose a danger
requiring order for summary suspension despite there being only one day in which it was proven
that he saw patients while intoxicated:

When a pediatrician, with a history of severe alcoholism, renders

medical care to children while visibly intoxicated, he exhibits a

remarkable lack of sound judgment by his failure to decide not to see

patients on that day, even if he could not refrain from using alcohol.

Such a lack of sound judgment is sufficient evidence for a reasonable

Board to conclude the incident might repeat itself, requiring immediate

suspension of the doctor’s license and posing a danger that imperatively

requires emergency action.
Mullan, 381 Md. at 173. The Respondent demonstrated his remarkable lack of sound judgment
by his long-term sexual harassment and offensive touching.

The real difference between Mullan and the Respondent’s case is that Mullan
demonstrated his poor judgment on one day, while the Respondent’s deleterious behavior and

remarkable lack of sound judgment at the Hospital was evident on numerous occasions over the

course of years.
