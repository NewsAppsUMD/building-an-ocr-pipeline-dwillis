2019 and October 14, 2019, MPRP notified the Board that Dr. Yacoub had violated the terms of
his Rehabilitation Agreement? While Dr. Yacoub claimed that his violation was unintentional,

he did not challenge the fact that he violated the Order of Reinstatement less than a month after

being reinstated.

Show Cause Hearing

On January 30, 2020, Panel B issued a Violation of Board Order and Notice to Show
Cause, alleging a violation of the terms and conditions of the September 3, 2019 Order of
Reinstatement for failing to comply with the terms of the Rehabilitation Agreement he entered
into with MPRP.

On May 27, 2020, Dr. Yacoub appeared at a show cause hearing before Panel B. During
the hearing, Dr. Yacoub admitted that there were two violations of his Rehabilitation Agreement,
even though he claimed that the violations were unintentional. He stated that he was committed
to MPRP and would comply with any conditions imposed by the Panel.

In response, the Administrative Prosecutor recapped Dr. Yacoub’s lengthy disciplinary
history with the Board and emphasized that Dr. Yacoub was already given a second chance when
the Panel agreed to reinstate his license. The Administrative Prosecutor asked the Panel to
revoke Dr, Yacoub’s license.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Panel B finds that Dr. Yacoub violated the terms of the probation imposed by the

September 3, 2019 Order of Reinstatement with Conditions by failing to comply with the

requirements of the Rehabilitation Agreement he entered into with MPRP.

* The nature of Dr. Yacoub’s violations is confidential.
