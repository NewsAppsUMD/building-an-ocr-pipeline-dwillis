DISCUSSION

The Board alleged that the Respondent failed to meet appropriate standards as determined
by peer review for the delivery of quality medical care and that his conduct was unprofessional
in connection with his treatment of Patient A on February 28, 2014 and March 1, 2014. Md.
Code Ann., Health Occ. ยง 14-404(a) (3)(ii), (22) (Supp. 2015).

The State argued that the Respondent failed to meet the quality standard of care and was
unprofessional when he delivered a twenty-eight to twenty-nine week old stillborn fetus in an
outpatient office without the assistance of any licensed staff or the ability to perform surgery if
needed. The State asserted that the standard of quality care required that the Respondent refer
Patient A to a higher level of care facility, such as a labor and delivery unit at a hospital or an
ambulatory surgical care center. The State maintained that the advanced fetal age meant the
fetus was larger and would be more difficult to deliver and there would be a higher risk of
infection and excessive bleeding. The State contended that the articles relied upon by the
Respondent described outpatient facilities with special surgical instruments, specially trained
staff, and a community hospital located across the street from the facility. In contrast, the State
noted the Respondent testified that his medical office was approximately ten minutes from the

closest hospitals, he did not have hospital privileges, and his emergency plan was to call 911.
