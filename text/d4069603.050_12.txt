physically uncomfortable. I didn’t make eye contact with him, I did not talk to him, J did
not go to his office.” In response to the Respondent’s claim that an incident occurred with

Employee B

17. Employee B confirmed that she also filed a complaint to the Facility about
the Respondent, stating that she felt threatened and unsafe around him due to his
unwelcome, overly personal comments about her appearance. Employee B stated that she
felt threatened by the Respondent’s comments to her when she would not reply to his
messages and that she feared retaliation. Employee B alleged that the Respondent: sent her
inappropriate text messages after hours; sent her a Facebook message on August 9, 2015
at 12:03 a.m., stating, “Wow, your pic. Ifwe weren’t married .. . damn!”; replied to a
message, consisting of a “thumbs-up” emoji she accidently sent to him on October 25,
2017, by stating, “It’s always nice to hear from beautiful women”; asked her whether she
was planning to visit a nude bar during a trip to Key West and then described how he would
like to open an imaging center where female radiology technicians would work topless;
made inappropriate comments to radiology employees at another Facility worksite; and
disclosed personal issues to her.

18. Employee B stated that she began working with the Respondent in 2012 and
was immediately taken aback by his demeanor. Specifically, she stated that the Respondent
made “a lot of dirty jokes mostly related to women in a sexual way, just comments, in

general commenting on even patients sometimes about their attractiveness or lack thereof.”
