claim, not to make a complaint against the Respondent. Furthermore, Patient 2 did not impress
me as an individual who would be so calculating that she would falsely accuse a physician,
endangering his livelihood for no valid-reason, simply to enhance a disability claim. When
Patient 2 testified on November 15, 2016 and started crying when reliving what the Respondent

sexual misconduct by a physician, as defined by COMAR 10.32.17.02(B)(3)(b), in turn,
constitutes immoral and unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, subjecting the
Respondent to disciplinary action against his medical license under section 14-404(a)(3)(i) and
Gi) of the Act.

hour a day regimen of pain medication through a catheter inserted into her spine. Despite having
this pump, Patient 3 still needed to seek treatment for back pain. She also needed to have a
physician provide refills of her medication for her intrathecal pump.

Before becoming the Respondent’s patient, Patient 3 received pain management

treatment that Patient 3 was obtaining from an outside medical provider. In June 2011, Patient 3
