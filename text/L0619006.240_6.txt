I. Background

1. At all relevant times, the Respondent has been licensed to practice as a
respiratory care practitioner in the State of Maryland. The Respondent was first licensed
to practice as a respiratory care practitioner in Maryland on or about March 5, 2014, under
License Number L06910. His license is active through May 30, 2020.

2. On or about August 8, 2018, the Board received a Mandated 10-Day Report
from a Maryland hospital (the “Hospital”)* that reported the Respondent had resigned from
the Hospital in lieu of termination on or about August 2, 2018.

3. According to the Mandated 10-Day Report, on or about July 18, 2018, the
Respondent manufactured and applied a device to a patient that was “without approval or
backing by hospital policy or any known best practice.” The Report explained that the
Respondent was called to evaluate a patient (the “Patient”) with a possible endotracheal
tube (“ETT”) cuff leak, and, while waiting for the anesthesia team to arrive and replace the
ETT, the Respondent “combined a 10 cc syringe, suction adapter, tape and oxygen
connective tubing to flow | [liter per minute] of continuous oxygen into the pilot balloon
of the cuff.” The Report then explained that the anesthesia team replaced the Patient’s ETT
four times, with the first two ETTs having ruptured or blown cuffs upon removal. The
anesthesia team, according to the Report, conducted “bench testing” and believed that the
device the Respondent made and applied to the ETTs caused the cuffs to rupture inside the
Patient’s trachea. The Patient was later found to have a large tracheal tear requiring

emergency surgical repair.
