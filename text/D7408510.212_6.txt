allowed this to happen, and I take full responsibility for it. I don’t have any excuses for
what I did, and I don’t pretend to provide any, but I can provide some background.”

28. The Respondent explained that he has had several issues lately that have
created a lot of stress and anxiety in his life. He stated, “I was overwhelmed. I was having
panic attacks, anxiety attacks, I just kept thinking about that over and over.”

29, The Respondent acknowledged that he began drinking at approximately 2:00
p.m. on April 4, 2022 and continued throughout the day and into the morning hours of
April 5, 2022. The Respondent stated:

I started drinking on Monday afternoon, which was the 4th, I had tried to get

through the entire weekend and was having a lot of flashbacks, a lot of panic.

And starting Monday afternoon, I came home, and I would say over the

course of Monday afternoon to Tuesday morning, drank a bottle of wine...

Thad a glass, I was exhausted. I went to bed. I woke up—at this point things

are hazy, so I’m not going to—unfortunately, I don’t know the exact timeline,

but I remember waking up throughout the course of the night and still just

being in a panic and have another glass, have another glass. The last glass

that I had was about 3:00 in the morning.

30. The Respondent admitted that when he woke up for his shift at 5:00 a.m. on
April 5, 2022, he felt under the influence. The details of the day are “hazy” for him, but he
recalls doing “pediatric gastroenterology patients, kids’ colonoscopies or endoscopies.” He
stated, “I don’t recall exactly what my interactions were. I know I was helping the other
physician with the cases. On the second case that we did I started a peripheral IV.” He
believes that he was taken out of the room after starting the second case and directed to go
to the office and later to the urgent care.

31. As a result of this relapse, the Respondent offered to undergo treatment

measures to address his medical condition.
