. Reinstatement Application, the Credentialing Application, and the 2017 Renewal Application
reflect a clear pattern of dishonesty, as well as a willingness to put self-interest before

the Respondent deceptively obtained his licensure, is guilty of unprofessional conduct in the
practice’ of medicine, and willfully made false representatiods on his licensure applications and
Credentialing Application, in violation of section 15-314(a)(1), 3)Gi), and (36) of the-Health -
