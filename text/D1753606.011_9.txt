whether Dr. Salihi was mentally competent to practice medicine. The Panel, like the ALJ, relies
mainly on the expert reports and opinions of the two doctors who testified at OAH and were
accepted as experts of the ALJ. The Panel gives little weight to the testimony of the fact witnesses
who testified on Dr. Salihi’s behalf.

Dr. Salihi’s exceptions are denied.
I. Summary Suspension

Dr. Salihi did not file exceptions to the ALJ’s conclusion that the summary suspension of
his license was proper because the public health, safety, or welfare imperatively required
emergency action. In any event, Panel B agrees with the ALJ’s conclusion that the summary
suspension was proper.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Panel B concludes that Dr. Salihi is mentally incompetent, in violation of Health Occ. §
14-404(a)(4), and that the summary suspension was proper because the public health, safety, or
welfare imperatively required emergency action pursuant to State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2).

SANCTION

The ALJ recommended that Dr. Salihi’s license be suspended until the time when he
provides information to the Board to establish that he is mentally competent to resume the practice
of medicine. The State took exception to the ALJ’s proposed sanction and argues that the Panel
should impose a revocation of Dr. Salihi’s license instead of a suspension due to the permanency
of Dr. Salihi’s condition and the unlikely possibility that Dr. Salihi will regain competence in the
future. The Panel agrees with the State that it is unlikely that Dr. Salihi’s condition will improve
and that he will regain competence, but if Dr. Salihi does regain competence, the Panel will

consider an application for reinstatement after a minimum of one year.
