â€œhe is known to use heroin."

8. EMS personnel administered naloxone to the Respondent and transported
him to the ED of the Hospital for further evaluation. Upon arrival to the ED, the
Respondent was hypoxic, vomited, and had to be suctioned. ED records state that
EMS personnel found the Respondent with a needle by his side.

9. ED personnel administered naloxone to the Respondent. Shortly
thereafter, the Respondent began cursing at, and became belligerent, threatening,
confrontational and aggressive toward, Hospital staff. At one point, the Respondent
stated to a staff member that he was a physician in Georgia and that he "came to
Maryland to get high." The Respondent removed cardiac monitor leads and other
monitoring equipment, pulled out his intravenous line, engaged in aggressive and
abusive behavior toward a staff member, and made racial epithets toward her.

10. During the course of his ED admission, the Respondent made aggressive,
sexually demeaning and violent comments against staff members who were attempting
to attend to him. The Respondent refused all diagnostic testing, except for a chest x-
ray, and told a physician, "if you don't have any labs, you don't have any proof."
Hospital staff asked the Respondent to provide a urine specimen, whereupon the
Respondent filled the specimen container with water.

11. An individual who identified herself as a close family member of the
Respondent stated that she found the Respondent at the motel, that he had a history of

drug abuse, had used heroin and had overdosed prior to the arrival of EMS personnel.
