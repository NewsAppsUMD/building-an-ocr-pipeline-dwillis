PROPOSED DEFAULT ORDER

On June 7, 2018, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland Board of Physicians (Board) issued
Charges under the Maryland Physician Assistants Act against Cassandra Burns-Ross, PA-C
(Respondent), License No. C01009, Md. Code Ann., Health Oce, §§ 15-101 through 15-502
(2014 & Supp. 2018): Specifically; the Board charged the Respondent with violating three sections
of the Act: § 15-314(a)(1) (fraudulently or deceptively obtaining a license); § 15-314(a)(3)
(unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine); and § 15-3 14(a)(36) (willfully making a false
representation when making an application for licensure). The charges stem from the Respondent's
alleged failure to disclose on various license applications, including her initial application for
licensure in 1986, her 1971 conviction in New York for attempted manslaughter in the second
degree.

On September 14, 2018, the Board delegated this matter to the Office of Administrative

Hearings (OAH) to conduct a hearing and to issue proposed findings of fact and conclusions of

law and a proposed disposition.
