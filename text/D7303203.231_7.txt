Each month the supervisor shal/ review the patient records, chosen
by the supervisor, of at least 10 of the Respondent’s patients for whom
the Respondent is prescribing opioids. The supervisor shall meet in-
person with the Respondent at least one time each month...
[Emphasis added]. .

On May 15, 2020, the Respondent’s supervisor (the “Supervisor”) submitted to the
Board her 3" quarterly report of the second ycar of her supervision of the
Respondent (the “May 2020 Report”).

The Supervisor noted:

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, March — May 2020, | have remotely
supervised Dr. Okoli’s management of chronic pain patients by
checking the Maryland Prescription Monitoring Program to determine
whether his opioid-prescribing habits have indeed changed and
whether he had complied with my recommendation from my January
20" visit. At that visit, I advised Dr. Okoli to cease all prescribing of
scheduled drugs such as opioids and benzodiazepines...My last face-
to-face supervisory visit was on February 22, 2020. (Emphasis in
original).

By email dated August 26, 2020, the Supervisor advised the Board that after
February 2020, the Respondent and she “have been meeting via phone multiple
times a month to discuss his opioid prescribing practices and his previous month’s
PDMP reports.”

The Respondent failed to ensure that his Supervisor reviewed the complete medical
records of patients selected for review, as he was required to do under Condition |

of the 2018 Consent Order.
