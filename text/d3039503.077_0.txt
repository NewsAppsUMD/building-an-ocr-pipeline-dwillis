FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
Procedural History

On August 16, 2016, Disciplinary Panel B (“Panel B”) of the Maryland State Board of
Physicians (the “Board”) charged the Respondent Richard C. Matzkin, M.D. under the Maryland
Medical Practice Act, Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. §§ 14-101—14-702, with unprofessional
conduct in the practice of medicine, see Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii); failure to meet the
appropriate standards for quality medical care, see Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(22); and failure to
maintain adequate medical records, see Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(40). The charges were based on
the Respondent’s treatment of two patients. Panel B notified the Respondent that if there were
grounds for action, disciplinary sanctions could be imposed against his license. On October 4,
2016, the Board referred this case to OAH for an evidentiary hearing.

After notice to the Respondent and the State, OAH held a Scheduling Conference on
November 3, 2016, at 9:30 am. at OAH in Hunt Valley, Maryland. The Respondent did not
appear for the Scheduling Conference and no one appeared on his behalf. The State was
represented by the Administrative Prosecutor from the Maryland Office of the Attorney General,
who appeared at the conference. After waiting more than 15 minutes for the Respondent to

appear, the ALJ proceeded with the Scheduling Conference in his absence. COMAR
