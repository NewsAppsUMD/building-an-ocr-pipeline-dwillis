il. BOARD INVESTIGATION

5. As a result of the Boardâ€™s investigation, it determined that at certain points
in time from June 1, 2010, through June 10, 2016, the Respondent permitted unlicensed
individuals to perform medical acts and procedures that included performing regional
blocks, ordering radiographs and laboratory tests in clinical settings and dictating patient
medical records.

6. On or about February 2, 2017, Board investigators interviewed the
Respondent at the Board's offices. The Respondent admitted that the unlicensed

individuals performed medical acts and procedures.

7. During the interview, a Board investigator asked the Respondent about
the types of patient contact the unlicensed individuals had, and the Respondent stated:

When | was working with them I'm teaching them. They
would assist me initially by just being there, you know, retracting,
doing anything. And then as | saw what their skill level really was, |
would then let them do some of the dissection to prepare things for
me. Then we reach a point where | took over on every single
surgery.
