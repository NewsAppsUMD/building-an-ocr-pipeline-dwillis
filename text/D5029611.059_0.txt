Re: Surrender of License to Practice Medicine
Shastine Abate, M.D, License Number; D50296
Case Number: 7719-0086

Dear Dr. Bhandari and Members of the Disciplinary Panel A,

Please be advised that, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. (“Health Occ.”)
§14-403 (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2017 Supp.), I have decided to SURRENDER my license to
practice medicine in the State of Maryland, License Number D50296, effective
December 31, 2019, I understand that upon surrender of my license, I may not give
medical advice or treatment to any individual, with or without compensation, and cannot
prescribe medications or otherwise engage in the practice of medicine in the State of
Maryland as it is defined in the Maryland Medical Practice Act (the “Act”), Health Occ.
§§ 14-101 er seq. and other applicable laws, In other words, as of the effective date of this
Letter of Surrender, I understand that the surrender of my license means that I am in the
same position as an unlicensed individual in the State of Maryland.

I understand that this Letter of Surrender is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT, and upon
Disciplinary Panel A’s (“Panel A”) acceptance, becomes a FINAL ORDER of Panel A
of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”),

I acknowledge that the Board initiated an investigation of my practice and on
January 3, 2019, Panel A issued disciplinary charges against me under Health Occ. § 14-
404(a)(3)(ii). Specifically, Panel A alleged that I failed to properly secure my medical
office and that I dismissed the Complainant and her family members as patients because
of her complaint to the Board. I resolved the disciplinary charges through entering into 9
Consent Order with Panel A, dated March 26, 2019 (the “Consent Order”), in which
Panel A found that I violated Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)Gi) (unprofessional conduct in
the practice of medicine), Pursuant to the Consent Order, I was reprimanded and placed
on probation for a minimum of one (1) year with certain terms and conditions including
that I successfully complete a course in appropriate physician-patient relations. A copy of
the Consent Order is attached and incorporated herein as Attachment 1.

I have decided to surrender my license to practice medicine in the State of
Maryland because I no longer wish to comply with the terms of the Consent Order,
including taking a course in appropriate physician-patient relations, and due to my
