abdominal issues during this visit, but said she is a girl who could have menstrual issues at her age,
and he believed she may have had complainis in the past about irritable bowel syndrome, so it was a
standard procedure for him to perform an abdominal examination.

Respondent provide a written response to the Patient’s allegations, The Respondent submitted a

attack while I was examining her.” (/d, at bates 000185).
