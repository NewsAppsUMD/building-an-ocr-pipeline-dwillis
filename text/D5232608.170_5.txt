State took exception to the ALJ’s proposed sanction and asked the Panel to impose a sanction of a
reprimand, thirty-day suspension, eighteen months of probation with enrollment in the Maryland
Professional Rehabilitation Program, and a $10,000.00 fine. Dr. Lightfoot responds that the Panel
should adopt the sanction proposed by the ALJ and argues that any period of suspension is
excessive and unwarranted.

The Panel recognizes, as the ALJ did, that Dr. Lightfoot’s boundary violation was limited
to a single patient, but it was by no means an isolated incident. Dr. Lightfoot treated and prescribed
medications to Patient 1, including CDS, on seven occasions in the Emergency Department and
on four occasions outside of the emergency department. After the seventh time that Patient 1
showed up to the emergency department, Dr. Lightfoot recognized there was a pattern involved in
Patient 1 seeking prescriptions from him. The Panel agrees with the ALJ that Dr. Lightfoot
exhibited serious lapses in professionalism in this case and that his conduct can be remediated.
The Panel also agrees with the State that a brief period of suspension is warranted in this case to
demonstrate the importance of maintaining professional boundaries. The Panel, therefore, will
impose a 5-day suspension followed by a period of probation with a referral to the Maryland
Professional Rehabilitation Program and a course in professional boundaries. The Panel will also
impose a civil fine of $10,000.
