 

THE AMA CODE OF MEDICAL ETHICS

The American Medical Association (“AMA”) Code of Medical Ethics provides in
pertinent part:

Opinion 8.19 — Self-treatment or Treatment of Immediate Family Members
Physicians generally should not treat themselves or members of their immediate
families. Professional objectivity may be compromised when an immediate
family member or the physician is the patient; the physician's personal feelings
may unduly influence his or her professional medical judgment, thereby
interfering with the care being delivered. Physicians may fail to probe sensitive
areas when taking the medical history or may fail to perform intimate parts of the
physical examination...When treating themselves or immediate family members,
physicians may be inclined to treat problems that are beyond their expertise or
training.

...Concerns regarding patient autonomy and informed consent are also relevant

when physicians attempt to treat members of their immediate family. Family

members may be reluctant to state their preferences for another physician or
decline a recommendation for fear of offending the physician...
