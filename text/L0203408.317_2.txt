Il. THE COMPLAINT

Health Care Worker A

4. On or about November 17, 2016, the Board received a complaint from a
manager (the "Complainant") of a respiratory care staffing company who reported that
the Respondent, a respiratory care practitioner the company employed, sexually
harassed and assaulted Health Care Worker A, a respiratory care practitioner and co-
worker, at Health Care Facility A, where they were assigned. Health Care Facility A is
located in Maryland.

5. The Complainant reported that Health Care Worker A submitted a written
statement to him in which she reported that the Respondent sexual assaulted her at
Health Care Facility A on November 13, 2016. The Complainant also interviewed
Health Care Worker A about the incident. The Complainant reported that on this date,
the Respondent "forced himselfâ€™ on Health Care Worker A while they were in a patient's
room, restrained her from getting away, expressed his attraction for her and then
sexually assaulted her. The Complainant reported that Health Care Worker A
attempted to resist the Respondent's assault, after which she was able to leave the
patient's room and avoided him during the remainder of her shift. The Complainant
reported that after the Respondent sexually assaulted her, he apologized, stated it
would not happen again and asked her not to tell anyone about what he had done.

6. The Complainant stated that after receiving this report, he confronted the
Respondent about Health Care Worker A's allegations. The Complainant stated that
the Respondent acknowledged the truth of the allegations Health Care Worker A made

in her report. The Complainant reported that the Respondent stated he was "very sorry"
