The Respondent said that the inner voice is not that of the Patient, it diminishes lier
creativity, and it is good to ignore her internal judge.

her out of the examination room,

The Patient walked past the reception desk and no one was there, The computer
screens were black, The Patient asked, ‘where is everyone?” (Bd. Ex,.# 3, bates no,
000005). The Respondent responded but the Patient could not make out what he was
saying, He continued to talk about the Patient shadowing him in the future for
clinical hours, because the Patient had expressed interest in becoming.a physician
assistarit, The Respondent stated that she would have to spend many hours with him
if she were to shadow.

The Patient opened the front door of the office and left.

father had texted her. She had not informed her father that she had the appointment

with the Respondent, and only totd him she was coming home from Frostburg, She

‘responded to her father’s text at 5:16 p.m. to tell him she was at the doctor’s office.

Then she drove home.
