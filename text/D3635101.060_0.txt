individual, with or without compensation, and cannot prescribe medications or otherwise engage
in the practice of medicine in the State of Maryland as it is defined in the Maryland Medical
Practice Act (the “Act”), Health Occ. §§ 14-101 ef seq. and other applicable laws. [n other words,

my license means that I am in the same position as an unlicensed individual in the State of
Maryland.
