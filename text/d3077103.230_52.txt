her request. However, given the fact that the Respondent was fully clothed, wearing an outer
coat and the conversation took place in a section of the hallway where no others persons were
present and the Respondent was complying with the request to show the source of the bleed, I do ,
not find that the Respondent's actions were unprofessional, immoral or sexual in nature. He
responded to a request to show a patient the source of a bleed. In context of the query, the
Respondent’s actions were reasonable given that the examination had just taken place. Had there
been a chart with a diagram, the Respondent’s actions may have been different.

With regard to peer review concerning the Respondent’s actions toward Individual F, the
Respondent argued the charges against him arising from Individual F should be dismissed
because the Board did noi conduct a peer review of his action. The State argues that it did not
regard the Respondent’s actions as a standard of care issue but viewed the allegation as
immoral/and or unprofessional conduct by a licensed physician. In this case, the Respondent is
not charged with violating sections 14-404(a)(22) (failing to meet appropriate standards for
delivery of medical and surgical care in an outpatient facility as determined by peer review) or
14-404(a)(40) (failing to keep adequate medical records), Peer review is statutorily required for
charges arising under section 14-404(a)(22) and 14-404(40), The Board is within its powers to
determine the charges against the Respondent and the charges alleged with respect to Individual

. Fdid not require peer review. Nevertheless, for the reasons stated-above, the Respondent has
not engaged in any behavior toward imdividual F that would support a finding of sexual,
immnoral and unprofessional misconduct in the practice of medicine, in violation of Section 14-
404(a)(3)(i) and (ii) of the Health Occupations Article and sexual misconduct, as prohibited by

COMAR 10.32.17.01 and .02B.
