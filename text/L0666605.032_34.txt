The 1 0-Day Report

The Board became aware of the Respondent’s potential license violations when)
filed a 10-Day Report.

The law requires the report as follows:

Except as provided in subsections (b) and (d) of this section, hospitals ... shall file

with the Board a report that the hospital ... terminated any licensed respiratory

care practitioner for any reasons that might be grounds for disciplinary action

under § 14-5A-17 of this subtitle.
Health Oce, § 14-5A-17(a).*®

BE stivica that he notified the Board because the Respondent resigned when
she was under consideration for termination for unprofessional and incompetent conduct. He
further testified that, in trainings conducted by the Board for hospital personnel, he learned that
the Board takes the position that a hospital should file a report if there is any question about
whether a report is required by law and leave the issue of whether an investigation is warranted
to the Board.

The Respondent argued that the 10-Day Report was filed in error because she had not
been terminated as of the date when it was filed. I conclude that the Respondent asked Eg

a: she was being terminated and he did not give her an answer or provide any advice

about whether it would be better for her to resign before she was terminated. The Respondent
did not seek dismissal of the Charges on this ground. I presume the argument is that, without the’
10-Day Report, the Board would have never learned of the Respondent’s difficulties at Ea

or opened an investigation.

56 The law was amended after the date of the August 15, 2019 10-Day Report. Those amendments are inapplicable
to this case.
