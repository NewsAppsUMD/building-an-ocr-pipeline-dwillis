also the same day, to the police, at a Board interview, and during her testimony at the hearing
before the ALJ. The ALJ found S.B.’s account credible and not exaggerated. In contrast, the
ALJ found Dr. Dalton not credible and found that his assistant was biased because she was a

long-time employee of Dr. Dalton.’

The ALJ heard live testimony from each of the witnesses
and accepted S.B.’s testimony as accurate. The Panel has carefully reviewed the testimony and
accepts the ALJ’s credibility determinations.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Unprofessional conduct includes conduct that is “unbecoming a member in good standing
of a profession.” Finucan v. Maryland Bd. of Physician Quality Assur., 380 Md. 577, 593
(2004). Here, there is no question Dr. Dalton’s conduct was unbecoming a member in good
standing of the medical profession.

Based on S.W.’s religious apparel, Dr. Dalton hectored her with inappropriate and
offensive queries on whether she agreed with the perpetrators of the San Bernardino shooting.
Dr. Dalton’s questioning of S.W. about her religious beliefs was offensive, demeaning, and
disturbing. His escalation, yelling that “there will be no jihad in this office,” is, of course, also
unacceptable. Dr. Dalton’s behavior was also physically threatening. He followed S.W. and
advanced toward her with his hand raised while screaming. Then he locked the patient in an
examination room away from his caregiver. His behavior is a clear case of unprofessional
conduct.

Then Dr. Dalton’s conduct got worse, considering his interaction with S.B. He yelled at

S.B., physically intimidated her, and physically pushed her, and pushed a wheelchair into her.

? The Panel does not accept the reasoning that “[Dr. Dalton] has a vested interest in downplaying the
negative aspects of his interactions with $.B.” ALJ Proposed Decision at 14. Dr. Dalton’s credibility
should not automatically be found to be diminished by his testifying on his own behalf.
