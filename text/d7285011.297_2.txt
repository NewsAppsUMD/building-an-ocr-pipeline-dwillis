The Board’s investigation raised concerns regarding the Respondent's current
ability to practice medicine in a safe and competent manner.2, On January 9,
2017, the Board issued to the Respondent a subpoena to be re-interviewed by
Board staff on January 27, 2017 at 12:00 p.m. In addition to the interview, Board
staff intended to hand-deliver to the Respondent a letter directing her to appear
at a toxicology screening facility immediately after the interview for a series of
screening tests.

On January 27, 2017 at approximately 9:30 a.m., Board staff received a
telephone call from the Respondent in which she questioned the need for a
follow-up Board interview. The Respondent told Board staff that she “did not see
the point in coming” and that she had felt “railroaded” during the first interview
because she was alone while being interviewed by two Board staff members.
Throughout the January 27, 2017 telephone call, the Respondent repeatedly
stated that she was not going to come to the interview later that day because she
did not feel comfortable. Board staff advised the Respondent that if she chose
not to appear for the interview, the Board may construe that as failure to
cooperate with a lawful Board investigation.

At one point during the telephone call, the Respondent told Board staff that she
had been out of town and did not receive the subpoena “until seven days ago.”
The Respondent requested the interview to be rescheduled.

A few minutes later, Board staff telephoned the Respondent to advise her that

her request to reschedule the interview had been denied. The Respondent
