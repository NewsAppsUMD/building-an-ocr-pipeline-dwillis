occasions when his intoxication was witnessed by people who documented the intoxication, the
evidence shows circumstantially, and the Panel infers, that there were many more occasions that
he was intoxicated. The ALJ unreasonably demanded the most exacting evidence for proof of
intoxication when the preponderance of the evidence decisively demonstrated intoxication on a
much larger scale than three isolated incidents. A finding of habitual intoxication was proven by
a preponderance of evidence.

c. Should the order of summary suspension be reversed?

The ALJ concluded that the Board panel did not violate the laws and regulations governing
summary suspensions by issuing the order of summary suspension of the Respondent’s medical
license on November 5, 2020. The ALJ, nonetheless, reversed the panel’s order of summary
suspension upon finding that, as of the dates of the evidentiary hearing before the Office of
Administrative Hearings, the Respondent did not present a substantial likelihood of risk of serious
harm to public health, safety, or welfare.

The State filed exceptions to the ALJ’s reversal of the order of summary suspension,
arguing that the issue before the ALJ was whether the summary suspension was properly issued
when it was issued on November 5, 2020, and not whether the summary suspension should remain
in effect based upon the Respondent’s condition at the time of the evidentiary hearing before the
ALJ.

The Respondent argues that ALJ correctly determined that the summary suspension order
should not be continued as of the date of evidentiary hearing before the ALJ.! In any event, the

Respondent filed with the Board a Petition to Reinstate his license.

' The Respondent also contends that the ALJ erred by finding that, when the summary
suspension was initially imposed, the summary suspension was justified.
