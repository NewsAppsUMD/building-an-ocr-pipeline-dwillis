as identified by the Program’s Assessment, the Panel is also not reassured that he is capable of
safe medical practice in critical care, internal medicine or in any setting,

Having considered the entire record in this case, including Dr. Mathur’s prior disciplinary
history, his violations of the March 4, 2020 Consent Order, his specific deficiencies identified by
the Program, his presentation before the Panel and responses to questions at the Show Cause
hearing, and the arguments from the Administrative Proseculor, Panel A concludes that
revocation of Dr, Mathur’s medical license is necessary to protect the public from his continued
practice.
