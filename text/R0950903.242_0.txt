Re: Krista Chastain, Radiographer
Case No.: 2222-0081
License No.: RO9509

Dear Ms. Chastain and Counsel:

On March 8, 2022, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
RADIOGRAPHY in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2). On
March 23, 2022, Ms. Chastain was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing
before Disciplinary Panel B to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. On
March 14, 2022, Ms. Chastain, through counsel, requested a postponement of the March 23,
2022, hearing due to her counsel being unavailable to attend, which was denied. Ms. Chastain
did not appear at the hearing and no counsel appeared on her behalf. The State was represented
by Gregory Lockwood, Assistant Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor.

After consideration of presentation from the State, Disciplinary Panel B determined, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the health, safety, and welfare of the public imperatively
required the disciplinary panel to summarily suspend Ms. Chastain’s license and there exists a
substantial risk of serious harm to the public health, safety, and welfare in Ms. Chastain’s
continued practice. Disciplinary Panel B thus will not lift the summary suspension order, and the
