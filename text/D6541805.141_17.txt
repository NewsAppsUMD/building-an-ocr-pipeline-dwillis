to 90 morphine milligram equivalents per day.” In any case, the Respondent does not address how
the 2019 CDC Clarification pertains to the Respondent’s failures with respect to his patients’
noncompliance and indicators of diversion.

For the reasons explained above, the Respondent violated Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(27).
Health Occ, § 14-404(a)(17) (Makes a willful misrepresentation in treatment)

The ALJ found that the Respondent violated Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(17). The Respondent
stated in his written exceptions that he excepts to that finding, however, the Respondent set forth

2011. For instance, his prescription pads falsely stated that he was board-certified in internal
medicine. The Respondent, thus, made a willful misrepresentation in treatment, in violation of
Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(17).
