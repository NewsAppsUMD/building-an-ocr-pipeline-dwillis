due to unethical and unprofessional behavior.” The Facility sent the Board a follow-up
Mandated 10-Day Report, dated October 2, 2020, which reported that it separated the
Respondent from employment on September 29, 2020 due to “unethical and unprofessional
conduct.”

IV. BOARD INVESTIGATION

Respondent’s letter, November 3, 2020

5. By letter dated October 26, 2020, the Board notified the Respondent that it
had opened an investigation of him after receiving information that he had been separated
from employment by the Facility on September 29, 2020. The Board requested that the
Respondent provide a written response to that information.

6. By letter to the Board dated November 3, 2020, the Respondent stated that
on September 29, 2020, the Facility “ended my employment of 20 years . . . largely as part
of their response to a Patient complaint received September 17, 2020. The body of the
complaint was objecting to topics of conversation while patient exam was performed, i.e.
politics, religion etc.” The Respondent added that “a similar complaint was registered via
internal corporate hotline by a fellow employee prior to this incident and I was issued a
warning by superiors about inappropriate topics of conversation in the workplace.” The
Respondent stated that he believed that the Facility was “not willing to tolerate another
policy violation and therefore to end my employment was the only recourse.”

Respondent’s Human Resources file

7, As part of its investigation, the Board acquired the Facility’s Human

Resources file on the Respondent, which documented two complaints against him.
