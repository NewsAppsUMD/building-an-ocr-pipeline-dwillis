13. On October 6, 2022, Board staff conducted an under-oath interview of the Director
of Sports Medicine at the College (“Supervisor”) who directly supervised the Respondent. He was
initially alerted to the Respondent’s concerning behaviors on or about August 12, 2022.

14. Several students and employees advised the Supervisor that the Respondent
frequently smelled of alcohol and was heard opening cans while in the stalls in the locker room.

15. On September 9, 2022, the Supervisor was again alerted to some concerning
behavior by the Respondent during a junior varsity game where she kept going up to the locker
room when there was no reason to do so. Another employee had also sent the Supervisor a photo
of the contents of the Respondent’s locker which included a brown paper Wawa bag full of empty
alcoholic beverage containers.

16. On September 12, 2022, the Supervisor inspected the women’s locker room and
found another separate plastic Wawa bag full of empty alcoholic beverage containers in the trash
along with a receipt with the Respondent’s name on it. They were the same empty containers in
the photo of the Respondent’s locker sent to the Supervisor on September 9, 2022. The Supervisor
reported this information to human resources the following day.

17. On September 13, 2022, the Supervisor arrived at the College early that morning to
find the Respondent walking out with the brown paper Wawa bag of empty containers which had
previously been found in her locker. The Supervisor also noticed that the Respondent’s car was
inappropriately parked in the middle of two adjoining parking spaces. The Supervisor asked the
Respondent if she was aware that she had parked in two spaces, and the Respondent advised that
she was not aware. She proceeded to discard the bag of empty cans in the trash and then moved

her car to an appropriate parking space.
