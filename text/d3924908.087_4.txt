TESTING

The Respondent tested his patients through a variety of procedures. The five tests at
issue are the Skin Prick Test (SPT), Patch Testing (PT), Spirometry (SP), Radioallergosorbent
Test (RAST), and the Open Food Challenge (OFC). Each of these is explained below.

SKIN PRICK TEST (SPT)

To identify a person’s allergic disorder, a physician can perform the SPT. Using a skin
puncture device, small amounts of allergens are loaded into pricks or needles which are then
pricked into the patient’s skin. A specific allergen is placed into an individual prick. Thus, if 40
allergens are tested, there are 40 pricks. After 15 to 20 minutes, the physician examines the skin.
A wheal (hive) response to a prick is indicative of an allergic disorder.

The allergens tested should be guided by the patient’s complaints and symptoms. The
SPT can test for “environmental allergens, such as dust, pollens, animal danders, things that are
inhaled, typically, . . . in the environment. And then there are other skins tests relevant to foods
causing symptoms, others to insect venoms.” (Tr. 120.) Positive and negative controls should
also be tested to ensure the validity of the interpretations. Unless there is a consequential change
in the patient’s condition, the SPT should not be repeated if the results of SPT are valid.

A patient should not take antihistamines and certain other medications for a period before
a SPT (generally three days, but it can be more depending on the half-life of the antihistamine).
A histamine test can determine the usefulness or validity of a SPT. A negative histamine
response means that the results of a SPT are, or would be, compromised by medication, such as
an antihistamine, which would interfere with the reactions to the allergens tested. Thus, patients
must be notified to discontinue antihistamines and certain other medications before a visit in

which a SPT will be performed. Tr. 64-65. If an SPT is invalidated or cancelled due to the
