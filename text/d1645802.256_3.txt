The Panel has also reviewed and considered additional exhibits proffered by Dr. Dooley.
As explained on pages 5-12, these exhibits do not alter Panel B’s findings in this case.

Dr. Dooley conceded at the exceptions hearing that he is not equipped to handle pain
management and stated that, as a result, he will not return to practicing pain management. Panel
B agrees that Dr. Dooley is not equipped to practice pain medicine.

There was a consistent pattern of substandard care throughout Dr. Dooley’s treatment of
Patients A-J. Dr. Dooley identified himself to Patients A-J as a pain management specialist,
despite the fact that he only had 19 hours of pain management training and was not Board
certified in pain medicine. Dr. Dooley ignored or was oblivious to major red flags, such as
patients requesting early prescription refills and reporting that prescriptions had been stolen. Dr.
Dooley did not conduct random urine toxicology screens or engage in random pill counting for
any of the ten patients and did not independently verify the medications the patients were taking
when they entered the practice. Dr. Dooley, for the most part, treated his chronic pain patients
using only short acting opioids without ever transitioning them to long acting opioids with short
acting opioids, as needed, for breakthrough pain. Dr. Dooley failed to utilize other treatment
options and, in many instances, failed to utilize non-opioid medications. Dr. Dooley’s chart
notes were largely repetitive across patient visits, had numerous typographical errors, and, in
many cases, lacked sufficient objective supporting documentation to support the patients’
subjective complaints of pain.
