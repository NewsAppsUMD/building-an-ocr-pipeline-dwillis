uncomfortable working with him.

reporting him out of fear of losing her job.

she was working and texting her personal cell phone. The Respondent
would make comments about her body and her attire. In one instance he
stated “for a skinny girl, you have a nice butt.”

The Respondent once telephoned her at work while he was sitting a short

The Respondent once followed her to her car while screaming her name.
She ran to her car and called a friend who worked in security and asked
him to meet her at her car so that she could hide for a few minutes.
