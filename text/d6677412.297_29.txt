22. OnJune 14, 2013, in preparation for having a TFESI and an Ly injection to her
lower back region, the Respondent had Patient 1 disrobe completely and dress in a hospital
gown. (Test. Patient 1, T. at 203; State’s Ex. 8 at 17-18.) .

23. Before he administered the two injections to Patient 1 on June 14, 2013, the
Respondent examined her in a cubicle near the operating room at the ASC. The cubicle was
open, with patient privacy protected only by two moveable blue curtains that hung from a ceiling
track. That track allowed the curtains to be rolled into place in such a way that they met each
other and surrounded the cubicle. (Test. Patient 1 at 203.)

24, Only Patient 1 and the Respondent were present in the cubicle at _ |
ASC on June 14, 2013, when the Respondent examined Patient 1. (Test. Patient 1, T. at 204.)

25. On the afternoon of June 14, 2013, the Respondent closed the cubicle’s curtains
and examined Patient 1 by having her stand while he sat on a stool. The Respondent was facing
Patient 1’s back. He moved his hands from the bottom of Patient 1’s legs upward to her thighs.
He then moved up to Patient 1’s buttocks region, where placed his hands to the front of Patient
1’s body toward her vagina, coming close to the vaginal opening.” (State’s Ex. 8 at 18.)

26. | When the Respondent approached Patient 1’s vagina with his hands, Patient 1
exclaimed, “Man, what are you doing?” The Respondent reacted to Patient 1’s exclamation by

saying, “It’s all right. Don’t worry. It’s all right.”* (State’s Ex. 8 at 18.)

 

5 The ASC Surgery Consent Form that Patient 1 signed on June 14, 2013 identifies the procedure as a “lumbar
epidural steroid injection facet joint injection (left),” in other words, an LFJ injection, (State’s Ex. 4] at 176.) TFESI
is mentioned on Patient 1’s Anesthetic Record for June 14, 2013. (State’s Ex. 41 at 178.)

7 When she testified, Patient 1 melded her recollection of the June 2013 and January 2014 incidents. Although I find
what she related as a whole credible, I consider what she said to Board Investigator Noppinger on July 8, 2015 more
accurate than when she testified on November 14, 2016, because her Board interview occurred closer in time to
when the incidents happened. (See T. at 205.)

* Patient 1’s recollection of what the Respondent said varied slightly between what she testified to and what she told
Ms. Noppinger on July 8, 2015, At the hearing, Patient 1 stated that when the Respondent's hands came close to her
vagina, she exclaimed, “What are you doing,” and quoted the Respondent's reply as, “Don’t worry. It will be all
right.” On July 8, 2015, Patient 1 told Ms. Noppinger that she exclaimed, “Man, what are you doing?” and quoted
the Respondent’s reply as, “It’s all right. Don’t worry. It’s all right.” The two versions are very similar, but ] am
accepting the July 8, 2015 version, again, because it was closer in time to the date of the incident.
