Re: Eyako K. Wurapa, M.D.
Case No.; 2222-0051
License No.: D76100

Deat Dr, Wurapa and Counsel:

On January 27, 2022, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2). On February
9, 2022, Dr. Wurapa was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing before
Disciplinary Panel A to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. Dr. Wurapa
attended the hearing on that date and was represented by counsel, Carolyn Jacobs, Esquire. The
State was represented by Karen Malinowski, Assistant Attorney General, Administrative
Prosecutor, Both parties presented oral arguments at the post-deprivation hearing.

 

After consideration of the parties’ presentations, Disciplinary Panel A determined, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the health, safety, and welfare of the public imperatively
required the disciplinary panel to summarily suspend Dr. Wurapa’s license and there exists a
substantial risk of serious harm to the public health, safety, and welfare in Dr. Wurapa’s
continued practice. Disciplinary Panel A thus will not lift the summary suspension order, and the
summary suspension imposed on January 27, 2022 is reaffirmed and continues in effect. See
COMAR 10.32.02.08H(1).
