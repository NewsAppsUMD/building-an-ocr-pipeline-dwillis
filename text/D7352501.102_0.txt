FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
PROCEDURAL HISTORY

Ravi Murali, M.D. was originally licensed to practice medicine in the State of Maryland
on January 10, 2012, under license number D73525,! On March 10, 2021, in the United States
District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, Dr. Murali pled guilty to one count of
Healthcare Fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1347. On November 22, 2021, Dr. Murali was
sentenced to 54 months in prison to commence on his reporting date of January 10, 2022,
followed by three years of supervised probation and restitution in the amount of $291,480.00.

On October 14, 2021, the Office of the Attorney General filed with the Maryland Board
of Physicians (the “Board”) a petition to suspend Dr. Murali’s license to practice medicine (“the
Petition”) and a proposed show cause order pursuant to section 14-404(b)(1) of the Maryland
Medical Practice Act. The statute provides:

(i) On the filing of certified docket entries with the Board by the
Office of the Attormey General, a disciplinary panel shall order the
suspension of a license if the licensee is convicted of or pleads guilty or
nolo contendere with respect to a crime involving moral turpitude,
whether or not any appeal or other proceeding is pending to have the
conviction or plea set aside.

' Dr. Murali’s license expired on September 30, 2021. However, pursuant to section 14-403 of the Health
Occupations Article, the license of an individual regulated by the Board may not “lapse by operation of law while
the individual is under investigation or while charges are pending.” The investigation in this case began before the
expiration of Dr. Murali’s license. Therefore, by operation of law, Dr. Murali’s license did not expire during these
proceedings.
