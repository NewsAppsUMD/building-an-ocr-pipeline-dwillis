FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
INTRODUCTION

On July 8, 2015, Harold Alexander, M.D., an obstetrician and gynecologist, was
charged under the Maryland Medical Practice Act (“Act”) with unprofessional conduct in the
practice of medicine and failure to meet appropriate standards for the delivery of quality medical
care. See MD. CODE ANN., HEALTH occ. (“Health Oce.”) § 14-404(a)(3)(ii), (22) (2014). The
charges concerned Dr. Alexander’s care and treatment of a woman who was between 28 and 29
weeks pregnant (“Patient A”).

On September 24, 2015, the case was forwarded to the Office of Administrative Hearings
(“OAH”) for an evidentiary hearing and a proposed decision. A three-day hearing was held
before an Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) at OAH. At the hearing, the State presented
testimony from Ishrat Rafi, M.D. (“Dr. Rafi”) and Matrice Browne, M.D. (“Dr. M. Browne”),
who both were qualified as experts in obstetrics and gynecology. Dr. Alexander testified on his
own behalf and presented testimony from Charlie Browne, M.D. (“Dr. C. Browne”), who was
qualified as an expert in obstetrics and gynecology.

On April 29, 2016, the ALJ issued a proposed decision concluding that Dr. Alexander
