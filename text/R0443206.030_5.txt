Til. SUBSEQUENT BOARD INVESTIGATION

7. The Board conducted an investigation of the Respondent’s conduct at
Facility A and other health care facilities that had employed him as a radiographer. The
Board’s investigation concluded that the Respondent engaged in acts of unprofessional
conduct at health care facilities that included, but were not limited to, sexual
harassment/sexual propositioning of patients; sexual harassment and/or assault of a female
co-worker; inappropriate computer use; aberrant workplace behaviors; and poor or
incompetent provision of radiography services. The Board’s investigation determined that
Facilities A and C terminated the Respondent’s employment for behavioral and/or
performance issues, and a third health care facility, Facility B, allowed him to resign in lieu
of terminating him for similar issues. In addition, the Respondent failed to disclose in his
2017 renewal application that he was under investigation by Facility B for disciplinary
reasons and resigned while under investigation for disciplinary issues.
Facility A

8. The Board’s investigation determined that during the course of the
Respondent’s employment at Facility A, a series of female patients alleged that the
Respondent sexually harassed and/or propositioned them; and that a female co-worker
alleged that he sexually assaulted her in the workplace. These complaints culminated in
Facility A’s firing him on May 2, 2019. The Respondent also used his Facility A computer

to access sexually-oriented websites where he engaged in on-line chats of a sexual nature.
