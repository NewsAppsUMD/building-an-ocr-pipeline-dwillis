Member C., a female (DOD: October 15, 2008); Member D, a female (DOD: July 16,

31. The cause of death as stated on each patient’s death certificate is a medical condition from

=

which the patient had suffered, such as Parkinson’s disease or coronary artery disease.

32. The Respondent knew that each patient’s death was caused by the inhalation of helium and
he knew that none of the patients’ death certificates would state that helium inhalation was
the cause of the patients’ death. (State Ex. 17).

33. The American Medical Association (AMA) issued Opinion 2.211 — Physician-Assisted
Suicide, which provides as follows:

Physician-assisted suicide occurs when a physician facilitates a patients’s death by
providing the necessary means and/or information to enable patient to perform the
life-ending act (e.g. the physician provides sleeping pills and information about the
lethal dose, while aware that the patient may commit suicide).

It is understandable, though tragic, that some patients in extreme duress — such as
those suffering from a terminal, painful, debilitating illness — may come to decide
that death is preferable to life. However, allowing physicians to participate in
assisted suicide would cause more harm than good. Physician-assisted suicide is
fundamentally incompatible with the physician’s role as a healer, would be difficult
or impossible to control, and would pose serious societal risks.

(State Ex. 25).
