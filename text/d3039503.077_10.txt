The Respondent’s long-term prescribing of a CDS to a family member (Patient D)
constitutes unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-
404(a)(3)(ii).

The Respondent’s failure to keep adequate medical records for Patient D constitutes a
violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(40).

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Panel A adopts the ALJ’s proposed default order issued pursuant to COMAR
28.02.01.23A. Panel A thus finds the Respondent in default based upon the Respondent’s failure
to appear at the Office of Administrative Hearings for the Prehearing Conference scheduled for
December 6, 2016. See State Gov’t § 10-210(4). Based upon the findings of fact, Panel A
concludes that the Respondent is guilty of unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in
violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii); failed to meet the appropriate standards, as
determined by appropriate peer review, for the delivery of quality medical care performed in this
State, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(22); and failed to keep adequate medical records as
determined by appropriate peer review, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(40).

Sanction

Panel A adopts the sanction recommended by the ALJ, which is to revoke the
Respondent’s medical license.
