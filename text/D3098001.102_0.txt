FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

 

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

Howard J..Hoffberg, M.D. was originally licensed to practice medicine in the State of
Maryland on June 25, 1984, under license number D30980. On May 20, 2021, in the United
States District Court for the District of Maryland, Dr. Hoffberg pled guilty to one count of
Conspiracy to Violate Anti-Kickback statutes, in violation of 18 U.S.C, § 371. As of the date of
this Order, Dr. Hoffberg has not been sentenced.

On August 25, 2021, the Office of the Attorney General filed with the Maryland Board of
Physicians (the “Board”) a petition to suspend Dr. Hoffberg’s license to practice medicine (“the
Petition”) and a proposed show cause order pursuant to section 14-404(b)(I) of the Maryland

Medical Practice Act. The statute provides:

() On the filing of certified docket entries with the Board by the
Office of the Attorney General, a disciplinary panel shall order the
suspension of a license if the licensee is convicted of or pleads guilty or
nolo contendere with respect to a crime involving moral turpitude,
whether or not any appeal or other proceeding is pending to have the
conviction or plea set aside.

Md. Code Ann., Health Occupations Article (“Health Occ.”) § 14-404(b) (2014 Repl. Vol. &

2020 Supp.). Attached to the Petition were copies of the plea agreement and stipulation of facts.
