primary care physician.

a second complaint (“Complaint B”) from another of the Respondent’s former patients
(“Complainant B”).

8. Complainant B presented to the Respondent on May 6, 2019 with a
complaint of pain and swelling in the left leg. The Respondent subsequently diagnosed
Complainant B with a vascular condition and performed a venogram.' Complainant B
later sought a second opinion from which he learned that the venogram was medically
unnecessary,

9. Complainant B’s diagnosis was not medically justified and the treatment
that the Respondent provided was medically unnecessary based on the incorrect
diagnosis.
