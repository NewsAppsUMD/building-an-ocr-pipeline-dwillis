which he has worked and conducted an under-oath interview with the
Respondent.

9. The Board’s investigation determined that for a period of several years, the
Respondent engaged in a pattern of unprofessional conduct that included, but
was not limited to, sexual harassment of hospital staff, both verbal and physical,
sexual propositioning, and unconsented-to physical contact of at least one
patient. The Respondent’s conduct proceeded largely unchecked over a period
of time due in-part to staff members’ perceptions that any complaints about his
conduct would not be acted upon at the organizational level.

10. The investigation of the Respondent’s conduct is set forth in pertinent part

below.

 

Complainant 1

11.On or about January 20, 2021, Board staff conducted an interview with
Complainant 1, a surgical nurse who worked at the Hospital from 2004 through
2018. In the under-oath interview, Complainant 1 stated:

a. For a while her working relationship with the Respondent was
unremarkable. Eventually the Respondent began to make comments
about her underwear saying, “sometimes you just lean down, your scrubs
are loose and say whoa, | see your pink underwear, your black underwear
or whatever it is...it was never really any more than that until the one
day.”

b. She described an incident during a procedure where they were using a
piece of equipment that “has all these silver balls on it.” She stated that at
the end of the case the balls fell on the floor, so she picked one of them
up and put it in the Respondent’s pocket. The Respondent then asks
Complainant | “why don’t you put them in your mouth?” Complainant 1
