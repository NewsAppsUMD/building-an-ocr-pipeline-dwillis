170. Before she filed a complaint with the Board, Patient 6 had an overall favorable
opinion of the Respondent, so much so that she invited him to her daughter’s wedding in April
2014. (Test. Patient 6, T. at 497-98, 527; State’s Ex. 33 at 00035 »)

171. Patient 6 filed a complaint against the Respondent with the Board on April 25,
2016. (State’s Ex. 26.)

Findings with Respect to Patient 7

172. Patient 7 is a forty-year-old woman. She suffers from lower back pain. As of May -
2013, she had been seeing the Respondent for pain management treatments for approximately
two years. She usually visited him once every three months.” (State’s Ex. 17 at 3, 5.) _

173. On May 28, 2013, Patient 7, accompanied by her five-year-old daughter, went to
a cility”® to get a hard copy of a prescription refill from the Respondent. She had her

vital signs taken at that location, but was told that the Respondent had an emergency and was not

 
 

there; he was edical Office Building. (State’s Ex. 17 at 4.)

174. edical Office Building to get the hard

copy of the prescription refill from the Respondent. (State’s Ex. 17 at 4)

 

The State issued a subpoena for Patient 7 to testify at the hearing, but she failed to appear. According to Ms.
McSherry, Patient 7 was incarcerated at the Charles County Detention Center on November 16, 2016, the date she
was scheduled to appear. (T. at 746.) Although no one verified Patient 7’s incarceration, the State's counsel, Ms.
Pepper, did acknowledge that Patient 7 had been incarcerated previously. (T. at 746-47.) Consequently, I am relying
on the information that Patient 7 provided during her Board interview with Ms. Noppinger on May 4, 2016 as the

primary source for my findings of fact regarding the Respondent’s interactions with Patient 7.

When Patient 7 provided her statement to Ms. Noppinger, she identified the location where she originally arrived
to see the Respondent edical Office Buildi e Respondent strongly disputes the truth of this
testimony.. When he test Respondent noted that lity had not expanded as a “hub” to

provide enhanced medical services, such as = care Or A July 8, 2013. Moreover, the Respondent ~

   
   
    
    
    
   
   
    
 
 

maintains that he did not see any patients in ‘acility until it was a bub, (Test. Respondent, T. at 1024.)
The Respondent also offered a press release to buttress his testj (Resp. Ex. 22.) That press release clearly
establishes the opening o s Medical Office Building ; ahub on July 8, 2013. The Respondent
contends, therefore, that P' *s assertion that she went to in nm May 28, 2013 demonstrates that
she was not telling the truth, because he would not have seen patients there two months later. Because Patient 7
continued to seek treatment from the Respondent after the facility opened, however, she could have been
confused about where she visited him on the date in questi sequently, I do not find her identification of the
place where she went to see the Respondent “ae significant that it completely discredits her. Moreover,
Patient 7’s medical records, and e-mails contai those records, verify May 28, 2013 as a date when the

Respondent examined Patient 7 as well as Patient 7’s concerns about the way the Respondent examined her on that
date, (State’s Ex. 49 at 00007-00011.)
