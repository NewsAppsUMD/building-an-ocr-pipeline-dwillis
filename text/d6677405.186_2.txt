two patients (“Patient 1” and “Patient 2”) during his examination or treatment of
them.

On or about April 9, 2015, Panel B received a complaint from the Medical Group
regarding the Respondent. The Medical Group had received a report in March
2015 from a primary care physician that one of his patients (“Patient 3”) had
complained to him that the Respondent had touched her inappropriately during
an examination in December 2013. The Medical Group reported to the Board
that three separate patients had lodged complaints over the previous year and a
half that the Respondent had touched each patient inappropriately while he
treated or examined her.

Panel B thereafter initiated an investigation that included subpoenaing the
patients’ records and conducting under-oath interviews of the patients, relevant
Medical Group physicians and the Respondent. The results of the Panel’s
investigation are summarized below.

Patient 1

Patient 1, a female in her 50s, had been treated by the Respondent
approximately six times from November 2012 to January 2014.

During Patient ‘1’s course of treatment, the Respondent administered
transforaminal epidural steroid injections (“TFESI”) to her sacroiliac and lumbar
facet joints. The Respondent administered Patient 1’s TFESIs at two of the

Medical Group’s offices in Maryland.
