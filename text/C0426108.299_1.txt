 

investigation of the conviction and his prior applications for license reinstatement and renewal.
In May 2018, based on the Board’s investigation, Disciplinary Panel A of the Board charged Mr.
Gbadamosi with fraudulently or deceptively obtaining or attempting to obtain a license,
unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, and willfully making a false representation
when seeking or making application for licensure or any other application related to the practice
of medicine, in violation of the Act, Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 15-314(a)(1), (3)Gi), and
(36), respectively.

Mr. Gbadamosi requested and received an evidentiary hearing on December 10, 2018, at
the Office of Administrative Hearings before an Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”). In a
Proposed Decision issued on February 22, 2019, the ALJ recommended that the charges be
upheld and found that Mr. Gbadamosi had made false representations when filling out his 2014
Reinstatement Application, his 2017 Renewal Application and a Maryland Hospital
Credentialing Application in 2015. As a sanction, the ALJ recommended that Mr. Gbadamosi’s
physician assistant license be suspended for one year and that he be fined $25,000.00.

Mr. Gbadamosi filed written exceptions to the ALJ’s Proposed Decision, and the State
filed a Response to Mr. Gbadamosi’s exceptions. Both parties appeared before Disciplinary
Panel B of the Board for an oral exceptions hearing on April 24, 2019.2 After considering the
entire record in this case, including the evidentiary record made before the ALJ, and the written

exceptions and oral arguments by both parties, Panel B now issues this Final Decision and Order.
