20. The peer reviewers concurred that the Respondent failed to meet appropriate

standards for the delivery of quality medical and surgical care for all 10 patients. The peer

reviewers cited the following reasons, among others, for their conclusion that the

Respondent did not meet the standards for the delivery of quality medical care:

a.

The Respondent prescribed high dose controlled dangerous substance
(“CDS”) medications to patients, including multiple CDS medications
to single patients, and changed their CDS medications, without
indication and/or without sufficient clinical or diagnostic findings
(Patients 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10);

The Respondent continued to prescribe CDS medications to patients
for Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (“ADHD”) without using
appropriate, reliable tools to diagnose, evaluate, and/or monitor
symptoms (Patients 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10);

The Respondent did not require that patients sign a controlled
dangerous substance treatment agreement despite continuing to
prescribe CDS to these patients (Patients 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and
10);

The Respondent failed to implement consistent medication
compliance monitoring practices (Patients 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10);

The Respondent continued to prescribe and refill CDS medications in
the presence of noncompliant behavior (e.g., patient requesting early
refills; patient prescribed same the CDS medication from another
physician at the same time; patient admitting to illicit drug use) with
no investigation or termination of treatment (Patients 2, 3, 5, 7 and 8);

The Respondent prescribed multiple CDS medications to patients at
one time to “see which works best” without providing sufficient
instruction on how to determine and/or compare effectiveness and/or
discern side effects (Patients 4, 6 and 9);

The Respondent failed to treat or provide referrals for treatment of
other conditions that could be causing or contributing to patients’
symptoms (Patients 4, 7, 9 and 10);
