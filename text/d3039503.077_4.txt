days of the date of the proposed order. The proposed order states that any exceptions must be
sent to the Board with attention to the Board’s Executive Director.

The case came before Board Disciplinary Panel A (“Panel A”) for final disposition.
Neither party filed exceptions.

FINDINGS OF FACT

Because Panel A concludes that the Respondent has defaulted, the following findings of
fact are adopted from the Allegations of Fact set forth in the August 16, 2016, Charges Under the
Maryland Medical Practice Act and are deemed proven by the preponderance of the evidence:

The Respondent was initially licensed to practice medicine in Maryland in 1981. He has
practiced as a general practitioner and is not board-certified or board eligible in any specialty.

On February 26, 1992, the Maryland Board of Physician Quality Assurance (“BPQA”Y
summarily suspended the Respondent’s license based on a June 1991 surrender of his license to
practice medicine in Virginia. The surrender of his Virginia medical license was based on
findings that he had inappropriately prescribed controlled dangerous substances (“CDS”) and
that he had been criminally charged with two counts of unlawful CDS prescribing in Maryland
(those criminal charges were nol prossed).

On June 2, 1992, the Respondent entered into a Consent Order with BPQA under which
the Respondent received a three-year stayed suspension of his license and was immediately
placed on probation for three years with terms and conditions. The probationary conditions
included that he take and successfully pass the Special Purpose Examination (“SPEX”), submit
to a psychiatric evaluation and treatment recommendations, be subject to peer review, submit to

random urinalysis, and that his CDS prescriptions be monitored.

? BPQA was the predecessor to the Maryland Board of Physicians.
