Re: Surrender of License to Practice Respiratory Care
Melissa Rutherford, RCP
License Number: L07049
Case Number: 7722-0002

Dear Dr. Olszyk and Members of Disciplinary Panel A:

Please be advised that, pursuant to Md. Code Ann,, Health Oce. (“Health Occ.”)
§14-5A-16 (2021 Repl. Vol.), | have decided to SURRENDER my license to practice
respiratory care in the State of Maryland, License Number L07049, effective
immediately. I understand that upon surrender of my license, I may not practice
respiratory care, with or without compensation, in the State of Maryland as it is defined
in the Maryland Respiratory Care Practitioners Act (the “Act”), Health Occ. §§ 14-5A-01

position as an unlicensed individual in the State of Maryland.

I understand that this Letter of Surrender is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT, and upon
Disciplinary Panel A’s (“Panel A”) acceptance, becomes a FINAL ORDER of Panel A
of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”).

(7)(Addiction to or habitual use of any narcotic or controlled dangerous substance as
defined in § 5-101 of the Criminal Law Article), and (8)(ii)(Provides professional
services while using any narcotic or controlled dangerous substance as define in § 5-101
of the Criminal Law Article or any other drug that is in excess of therapeutic amounts or
without valid indication). I resolved these disciplinary charges through a Consent Order
with Panel A, dated July 9, 2021, in which Panel A found that I violated Health Occ. §
14-5A-17(a)(3), (7), and (8)(ii). The Consent Order terminated the summary suspension,
suspended my license for a minimum of one (1) year, reprimanded me, and required that I
