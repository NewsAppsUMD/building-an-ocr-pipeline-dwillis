FINDINGS OF FACT

Panel B finds:
I. BACKGROUND
1. The Respondent is a Physician Assistant. The Respondent was initially licensed
by the Board on September 17, 1981. The Respondent's license is scheduled to expire
on June 30, 2019.
2. At all times relevant to these charges, the Respondent was a physician assistant
at an urgent care center located in Havre De Grace, Maryland (“Facility A’).
3. At all times relevant to these charges, the Respondent’s assigned supervising
physician was Physician A. The Board approved the Respondent’s delegation agreement
with Physician A in 2014 for internal medicine duties and urgent care including conducting
histories and physical examinations, interpreting and evaluating patient data,
administering and interpreting EKGs, repairing lacerations and incision and drainage of
superficial abscesses. Pain management and psychiatry were not included in the
requested scope of practice.
4, On or about November 28, 2016, the Board received an anonymous complaint
alleging that a former patient of the Respondent (identified below as “Patient 4”)
presented to Hospital A during the evening of October 2, 2016 purportedly with an
overdose of “Lexapro.” Hospital A conducted a CRISP' search and discovered that
Patient 4 had been prescribed several controlled dangerous substances (“CDS”) by the

Respondent through an urgent care center (“Facility A”).

1"CRISP” stands for Chesapeake Regional Information System for our Patients and is a prescription drug
monitoring program (“PDMP”) available to providers in Maryland and the District of Columbia.
