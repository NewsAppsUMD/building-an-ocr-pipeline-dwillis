Dr. Rajaratnam failed to comply with MPRP’s requirements. He rescinded his
consent to treatment through MPRP. Dr. Rajaratnam failed to schedule an appointment
or meet with Dr. A for a psychiatric evaluation, thereby failing to comply with MPRP’s

that he violated the Consent Order.

Disciplinary Panel A concludes that Dr. Rajaratnam violated condition “1” of the
October 10, 2017 Consent Order.

SANCTION

In determining the appropriate sanction for violating the Consent Order, Panel A
considers the underlying conduct and the nature of the violation. Prior to entering into
the Consent Order, Dr. Rajaratnam was examined by a_ psychologist, who
recommended that Dr. Rajaratnam discontinue the practice of medicine. Panel A did
not revoke Dr. Rajaratnam’s license at that time, but rather entered into a Consent
Order with Dr. Rajaratnam to give him an opportunity to obtain treatment and if he was
deemed safe to practice, to lift the suspension. Instead of taking advantage of the
opportunity presented by the Consent Order, Dr. Rajaratnam violated the Consent
Order’s conditions mere weeks after he entered into the agreement. The appropriate
sanction for Dr. Rajaratnam’s failure to comply with the terms of his Consent Order by
not cooperating with the recommendations of MPRP is the revocation of his medical
license.
