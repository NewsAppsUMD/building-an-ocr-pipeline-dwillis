Dr. Egbert admitted by stipulation that none of the six patients whom he helped commit
suicide had terminal diseases. Dr. Egbert’s conduct towards non-terminal patients was not a
mere administrative oversight. In FEN’s first responder and exit guide training, FEN explained
its approach to non-terminal patients as a feature of the FEN organization, explaining that FEN
“was created specifically to take nonterminal as well as terminal cases.” In a question and
answer pamphlet, FEN claims to be “the only organization in the United States that will support
individuals who are not ‘terminally ill’” and explains “[n]o other organization in the US has the
courage to make this commitment.” Dr. Egbert’s flagrant disregard for the common safeguards
enacted by states that allow assisted suicides supports the conclusion that Dr. Egbert’s actions
are “conduct .. . unbecoming a member in good standing of a profession.” Finucan, 380 Md. at

II. DR. EGBERT’S ADDITIONAL EXCEPTIONS
A. Fraudulently Obtaining Medical Records

The ALJ’s proposed decision concluded that Dr. Egbert improperly held himself out as a
pain management physician in order to obtain patient medical records even though he had no
intention of treating the patients’ conditions. Dr. Egbert excepted to this conclusion. The Panel
accepts Dr. Egbert’s exception because no evidence in the record demonstrates that Dr. Egbert
requested medical records from any physician, deceived any physician in order to obtain medical
records, or that any medical records were directly transmitted to Dr. Egbert from another
physician. The Panel, therefore, does not include these acts, for which there was no evidence, in

the Board’s determination of unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine.
