FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
PROCEDURAL HISTORY

Ravi Murali, M.D., was originally licensed to practice medicine in the State of
Maryland on January 10, 2012, under license number D73525. On March 10, 2021, in the
United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, Dr. Murali pled guilty to
one count of Healthcare Fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1347. On November 22, 2021, Dr.
Murali was sentenced to 54 months in prison to commence on his reporting date of January 10,
2022, followed by three years of supervised probation and restitution in the amount of
$291,480.00.

On October 14, 2021, the Office of the Attorney General filed with the Maryland Board
of Physicians (the “Board”) a petition to suspend Dr. Murali’s license to practice medicine and a
proposed show cause order pursuant to section 14-404(b)(1) of the Maryland Medical Practice
Act. The Board did not receive a response from Dr. Murali. On January 10, 2022, Panel A
issued an Order suspending the license of Dr. Murali pursuant to Health Occ. § 14-404(b)(1).!

On July 22, 2022, the Office of the Attorney General filed with the Board a petition to
revoke Dr. Murali’s license to practice medicine and a proposed show cause order pursuant to

section 14-404(b)(2) of the Maryland Medical Practice Act. The statute provides:

' At the time the Petition was filed in this case, Dr. Murali had not yet been sentenced. Accordingly, a Petition to
suspend Dr. Murali’s license was filed pursuant to Health Occ. § 14-404(b)(1) instead of a petition to revoke
pursuant to Health Occ. § 14-404(b)(2), which is now warranted after the completion of sentencing.
