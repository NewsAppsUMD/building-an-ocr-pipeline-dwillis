The OAH Rules of Procedure provide, in pertinent part, as follows:

.23 Failure to Attend or Participate in a Hearing, Conference, or Other
Proceeding; Default.

A. If, after receiving proper notice, a party fails to attend or participate in a
prehearing conference, hearing, or other stage of a proceeding, the judge _
may proceed in that party’s absence or may, in accordance with the hearing
authority delegated by the agency, issue a final or proposed default order against
the defaulting party. ‘ ‘

C. Proposed Default Orders. A proposed default order is reviewable in
accordance with the delegating agency’s regulations governing review of —

proposed decisions,

COMAR 28.02.01.23A, C.

I find that the OAH provided proper, actual notice of the hearing to the Respondent on
several occasions and the Respondent failed to appear for the hearing, Accordingly, I
PROPOSE:

1, The State’s motion for default be GRANTED. |

2, The Respondent be found in DEFAULT.

3. The Board adopt as fact the statements set out in the Allegations of Fact section of the
State’s Charges;

4, The Board conclude as a matter of law that the Respondent violated sections
15-314(a)(1); 15-314(a)(3); and 15-314(a)(36) of the Maryland Physician Assistants Act in the
mariner set forth in the State’s Charges; and

5. The Board revoke the Respondent’s license to practice as a physician assistant.
