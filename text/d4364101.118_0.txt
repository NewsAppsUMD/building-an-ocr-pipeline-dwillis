Case No.: 2016-0737A
License No.: D43641

Dear Dr. Vaughn and Ms. Rubin:

On December 28, 2017, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl.
Vol.). On January 10, 2018, Disciplinary Panel A held an initial post-deprivation hearing, giving
Dr. Vaughn an opportunity to argue why the summary suspension should not continue. The Panel
waited until 1:40 p.m., 10 minutes after the scheduled hearing was to begin, and Dr. Vaughn did
not appear before Disciplinary Panel A to contest the Order for Summary Suspension of License to
Practice Medicine. The State was represented by Dawn Rubin, Assistant Attorney General,
Administrative Prosecutor.

Disciplinary Panel A of the Board, having considered the investigative information in this
case, continues to believe that the public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires the
summary suspension of Dr. Vaughn’s license within the meaning of Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t §
10-226(c)(2)(i). (2014 Repl. Vol.).
