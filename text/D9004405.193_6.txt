conspiracy.” Alston v, State, 414 Md. 92, 114-15 (2010). Accordingly, through Dr. Yerokun’s
conspiracy, he possessed the specific intent to knowingly defraud the U.S. Government, which
constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude per se. Based on the analysis of the elements of the
crime to which he pled guilty, Dr. Yerokun’s level of culpability is irrelevant.

In addition to the elements of the crime, the facts in support of the guilty plea also

the relevant consideration is whether the crime “was accompanied by a fraudulent or dishonest

genetic testing. Dr. Yerokun also admitted to accepting money in exchange for each order for
DME or genetic testing that he signed even though he was not able to accurately certify that the
services were medically necessary. In doing so, Dr. Yerokun submitted fraudulent health care
claims to the government for purposes of his own personal gain. Walman, 280 Md. at 459-60.
Therefore, the facts of this case also establish that Dr. Yerokun pled guilty to a crime involving
moral turpitude.

Request for a Hearing.

Dr. Yerokun argues that “[a]t a minimum, he should be afforded a hearing before any

turpitude.” As discussed above, the Panel finds that Dr. Yerokun did plead guilty to a crime

involving moral turpitude based on the elements of the crime and the facts in support of the
