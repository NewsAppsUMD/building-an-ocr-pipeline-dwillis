together. At one point, Dr. Schnitzlein asked the patient to delete the text messages they had sent
each other.
Psychologist and Patient Interviews

At a sworn interview on July 12, 2019, the psychologist stated that she began treating the
patient following her discharge from the hospital and observed the patient was “quite distressed”
on June 7, 2019. The patient revealed that she had been involved in an intimate relationship with
Dr. Schnitzlein, expressed guilt for not resisting the relationship and questioned whether she
should blame herself. According to the psychologist, the patient was “incredibly vulnerable.” At
the patient’s interview on August 19, 2019, she told Board staff that Dr. Schnitzlein was her
treating psychiatrist at the hospital, and he offered to exchange personal cell phone numbers just
before her discharge so that she could update him on her status. They exchanged text messages for
a few weeks before he invited her to his hotel “‘to enjoy the amenities.” She described meeting Dr.
Schnitzlein at the hotel [at his invitation], swimming in the hotel pool, going to his room, and
engaging in various sexual activities over several weeks.
Voicemails from Dr. Schnitzlein to the patient

The Board obtained recordings of a series of voicemails left by Dr. Schnitzlein for the
patient on August 26, 2019, which revealed that he called the patient six times between 1] 1:29 a.m.
and 11:46 a.m. Among other things, Dr. Schnitzlein told the patient that he deeply cared and missed
her, that he was “responsible,” that he felt this was “a novel, life-changing experience,” and wished
for “a creative solution,” versus having one “forced upon us through legal or insurance” avenues.
He also stated to the patient that “if you go this route, | won’t be able to see or talk to you again.

And I can’t deal with that...”
