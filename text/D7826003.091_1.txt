BACKGROUND

1. At all times relevant hereto, the Respondent was licensed to practice medicine in
the State of Maryland. The Respondent was initially licensed to practice medicine in
Maryland on July 24, 2014. His license is active and is scheduled to expire on September
30, 2021.

2. The Respondent is board-certified in anesthesiology and critical care medicine.
From 2014 until January 2021, the Respondent was employed by a health care facility
staffing company and primarily practiced as an intensivist at a health care facility located
in Montgomery County, Maryland (“Facility A”).

3. Prior to being licensed in the State of Maryland, the Respondent held a license in
the District of Columbia (D.C.), where the Respondent was employed at a healthcare
facility in the D.C. (the “D.C. Facility”).

4. In approximately May 2009, the Respondent was terminated from the D.C. Facility
after an investigation by the D.C. Facility that determined that the Respondent had misused
and diverted controlled dangerous substances (CDS) at the D.C. Facility. A report of the
investigation was later obtained by the District of Columbia Board of Medicine (“D.C.
Board”).

5. On or about August 18, 2009, the Respondent voluntarily surrendered his license to
practice medicine in D.C.

6. On or about November 16, 2009, (the “D.C. Board”) suspended the Respondent’s

license for at least two years based on the findings of the report of the D.C. Facility.
