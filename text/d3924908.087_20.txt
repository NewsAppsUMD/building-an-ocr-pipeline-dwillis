interpreted because the patches stayed the patient’s back for 72 hours instead of 48 hours. The
Respondent billed for $250. (State’s Ex. 52.)
THE STATE’S EXPERTS
Dr. Jani and Dr. Drelich testified for the State, and each was accepted as an expert in
allergy and immunology. The Respondent did not present any expert testimony. The Panel
adopts the following description of the professional background and credentials of the State’s
experts:

Dr. Jani received her medical degree from Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine in 1998. She was a resident at Barnes-Jewish
Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri, from 1998 to 2001. She was a Fellow in
allergy and immunology at the Washington University School of
Medicine from 2001 to 2003. Dr. Jani was certified by the American
Board of Allergy and Immunology in 2003, and recertified in 2012. She
was certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine in 2001. She
has been in private practice in Frederick, Maryland, since February 2005.
She has also been employed by the Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine, Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Assistant
Professor of Clinical Medicine, [from] January 2005 to July 2006, and
April 2010 to the present. Dr. Jani has been licensed to practice
medicine in Maryland since 2004.

Dr. Drelich received his medical degree from Rutgers Medical

School, Piscataway, New Jersey, in 1981. He was a pediatric resident at

the Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, from 1981 to 1984. He

was a fellow in Allergy and Clinical Immunology at the Henry Ford

Hospital, Detroit, Michigan, from 1991 to 1993. Dr. Drelich has been

certified by the American Board of Allergy and Immunology in 1993,

2003, and 2013. He is board-certified in pediatrics. He has been

licensed to practice medicine in Maryland since 1994.

The ALJ found the testimony of both experts reliable. The ALJ explained that both of
the State’s experts testified in an “understandable and straightforward manner.” The ALJ found
significant that, while there was “‘some variation in their opinions,” they were “consistent in their

opinion that patterns in the Respondent’s practice demonstrate the violations alleged in the

charges,” noting that there was no evidence the experts ever met and discussed standards.
