guilty of immoral and unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine and engaged in sexual
misconduct. The Panel revoked the Respondent's license to practice medicine in Maryland.

On February 12, 2019, the Respondent filed a petition for judicial review with the Circuit
Court for Howard County. Due to an inaccurate transcription of an answer given by the
Respondent at the evidentiary hearing at OAH, the circuit court referred the case back to Panel A,
while the circuit court retained jurisdiction, for Panel A to consider the re-transcription of the
Respondent's answer at issuc and to consider the entire decision in light of the re-transcribed
answer. Panel A has done so and has issued this Amended Final Decision and Order. Panel A has
also added into the evidentiary record the re-transcription of the answer at issue (New
Transcription page 295: 16-18) and the certified audio recording of the evidentiary hearing at
OAH. The newly-transcribed answer at issue replaced for consideration by Panel A the original
transcription of the Respondentâ€™s answer at issue (Original Transcription page 282: 13-14). Panel
A did not consider the original transcription of the answer at issue after the circuit court referred
this matter back to Panel A.
