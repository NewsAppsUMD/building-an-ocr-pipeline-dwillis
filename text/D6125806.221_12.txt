that it was unprofessional, see Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii), for Dr. Singhal to send a message
to Patient 1 and Patient 1’s wife that they should be happy to hear that the physician’s career was

Dr. Singhal’s response is that he was not blaming Patient 1 for his career problems but
was defusing a violent situation, as Patient 1 had threatened violence against Dr. Singhal. Dr.
Singhal claims that by telling Patient 1 that Dr. Singhal was going to suffer, it would calm
Patient 1 and convince Patient 1 that he had destroyed Dr. Singhal’s life and would stop Patient |
from resorting to actual violence. Dr. Singhal suggests that because there was no testimony that
contradicted Dr. Singhal’s interpretation regarding the meaning of the text message, and no
additional evidence that the text message was intended to intimidate Patient 1 or Patient 1’s wife,
that the Panel is required to accept his explanation of the meaning of this text message. Dr.
Singhal also argues that the State’s expert’s interpretation of the text message was a conclusion
of fact and that it was not her role as an expert to testify regarding the intention of the text
message.
The Panel finds that Dr. Singhal’s claim that he sent the message to defuse a volatile situation
does not ring true. His message does not apologize for his conduct or express contrition or
remorse. The message is bitter and accusatory. It simply is not plausible that Dr. Singhal was
