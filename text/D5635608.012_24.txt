S.E.2d 390, 392 (1973) (“when ‘there is nothing other than an unexplained delay on the part of
reporting officials, unaccompanied by any showing of prejudice to the driver, the driver is not
entitled to any relief because of a delay in imposing the suspension. ...’”) The ALJ’s analysis
does not comport with the vast discretion expressly afforded agencies investigating potential
summary suspension cases: “When investigating potential summary suspensions, an agency
should not compromise the thoroughness of its investigation because of the threat of judicial
reversal should the investigation take ‘too long.’” Id.

It is also significant that the Mullan decision cites a New York board case in which the
summary suspension was upheld despite the investigation taking six years. See Mullan, 381 Md.
at 170 (citing John P. v. Axelord, 97 A.D.2d 950, 468 N.Y.S.2d 951-53 (N.Y.App.Div. 1983)).
And the Board has summarily suspended a physician’s license after seven years from when the
Board received the first complaint against the physician and six years after receiving the second
complaint. Roane v. Maryland Board of Physicians, 213 Md. App. 619 (2013). The Panel does
not accept the ALJ’s finding or inference that the order for summary suspension was an abuse of
discretion simply because the investigation took 10 months. The ALJ’s proposed decision does
not set forth any basis for concluding that the order for summary suspension was an abuse of the
panel’s discretion. See Mullan, 381 Md. at 168-73. The State’s exception is granted.

2. RESPONDENT’S EXCEPTIONS

The Respondent argues that the Board violated the Respondent’s due process rights. The
Respondent claims that the Board staff withheld excuipatory evidence from the disciplinary
panel at the time the panel voted to issue the order for summary suspension. The Respondent

contends that the Board’s staff either did not obtain, or purposely kept away, exculpatory
