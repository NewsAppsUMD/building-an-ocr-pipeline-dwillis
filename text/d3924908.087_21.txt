According to the ALJ, both experts found “excessive SPT, excessive repeat SPT without a
histamine control, PT without indication, billing for visits and procedures not documented in the
record, and inadequate medical records.”

A careful review of the evidentiary record and the testimony of the experts confirms the
ALJ’s description of their testimony. By no means was their testimony identical. At times they
relied upon on or emphasized different details. But, in general, they both found the same
patterns of misconduct. Their opinions were well-reasoned, well-founded, and consistent with
fundamental medical principles. Their clear explanations of the intricacies of the field of
allergies and immunology were decidedly helpful. Dr. Jani and Dr. Drelich were reliable expert
witnesses, and the Panel relied heavily upon their testimony and opinions in forming its findings
and conclusions.

EXCEPTIONS
The ALJ succinctly summarized the Respondent’s conduct:
the State demonstrated that the Respondent routinely administered
excessive SPT not supported by patient history, repeated SPT without
first finding a [positive] histamine response, used PT without indication
in some instances, and billed for consultations and tests not documented
in the record. [ALJ’s Proposed Decision at 22.]

The Respondent filed extensive exceptions, but the exceptions generally do not focus on
the conduct summarized by the ALJ and which is central to this case. The core of the case is the
Respondent’s unprofessional conduct and gross overutilization. The Respondent instead focuses
his exceptions on the issue of the standard of care. Although there is certainly some overlap in
this case between the standard of care and unprofessional conduct and gross overutilization, the
nature of the grounds are quite different. Ultimately, though, the most serious concerns of the

Panel and the crux of this case pertain to unprofessional conduct and gross overutilization.
