patient/practice administrator (“Individual A”) at Organization 2. Based on this
self-report the Board opened an investigation.

» A review of the Respondent’s human resources (“HR”) files and other
documents revealed that an outside firm was hired by Organization 2 in or
around February 2018 to conduct an investigation after Individual A reported
that she was having a sexual relationship with the Respondent. The review also
revealed that in or around September 2016, another outside firm investigation
had been conducted to look into allegations that a research coordinator at
Organization 2, (“Individual B”), had been sexually assaulted by the
Respondent while they were attending a medical conference in Florida.

- Throughout the course of the investigations referenced in 6, multiple staff
members including physician-partners of the Respondent, as well as
subordinate staff members and human resources personnel were interviewed.
Several of the interviewees reported concerns related to the Respondent’s well-
established pattern of inappropriate, and in some cases dangerous behavior.

» During the course of the Board’s investigation, Board staff conducted
interviews with numerous patients, former colleagues and subordinates of the
Respondent, and subpoenaed patient medical records, HR files, and prior
complaints against the Respondent. The Board’s investigation is set forth in

pertinent part below.
