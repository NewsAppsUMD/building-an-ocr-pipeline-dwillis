FINDINGS OF FACT

 

Pursuant to KRS 13B.125(2) and based upon the information available to it, Inquiry Panel

A concludes there is probable cause to make the following Findings of Fact, which support its

Emergency Order of Restriction:

1.

At all relevant times, Vinson M. DiSanto, D.O., was licensed by the Board to practice
osteopathy within the Commonwealth of Kentucky.

The licensee’s osteopathic specialty is family medicine.

In or around 2010, the licensee was issued a license to practice osteopathy in the
Commonwealth of Kentucky contingent upon him entering into an Agreed Order of Fine
based upon his non-disclosure of his dismissal from osteopathic school for academic
reasons,

On or about June 2, 2017, the licensee entered into a Stipulation and Order with the Idaho
State Board of Medicine, pursuant to which he was reprimanded and fined, based upon his
prescribing of testosterone, a controlled substance, to Idaho patients via email and
telephone, without having obtained required registrations through the Idaho Board of
Pharmacy and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to issue prescriptions to

patients located in Idaho.

. An investigation into the licensee’s practices in the Commonwealth of Kentucky via

telemedicine and a KASPER review disclosed four (4) patients having received controlled
substance prescriptions from the licensee in Kentucky.
The licensee produced three (3) patient charts in response to a Board subpoena for the four

(4) patient charts. The licensee denied that he treated the fourth patient (“Patient BA”) or

had a chart on Patient BA.
