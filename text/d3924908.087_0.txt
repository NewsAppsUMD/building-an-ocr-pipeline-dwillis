FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

On May 26, 2016, the Respondent Sampson Sarpong, M.D., an allergist, was charged
under the Maryland Medical Practice Act, Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. §§ 14-101—14-702, for
unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, see Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii); grossly
overutilizing health care services, Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(19); failing to meet the appropriate
standards of quality medical care, see Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(22)'; and failing to keep adequate
medical records, see Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(40). The case was forwarded to the Office of
Administrative Hearings (“OAH”) for an evidentiary hearing.

On October 27, 28, and 31, 2016, an evidentiary hearing was held at OAH before an
Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”). The State presented the testimony of Alpa Laheri Jani,
M.D., and Jeremy Drelich, M.D., who were accepted as expert witnesses in allergy and
immunology; Molly Dicken, a compliance analyst for the Maryland State Board of Physicians
(the “Board”); and Patient 10, a former patient of the Respondent. The Respondent testified on
his own behalf and did not present any other witnesses. On January 23, 2017, the ALJ issued a
proposed decision, finding that the Respondent violated Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii), (19),

(22), and (40), and recommended that his license to practice medicine in Maryland be revoked.
