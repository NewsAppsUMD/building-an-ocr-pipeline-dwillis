On February 20, 2020, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
(“Board”) charged Ronnie Taylor, Radiographer, with unprofessional or immoral conduct in the
practice of radiography; professional, physical, or mental incompetence; and failure to cooperate
with a lawful investigation conducted by the Board or a disciplinary panel. See Md. Code Ann.,
Health Occ. § 14-5B-14(a)(3), (4), and (26) (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2019 Supp.). On June 5, 2020,
the case was referred to the Office of Administrative Hearings (“OAH”) for an evidentiary hearing.

On June 12, 2020, OAH mailed a Notice of Scheduling Conference to Mr. Taylor and the
State, at their respective addresses of record, notifying the parties that a telephone scheduling
conference would be held on Jurie 23, 2020, at 9:30 a.m. The telephone conference scheduling
instructions mailed with the Notice stated that the Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) would call
the parties at 9:30 a.m. to commence the conference and listed the phone numbers on file for Mr.
Taylor and the administrative prosecutor. The Notice and instructions mailed to Mr. Taylor were
not returned as undeliverable. On June 23, 2020, at 9:30 a.m., the ALJ made several attempts to
contact Mr. Taylor, but Mr. Taylor did not answer the phone. The ALJ then contaeted the
administrative prosecutor, who answered the phone call, and appeared on behalf of the State. The
ALJ confirmed that there was no request for postponement or other communication from Mr.

Taylor received at the OAH and then held the scheduling conference in Mr. Taylor’s absence.
