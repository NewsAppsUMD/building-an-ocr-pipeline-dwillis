3. If the Respondent is subject to sanction, what sanction is appropriate?
SUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE
The State pre-marked fifty-one exhibits, which it placed in binders in compliance with
my September 23, 2016 Prehearing Order. I admitted all of those exhibits except State Exhibit
Nos. 6, 23 and 40, which the State did not offer into evidence. The Respondent pre-marked thirty
exhibits and offered two additional exhibits (Nos. 31 and 32) during the hearing. The Respondent
also complied with my September 23, 2016 Prehearing Order by placing his exhibits in binders. I
did not admit Respondent Exhibit Nos. 15, 19, 28, 29, 30 and 32, because I sustained objections
to those exhibits raised by the State? (Ihave attached a complete Exhibit List as an Appendix to
this decision.)
