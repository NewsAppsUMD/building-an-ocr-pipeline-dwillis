Sanction and Civil Penalty

The next question is whether the Respondent should suffer the loss of her physician assistant ,
license and a civil penalty. The State recommends a six-month suspension following the
Respondent's successful reinstatement of her physician assistant license in Maryland.

The Respondent has no disciplinary history. Nevertheless, two factors cause me to |
accept the State’s recommendation, First, the Respondent’s actions are serious. She told the
Board during its investigation she was essentially running the physician practice where she was
assigned by herself for four months in early 2015, although Physician C was available to her by
phone and would come to the office to see patients one day per week and Physician D would
visit the office on different occasions to commend her on her job performance and to see
patients. The Respondent also wrote she worked without knowledge of who her supervising
physician was. It is impossible to know whether she meant supervising physician under a
delegation agreement or under the hospital’s hierarchy. Either explanation is especially
troublesome.

Second, although the Respondent testified she understands it is her responsibility to
ensute a delegation agreement is on file, she made no effort to fulfill that responsibility, The
Respondent argues none of this would have happened had Hospital A filed the delegation
agreement for Physician C to serve as her supervising physician, The Respondent does not seem to
understand that she was also responsible for having a delegation agreement on file for someone to
succeed Physician A.

Third, the Respondent said this is 4 “learning experience” for her. The Respondent does not
‘seem to appreciate the seriousness of her conduct, The Respondent cannot jeopardize patient care
during a learning period.
