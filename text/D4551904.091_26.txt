basic, but that he was obviously taking steps to improve. She said that, based on her experience
in his office, she thought it would be very uncharacteristic of the Respondent to say something of
a sexual nature. /
On cross-examination, Mss BBB acknowledged that the last time she interpreted for the
: Respondent was fourteen years ago. She said that between 1998 and 2006, the Respondent went
on mission trips to Central America and the Caribbean and took classes so that he could get
exposure to different dialects of Spanish, and that he was obviously trying to improve his
Spanish during that time.

Ms. aeestimony was credible. She spoke from her experience and credibly
offered her impressions of the Respondent based on her interactions with him. Ms. Bee could
not provide insight on the Respondent’s current demeanor with patients, or his current Spanish
fluency. One could easily conclude that his Spanish is significantly better than it was fourteen
years ago as he has continued the same steps to improve his Spanish over those fourteen yeats _
including taking college courses, visiting Spanish-speaking countries on mission trips at least
three times a year, conversing regularly with Spanish-speaking patients, and attending a church

| in the Hispanic community. I found Ms Restimony credible to establish that the
Respondent has not acted inappropriately with all of his patients, and to establish that the
Respondent has actively sought to improve his Spanish for the. past twenty-plus years, sohis
Spanish proficiency in 2017 would have been better than “basic.” |
