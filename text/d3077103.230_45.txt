Individual C

On March 9, 2017, the Respondent examined Individual C at nell facility in
Washington, D.C. PF a medical student observed the examination, The Respondent
adamantly testified that he did not do anything inappropriate toward Individual C during or after
the examination.

Individual C complained to the Board that while the Respondent examined her and
auscultated her heart, it seemed as though the Respondent cupped her left breast. She also
complained that the Respondent aggressively unzipped and unbuttoned her pants.and did not
. explain what he was doing during the examination. Individual C is still very angry with the
Respondent, believes he spoke to her condescendingly, and believes he unj ustifiably caused her
to experience great pain when he examined her rectum. The Respondent denies intentionally
causing any pain and does not believe he used the auscultation of Individual C’s heart to touch
her breast inappropriately, My impression of Individual C is that she experienced pain during
her examination, However, I cannot find that the Respondent intentionally caused pein or did
anything that was sexually inappropriate for the following reasons.

Individual C filed a complaint with the Washington, D.C. Board of Health regarding her
examination conducted by the Respondent. The Washington, D.C. Board of Health investigated
and found no wrong doing on Respondent’s part. This finding is but one piece in my analysis of
whether the Respondent violated the law when examining Individual C. What is even more
persuasive is that the only eye witness to the examination other than the Respondent and
Individual C, was a medical student who, less than two months after the examination, wrote a
detailed letter to the Washington, D.C. Board of Health concerning her observations. Ms,

_z did not testify at the hearing on the merits and her letter is hearsay. The Administrative

Procedure Act (APA) and the OAH Rules of Procedure discuss hearsay evidence, The APA
