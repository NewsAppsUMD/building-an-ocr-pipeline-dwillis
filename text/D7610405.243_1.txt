should be sent to Christine A. Farrelly, Executive Director, at the Boardâ€™s address. If such a
hearing is requested, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set the hearing to
begin within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08 I, though that 30-day requirement
may be waived.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel B resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely, _ . es
