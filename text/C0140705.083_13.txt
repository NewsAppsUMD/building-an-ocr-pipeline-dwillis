administration in the Clinic was ordered using the DEA number of the Physician.
Testosterone ordered to be dispensed directly to patients was ordered under the DEA
number of the Respondent.

40. Based on its inspection, OCSA concluded that the “clinic practitioners are
dispensing prescription drugs, including CDS medications, directly to patients without any
of the practitioners possessing a dispensing permit issued by the Maryland Board of
Physicians.” This is in violation of COMAR 10.13.01.04B. The OCSA also concluded the
“clinic provides an injection to patients with a dosage significantly higher than the highest
recommended dosage in a commercially available product containing the same ingredient.
This compounded product was involved with medical emergencies involving priapism for
patients of the clinic.”

Practice Review of the Respondent

41. As part of its investigation, the Board issued subpoenas to the Clinic for 16
patient records in total and supporting materials and ordered a practice review (referred to
infra as “Patients 1 through 16”). The review was performed by a physician assistant
delegated to work in urology. The patients whose cases were reviewed were adult male
patients to whom the Respondent treated at the Clinic, including Complainant No. 1,
Complainant No. 2, and Complainant No. 3. The Respondent provided a summary of care
for the 16 patients. The reviewer concluded that in nine (9) of the cases reviewed, the
Respondent failed to meet appropriate standards for the delivery of quality medical care.
The reviewer also concluded that in eleven (11) of the cases reviewed, the Respondent

failed to keep adequate medical records.
