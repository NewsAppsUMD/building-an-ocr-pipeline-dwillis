License No.: L05223

Dear Mr. O’Neill:

On November 6, 2017, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO RESPIRATORY
CARE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t II, § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl.
Vol.). You were given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing before Disciplinary
Panel A to show cause why that suspension should not be continued on November 15, 2017. You
attended the hearing on that date. The State was represented by Robert Gilbert, Deputy Counsel,
Administrative Prosecutor. Both parties presented oral arguments at the show cause hearing.

After considering these arguments at the hearing and the investigative file, Disciplinary
Panel A determined that it would continue the summary suspension imposed on November 6,
2017. Disciplinary Panel A thus will not lift the summary suspension order. The arguments
submitted, when considered in the light of the investigative findings in the file, persuade
Disciplinary Panel A there exists a substantial risk of serious harm to the public health, safety or
welfare in your continued practice. Disciplinary Panel A, through its counsel, advised you of this
decision orally on the hearing date.
