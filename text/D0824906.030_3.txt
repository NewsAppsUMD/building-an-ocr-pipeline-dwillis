Unprofessional conduct has been defined as “conduct which breaches the rules or ethical
code of a profession.” Salerian vy. Maryland State Board of Physicians 176 Md. App. 231, 248
(2007) (citing Finucan v Maryland Bd. of Physician Quality Assur., 380 Md. 577, 593 (2004)).

whether the conduct at issue was unprofessional. Salerian, 176 Md. App. at 249; Finucan, 380

concluded that a romantic relationship concurrent with a physician-patient relationship was
unprofessional based on an opinion by the AMA’s Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs.

Finucan, 380 Md. at 594. The Salerian Court relied on the testimony of the State’s expert who
