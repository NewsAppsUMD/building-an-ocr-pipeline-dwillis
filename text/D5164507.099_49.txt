treatment with the Respondent as a result of the fight. Furthermore, I do not conclude that the
fight constituted unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine as it relates to Patient 1.
Sanctions

The Board seeks to impose the disciplinary sanction of revocation. Md. Code Ann.,
Health Occ. § 14-404(a) (Supp. 2018); COMAR 10.32:02.09A(2), (3)(a)Gv); COMAR
10.32,.02.10, The Board also seeks to require that, should the Respondent apply for the
reinstatement of a license, he appear before the Board for it to determine any preconditions he
must satisfy to resume -the practice of psychiatry. See COMAR 10.32.02.06B; COMAR
10.32.02.09A(5).

I do not adopt the Board’s sought-after sanction of revocation, While I have found that
the Respondent engaged in‘unprofessional conduct iri the practice of medicine, I have not found
that the competent and probative evidence in the record before me fully satisfies the Board’s
burden of proof on all the issues presented.

Ihave determined that the Respondent had engaged in unprofessional conduct in the
practice of medicine because he failed adequately to maintain proper boundaries in his treatment
of Patient 1 and because he impermissibly disclosed and discussed Patient 1’s mental health
condition and treatment to others and made improper statements about SEE enc other
unidentified patients in front of others. These are serious violations and deserving of a
sufficiently severe sanction to protect the public; however, the maximum sanetion of revocation,
is too harsh. ] recommend a mandatory six-month suspension of the Respondent’s license to
practice medicine and a.requirement that before the suspension may be withdrawn, the

Respondent satisfactorily complete a continuing education class or other comparable education
