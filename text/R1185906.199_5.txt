July 18, 2018, the date of his Board interview. Board staff advised Mr. Townes that his
interview date would not change unless an extension was approved by the Board’s Executive
Director. When Board staff requested documentation of his trip, Mr. Townes replied that he had
not had a chance to buy his airline ticket but was going to do so that day. Mr. Townes failed to
