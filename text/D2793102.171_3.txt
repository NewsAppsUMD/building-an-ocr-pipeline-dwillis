be grounds for discipline in Maryland. Dr. Hill argues that the ALJ erred in granting the motion
in limine, which prevented him from admitting evidence to challenge the factual findings and
legal conclusions from the Virginia Board decision.
Analysis
In reciprocal discipline cases, Maryland Courts accept the factual findings and
adjudications of the misconduct in the other jurisdiction as conclusive evidence and do not
permit the relitigation of the facts in the underlying jurisdiction. Attorney Grievance Comm. of
Maryland v. Burghardt, 442 Md. 151, 157 (2015) (in reciprocal discipline cases the factual
findings of the originating jurisdiction are treated as conclusive evidence of misconduct);
Attorney Grievance Comm. of Maryland v. Scroggs, 387 Md. 238, 249 (2005) (“a respondent is
not allowed, other than provided by our rules, to collaterally attack either the findings of fact or
the judgment rendered by the original jurisdiction”); Attorney Grievance Comm’n of Maryland v.
Richardson, 350 Md. 354 (1998) (in reciprocal disciplinary proceedings, attorney cannot attack
or revisit the findings of fact made in the Florida court in the Florida disciplinary proceeding);
Attorney Grievance Comm. of Maryland v. Sabghir, 350 Md. 67, 68 (1998) (respondent may not
“collaterally attack findings of fact made by the New York court or the judgment it rendered.”).
Other states also preclude challenging “reciprocal discipline” before a professional
licensing board. Shoenhair v. Com. Dept. of State Bureau of Professional and Occupational
Affairs, 459 A.2d 877, 879 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 1983) (Petitioner cannot collaterally attack the
waiver of rights to a Florida hearing); Weiss v. New Mexico Bd. of Dentistry, 110 N.M. 574, 585
(1990) (Dr. Weiss “may not collaterally attack his conviction in a disciplinary proceeding before
an administrative board which is totally without jurisdiction to determine the validity of the

conviction, or to overturn or vacate it.”); In re Zdravkovich, 831 A.2d 965, 968-69 (D.C. 2003)
