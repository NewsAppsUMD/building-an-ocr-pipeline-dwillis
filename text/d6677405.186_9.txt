Patient 2 did not return to the Respondent after her August 18, 2014
appointment. Patient 2 was so upset by the Respondent's conduct that she did
not open a follow-up e-mail® from him for almost two weeks.

In September and October, 2014, Patient 2 sent e-mails to the Respondent
inquiring about the results of her tests. The Respondent responded to her first e-
mail, but failed to respond to subsequent correspondence.

On October 15, 2014, Patient 2 e-mailed her primary care physician (“Physician
3”). In the e-mail, Patient 2 reported that she “felt [she] had been sexually
abused by one of [Physician 3’s] colleagues.”

Patient 3

Patient 3, a female in her 40s, initially presented to the Respondent on or about
December 16, 2013 to have her intrathecal pump* refilled with pain medication.
The Respondent examined Patient 3 during the December 16, 2013 visit. A
female chaperone was not present during the examination.

Patient 3 complained of pain in her hip. The Respondent instructed Patient 3 to
stand up and pull her pants down. Patient 3 pulled her pants down far enough to
reveal her back. The Respondent, who was seated in a stool behind Patient 3,
began touching her mid and lower back and asked Patient 3 if she felt pain as he
touched various areas.

Patient 3 stated that she felt pain when he touched her hip. The Respondent

replied that that area was her pelvis.

5 The e-mail, dated August 18, 2014, consisted of a standard message that it was a pleasure to have
seen Patient 2 and providing contact numbers for non-urgent matters.
