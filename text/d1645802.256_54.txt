would often provide refills that were issued well in advance of when the initial prescriptions
expired.

The Respondent did, however, cooperate fully with the Board’s investigation. He did not
retain counsel for this hearing due to financial constraints, but nevertheless presented his defense
in a sincere and forthright manner. He is very respectful of the process.

I firmly believe that the Respondent does not find any fault with his pain medicine
practice and in particular, his prescribing methods. In view of the testimony of Dr. Wright and
the peer reports, it is a concern that if the Respondent were to return to his pain medicine
practice, he would continue to utilize the same methods he previously used that caused the Board
to charge him with violations of the Maryland Medical Practice Act.

Sanctions .

Pursuant to COMAR 10.32.02.09B, there are both aggravating and mitigating factors that
may be considered in imposing a sanction against the Respondent. The State acknowledged that
the Respondent was cooperative with the Board’s investigation, and also, that he has never
before been disciplined by the Board. COMAR 10.32.02.09B(5)(a). He did not, however,
voluntarily admit any misconduct. COMAR 10.32.02.09B(5)(c). Since he did not claim any
misconduct, he did not self-report to the Board any incident.

There was potential harm to patients as at least one of his patients expired due toa
combination of drugs that were prescribed by the Respondent, although other providers provided
additional quantities of the same drugs. COMAR 10,32.02.09B(5)(h). His actions were
intentional as all of the prescriptions for his patients were issued by him and since he did not
acknowledge any wrongdoing, his practice of issuing opioid prescriptions would likely continue

if he were permitted to return to his pain medicine practice. COMAR 10.32.02.09B(5(g) and(i).
