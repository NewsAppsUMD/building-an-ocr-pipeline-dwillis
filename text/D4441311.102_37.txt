The Board considered some of the mitigating and aggravating factors set forth in
COMAR 10.32.02.09. As mitigating factors, the State noted that the Board has never before
disciplined the Respondent. COMAR 10.32.02,09B(5)(a). Additionally, the Respondent self |
reported his relationship with Individual A to the Board. COMAR 10.32.02.09B(5)(b).
However, the State suggested that this mitigating factor was quelled by the fact that the
‘ paspanident aaly sbititepietial after Individual A filed a lawsuit and an EEOC complaint against
him for sexual harassment; he did so eae he ‘knew the Board would sci aware of the
relationship. Nevertheless, the Respondent was cooperative in the Boaid’s investigation, which I
alse find to bs a mitigating factor. -

. The Board also found that there were aggravating factors, The State argued that the
Respondent’s actions were deliberate, a with gross negligence or reckless, by having sexual -
relations with a patient, knowing the medical we prohibition against doing so.

combination of factually discrete offenses adjudicated in a single action. COMAR

that a physician can be prosecuted for only one sexual encounter with a patient. His violations’
