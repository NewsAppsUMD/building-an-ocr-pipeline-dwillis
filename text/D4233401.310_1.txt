1991, and he continuously renewed his license, He last renewed his license in September 2018,
which had the expiration date of September 30, 2020.

expired in 2015, He also holds inactive medical licenses in New Jersey (granted 1970),
Massachusetts (granted 1990), and Connecticut (granted 1992).

anesthesiology, surgery, preventative medicine, occupational medicine, and psychiatry. At
present, his self-designated specialty is pain management. He is not, and has never been, board-
certified in any practice areas. He does not hold any hospital privileges.

days per week. Most of his patients were chronic pain patients. Since approximately the past
