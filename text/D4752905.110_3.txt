12, The peer review was performed by two peer reviewers who are board-

certified in addiction medicine (“Peer Reviewer 1” and “Peer Reviewer 2,” respectively).

On or about October 25, 2019, the peer reviewers submitted their reports to the Board.

13. The peer reviewers independently concluded that the Respondent failed to

meet appropriate standards for the delivery of quality medical care in nine (9) of the ten

(10) patients whose records were reviewed.

14. The peer reviewers identified five major areas of concern with respect to the

Respondent’s prescribing practices:

i.

iii.

The Respondent prescribed various combinations of controlled
dangerous substances (“CDS”), such as benzodiazepines, opioids and
sedative-hypnotics, to patients, and failed to provide appropriate
informed consent or document or disclose the risk for concomitant use
of these medications. See e.g., Patient 2 (tramadol and Suboxone);
Patient 3 (tramadol and Suboxone); Patient 5 (tramadol and
Suboxone); Patient 8 (Ambien and Xanax); and Patient 10 Percocet
and Xanax).

The Respondent did not perform comprehensive assessments to
include detailed histories, thorough physical examinations or make
timely referrals when necessary. See e.g., Patients 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10.

The Respondent regularly prescribed CDS, such as benzodiazepines
and opioids, to patients with a history of substance abuse, with little
justification or documentation supporting their need or efficacy,
particularly when non-abusable alternatives were available. See e.g.,
Patients 2, 3, 5 and 9.

The Respondent practiced substandard and dangerous addiction
medicine when he:

a. Ordered urine drug screens but ignored or failed to
address results indicating that patients took dangerous
combinations of abusable drugs and/or had not
complied with prescribed medication directions. See
e.g., Patients 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10.
