other location in this State in violation of section 14-404(a)(22) (2014) of the Health Occupations
Article. As a result, I conclude that the Board may discipline the Respondent for the cited
violations, COMAR 10.32.02.09A and B.

PROPOSED DISPOSITION

 

I PROPOSE that the charges filed by the Board against the Respondent on September
12, 2014 be UPHELD; and

I PROPOSE that the Respondent be suspended from the practice of medicine for a
period of one year, and if he wishes to have his license reinstated, he must petition a disciplinary
panel for approval who would also determine the terms of probation which would last for three
years, Additionally, the Respondent will no longer be allowed to prescribe opiate containing
medications to patients and will permanently cease his pain management practice. If the
disciplinary panel lifts his suspension, the panel will also decide what controlled substances or
class of controlled substances the Respondent may prescribe for his patients. Finally, I
recommend that the Board maintain the right to monitor the Respondentâ€™s medication

prescribing practices.
