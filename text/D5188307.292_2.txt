Treatment of Family Member 1

The ALJ found and the Panel upholds a finding that Dr. Mikhail is guilty of
unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)Gi),
for treatment of members of his family. Unprofessional conduct is “conduct which breaches the
rules or ethical code of a profession or conduct which is unbecoming a member in good standing
of a profession.” Finucan v. Board of Physicians, 380 Md. 577, 593 (2004). Additionally,
unprofessional conduct includes acts that are commonly understood by the profession to be
prohibited. See Salerian vy. Maryland State Board of Physicians 176 Md. App. 231, 248 (2007).
In both Salerian and Finucan the courts approved the use of the AMA Guidelines and an opinion
of the AMA’s Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs, respectively, in determining whether the
conduct at issue was unprofessional. Salerian, 176 Md. App. at 249; Finucan, 380 Md. at 593.
The Board’s regulations provide that “the disciplinary panels may consider the Principles of
Ethics of the American Medical Association.” COMAR 10.32.02.16. The American Medical
Association (“AMA”) Code of Medical Ethics’ Opinion on Physicians Treating Family Members
(Opinion 8.19) and the AMA’s Code of Medical Ethics Opinion 1.2.1 were admitted into
evidence and considered by the State’s expert in reaching her conclusion that Dr. Mikhail’s
conduct was unprofessional.

Ethics Opinion 8.19 states “[p]hysicians generally should not treat . . . members of their
immediate family.” The opinion discusses how “{p]rofessional objectivity may be compromised
when an immediate family member . . . is the patient; the physician’s personal feelings may
unduly influence his or her professional medical judgment, thereby interfering with the care

being delivered.” The ethics opinion states that “[p]hysicians may fail to probe sensitive areas
