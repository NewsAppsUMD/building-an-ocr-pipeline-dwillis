19. By letter dated November 15, 2023, the Board notified the Respondent that
her evaluation would be conducted on November 27, 2023. On the morning of November
27, 2023, prior to the time scheduled for the interview, the Respondent requested that the
evaluation be rescheduled, which the Program denied. The Respondent failed to present
to the Program for the evaluation. The Board then rescheduled the evaluation for
November 29, 2023. The Respondent did not present to the Program for the evaluation on
that date, however.

20. By email dated December 1, 2023, the Board requested that the Respondent
explain in writing why she failed to appear for both of the above appointments. The
Respondent responded in an email dated December 1, 2023, stating, “I do not smoke
cigarettes, drink alcohol, smoke marijuana or any other drug so I do not need rehab for any
reason. Sorry, I missed your letter for an appointment. Please let me reschedule and I
promise to attend.”

21. The Board then scheduled the evaluation for December 6, 2023. On that
date, a team of Program evaluators met with and evaluated the Respondent. The Program
evaluators unanimously concluded that based on the Respondent’s writings, interviews,
behavior during the evaluation, complex medical history and other pertinent information,

the Respondent “is not able to practice medicine safely.”>
