physician on the radiologist’s report. Exhibit A2 at 50,52. Dr. Hardi reviewed and signed the
document on January 23, 2017 and February 8, 2017. Exhibit A2 at 49, 51.

The ALJ found that a practice record from July 21, 2016, was likely altered because it
contains results from a September 28, 2017 medical procedure which was after the date that the
medical record was written and because the signature line was blank and unsigned. ALJ Prop.
Dec. § 32; Exhibit A2 at 167. The ALJ speculated that someone else at the practice could have
altered the record. The ALJ noted that Individual A had access to the records. ALJ Prop. Dec. at
26.

Panel B does not adopt the ALJ’s finding that the July 21, 2016 record was altered. In
the panel’s view, there is likely a more innocent explanation for reference to the unchronological
September 28, 2017, procedure result. Panel B finds that by a preponderance of the evidence,
the Electronic Medical Record program automatically filled information in the July 21, 2016,
record either when it was accessed after October 2017, or when it was printed in response to the
Board’s subpoena. Seven records from July 2015 through October 2017 with three different
providers all include identical entries under the titles Past Medical History, Social History, and
Family History.‘ Each of the first six entries that were created before the September 28, 2017,
medical procedure occurred mention the medical procedure from that date. Each medical record
was on a different date and had different listings under “Diagnoses” and “Plan.” But each record
was unsigned and contained the identical entries for the Past Medical History, Social History,
and Family History. Based on the experience of panel members, the panel finds that it is most
* Specifically, the identical records include July 9, 2015 visit with Dr. Hardi, July 18, 2016 visit with
Physician Assistant 1, July 21, 2016 visit with Dr. Hardi, January 17, 2017 visit where the provider was
Physician Assistant 2 and the referring physician was Dr. Hardi, September 6, 2017 visit where the

provider was Physician Assistant 2 and the referring physician was Dr. Hardi, and September 8, 2017
visit with Physician Assistant 2, and an October 12, 2017 visit with Dr. Hardi.
