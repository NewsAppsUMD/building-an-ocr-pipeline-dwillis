Sanctioning Recommendation

Having found the State proved the Respondent engaged in unprofessional conduct in
the practice of medicine, I now tum to the question of what sanction, if any, is appropriate. The
State recommended a revocation of the Respondent’s license.

The guiding regulations in this matter, found at COMAR 10,32.02.09B, provide in
pertinent part as follows:

should be made and that the sanction in a particular case should fall outside the
range of sanctions listed in the sanctioning guidelines. ‘
