impaired the Respondent’s due process rights. The Respondent claims that Board staff purposely
withheld exculpatory material, specifically the “Demand Letter” (Resp.’s Ex. 7), from the panel
that issued the order for summary suspension. But the investigative material contained the fact
that Complainant 2 asked for $5,000,000 in exchange for her not pursuing actions against the
Respondent. (State’s Ex. 19 at 3, T. 9; State’s Ex. 26 at 7.) And the Respondent entered the
Demand Letter into evidence at the hearing before the ALJ (R. 174), and counsel for the
Respondent cross examined Complainant 2 about the Demand Letter. (T. 292-303.) The Panel
does not find any intent to keep exculpatory information away from the panel that issued the
summary suspension.

Furthermore, the concern that the Respondent has expressed over the information before
the disciplinary panel at, or prior, to the. issuance of the order for summary suspension, is
addressed by the post-deprivation hearing that is promptly held before a disciplinary panel after
the order for summary suspension is issued. Under COMAR 10.32.02.08B(7)(c), “[t]he
respondent is provided with a postdeprivation opportunity to be heard within 15 days by the
disciplinary panel, that voted to summarily suspend the license.” If the panel affirms the
summary suspension after the postdeprivation hearing, the Respondent has the right to a full
evidentiary hearing before an ALJ. The order for summary suspension was issued on July 2,
2021, and the postdeprivation hearing was held on July 15, 2021. At the postdeprivatrion
hearing, the Respondent had the opportunity to present his concerns about the summary
suspension, including presenting to the panel any relevant information he felt the panel should
have been apprised of.

Moreover, the significance of the Demand Letter in this case is not as consequential as

the Respondent argues. The Panel is aware that Complainant 2 has a financial stake in her
