broader meaning than the doctrine requires.” Haile, at 469 (quoting Boyle v. Maryland-National
Capital Park & Planning Comm’n, 385 Md. 142, 156 (2005)).

The Panel finds that the ALJ’s application of the doctrine of ejusdem generis was
improper. None of the conditions required to apply the doctrine of ejusdem generis are present
here. The statute does not have an enumeration of specific words and there is no applicable
class. The sole inclusion of “ending of a human pregnancy” by itself cannot be sufficient to
demonstrate that it is the first of a class of permitted actions. Even if there is an implicit class
consisting of controversial practices, there is no indication that this one item, ending pregnancy,
can, by itself, be considered an exhaustive list. Finally, there is no general reference
supplementing the enumeration. In sum, the doctrine of ejusdem generis is not applicable to
interpreting the definition of the practice of medicine.

Dr. Egbert’s actions throughout the suicide process were “in the practice of medicine,”
under § 14-404(a)(3)(ii).

II. UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT

A. ALJ’s Proposed Decision and Exceptions

The ALJ found that, because she had determined that participation during the actual
assisted suicide did not constitute the practice of medicine, whether Dr. Egbert’s actions were
unprofessional or not was of no consequence. The ALJ found that, in Dr. Egbert’s review of the
medical records, Dr. Egbert’s conduct was egregiously unprofessional.

The State took exception to the ALJ’s analysis. Dr. Egbert excepted to the conclusion

that his review of the medical records was inherently unprofessional.
