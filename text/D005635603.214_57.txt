 

 

at the time, Individual 12, noticed and asked Complainant 2 if everything was okay. Individual 12
suggested some light exercises for Complainant 2 to perform.

24. The Respondent asked what Complainant 2 and Individual 12 were discussing,
When Complainant 2 said she had back pain, the Respondent offered to check her out between
surgical cases. Later, he escorted Complainant 2 into an empty office between the OR and the
post-anesthesia care unit and offered his help.

25. Complainant 2 went willingly into the empty office. Thé Respondent closed the
door. There was no one else in the room other than the Respondent and Complainant 2.

26. | The Respondent asked Complainant 2 to point out the location of the pain. She
turned around and pointed to her lower back area, above the buttocks and below the spine. She
was wearing scrubs. The Respondent asked her to lift up her scrub shirt so he could get a better
visual and put his hands around her waist and felt her back with his thumbs to ascertain the location
of her pain.

27. The Respondent asked Complainant 2 to lower her pants so he could get a better
visual. She did so willingly, untying and holding the draw strings to her pants so they would not
fall to the floor. The Respondent felt her back and commented on her underwear, that they were
cute, and on how good she looked from his point of view. Complainant 2’s mid-buttocks and skin
were exposed. He pushed on her lower back and below her underwear line. He made a sound,
“like a groan. In a sense, like, mm-hh.”

28. Complainant 2 felt extremely uncomfortable and quickly pulled up her pants and
left the room. She went to the OR front desk and told the charge nurse that she was uncomfortable
and did not want to return to the Respondent’s OR that day. The charge nurse assigned

Complainant 2 to a different room for that day.
