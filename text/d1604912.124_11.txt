5. Dr. Egbert had Notice that his Review of Medical Records would be
Considered In the Practice of Medicine.

Dr. Egbert argues in his exceptions that he was not given notice that his review of

exhausted by the enumeration; (4) a general reference supplementing the enumeration, usually

following it; and (5) there is not clearly manifested an intent that the general term be given a
