When treating self or family members, physicians have a further
responsibility to:

(c) Document treatment or care provided and convey relevant
information to the patient’s primary care physician.

(d) Recognize that if tensions develop in the professional
relationship with a family member, perhaps as a result of a
negative medical outcome, such difficulties may be carried
over into the family member’s personal relationship with the
physician.

(e) Avoiding providing sensitive or intimate care especially for a
minor patient who is uncomfortable being treated by a family
member.

(f) Recognize that family members may be reluctant to state their
preference for another physician or decline a recommendation
for fear of offending the physician.
