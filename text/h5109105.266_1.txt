with all of MPRP’s evaluation and treatment recommendations, and the MPRP’s determination
that he was fit to resume clinical practice. In addition, the Consent Order provided that upon
termination of the suspension by Disciplinary Panel B, Dr. Rassael be placed on probation for a
minimum of three years subject to terms and conditions deemed appropriate by the MPRP and
the panel.

On April 4, 2016, the MPRP provided a written update to the panel on Dr. Rassael’s
ongoing participation in and adherence to his MPRP Agreement and Plan. The MPRP deferred to
the panel’s judgment on whether Dr. Rassael’s license should be reinstated. The MPRP submitted
a list of recommended terms and conditions in the event that the panel determined to terminate
the suspension and reinstate Dr. Rassael’s medical license.

On April 29, 2016, Dr. Rassael filed a written Petition for Termination of Suspension and
appeared before Disciplinary Panel B on May 25, 2016, for consideration of the petition.

Based on Disciplinary Panel B’s review of the documents submitted by the MPRP for the
panel’s consideration, the panel will not terminate Dr. Rassael’s suspension at this time. It is
hereby:

ORDERED that Dr. Rassael’s suspension shall continue until Disciplinary Panel B:

a. Approves a licensed physician to supervise and monitor the implementation of terms and
conditions recommended by the MPRP, as detailed on page 4 of this Order; and

b. Approves Dr. Rassael’s individual practice guidelines, protection and organizational plans
with respect to office changes, and his professional and personal plans for maintaining
appropriate, strict, professional boundaries with patients and staff. Dr. Rassael shall
submit all plans and individual practice guidelines to the MPRP for MPRP approval prior
to submitting them to the panel for panel approval; and it is further

ORDERED that successful compliance with the first condition requires that:
