AMA OPINION 9.4.4, JUNE 2016
AMA Code of Medical Ethics: Professional Self-Regulation Opinion 9.4.4, adopted

in June 2016, pertaining to Physicians with Disruptive Behavior, states in pertinent part:
The importance of respect among all health professionals as a means of
ensuring good patient care is foundational to ethics. Physicians have a
responsibility to address situations in which individual physicians behave

care, including conduct that interferes with the individual’s ability to work
with other members of the health care team, or for others to work with the
physician.
