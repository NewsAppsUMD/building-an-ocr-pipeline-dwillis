15. The second procedure involved a right laparoscopic pyeloplasty the
Respondent was unable to complete. During the procedure, the Respondent was unable to
thread the catheter and was observed to have difficulty seeing. The staff of Health Care
Facility A were concerned about excessive delay of several hours, the inability of the
Respondent to thread the catheter and observed vision and dexterity problems, including a
visible tremor of the right hand.

16. During the second procedure, staff of Health Care Facility A alerted
leadership and supervisory staff of concerns about the Respondent; specifically that he had
a visible tremor and they did not feel comfortable with the Respondent continuing the
procedure. Supervisory staff and leadership of Health Care Facility A physically went to
the location of the second procedure, called a safety timeout and ordered the Respondent
to stop the case. Thereafter, arrangements were made for another urologist to complete the
procedure to assure patient safety.

17. Leadership at Health Care Facility A stated: “To my observation as having
come in later on in the procedure to observe, there was a stent cannulation process that was
required for the ureter and the stent was not going into the ureter as planned, it was curling
up. And rather than attempt another technique, there was an effort made multiple times to,
to do the procedure in the same fashion. And the concern from my standpoint...was the
potential injury to the ureter, and so we had a, another urologist come in and successfully

assist with that.”
