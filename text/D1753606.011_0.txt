FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
INTRODUCTION

On July 15, 2020, Disciplinary Panel A (“Panel A”) of the Maryland State Board of
Physicians (“Board”) issued an Order for Summary Suspension, summarily suspending the license
of Akram Salihi, M.D., pursuant to its authority under Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2)
(2014 Repl. Vol. & 2020 Supp.) and Md. Code Regs. (“COMAR”) 10.32.02.08B(7), concluding

2020, Panel A charged Dr. Salihi under the Maryland Medical Practice Act with being

14-404(a)(4). Dr. Salihi requested an evidentiary hearing to challenge the July 15, 2020 summary
suspension and August 17, 2020 charges. The hearings were consolidated, and, on September 11,
2020, an evidentiary hearing was held before an Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) at the Office
of Administrative Hearings (“OAH”).

Both parties offered testimony from fact witnesses and from expert witnesses who testified
