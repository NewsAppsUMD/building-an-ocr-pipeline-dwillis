 

panel has no discretion to consider mitigation and the only issue to decide is whether Ms. Ashby’s
conviction for Theft-Scheme is a crime involving moral turpitude.

In the licensure context, “[t]he term ‘moral turpitude’ has been defined generally as
importing ‘an act of baseness, vileness or depravity in the private and social duties which a man
owes to his fellow men, or to society in general, contrary to the accepted and customary rule of
right and duty between man and man.’”” Aftorney Grievance Comm'n of Md. v. Walman, 280 Md.
453, 459 (1977) (quoting Braverman v, Bar Ass'n of Balt. City, 209 Md. 328, 344, cert. denied,
352 U.S. 830 (1956)). “[I]t is settled that whatever else [moral turpitude] may mean... a crime
in which an intent to defraud is an essential element is a crime involving moral turpitude, It is also
settled that the related group of offenses involving intentional dishonesty for purposes of personal
gain are crimes involving moral turpitude{.]” /d. at 459-60. When a conviction does not, on its
face, establish moral turpitude, the determination of moral turpitude “hinges on the facts present
in the individual case at hand.” /d. at 462. It is well established that “in the context ofa licensing
board’s review of the conduct of its licensee, the concept of moral turpitude is rather broad.”

Ms. Ashby’s conviction for Theft-Scheme: $10,000 to $100,000 falls into the category of
offenses involving intentional dishonesty for purposes of personal gain. Ms. Ashby used a
company credit card to make purchases for her personal use that were not authorized by anyone at
the company. The conservative amount of estimated purchases totaled $34,433.90. Ms. Ashby’s
actions were deliberate, willful, and with the intent to deceive her employer from whom she
embezzled the funds. Ms. Ashby then tried to conceal her actions and the credit card charges to
avoid being caught. Ms, Ashby’s actions were “intentional, or not innocent in [their] purpose, or

not accidental.” Board of Dental Exam’rs v. Lazzell, 172 Md. 314, 322 (1937).
