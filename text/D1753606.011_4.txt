uncontested and Dr. Salihi admitted that he should have remembered the names. The details of
Dr. Salihi’s Board interview are relevant for explaining the reasons why Dr. Salihi was sent for a
Health Occ. § 14-402 evaluation but are of little consequence when compared to the results of the
evaluation itself.

Panel B has carefully reviewed the ALJ’s proposed findings of fact and finds that each of
the proposed findings of fact, with the small modification discussed above, was established in the
record, and supported by a preponderance of the evidence.

IL Mental Incompetence

As a result of concerns regarding Dr. Salihi’s memory and ability to answer questions
during his interview with Board staff, the Board referred Dr. Salihi to the Maryland Professional
Rehabilitation Program (“MPRP”) for an independent evaluation to assess whether he was
competent to practice medicine. The clinicians at MPRP performed an intake evaluation and
expressed significant concerns regarding Dr. Salihi’s cognitive functioning. The Medical Director
of MPRP opined that Dr. Salihi was unsafe to practice medicine pending the results of a
neurocognitive evaluation and referred Dr. Salihi to a neuropsychologist for purposes of
conducting an independent neurocognitive evaluation to determine whether Dr. Salihi was
competent to practice medicine. On July 14, 2020, Dr. Salihi underwent.an independent evaluation
by a neuropsychologist who conducted an in-person neuropsychological examination of Dr. Salihi
with the assistance of a credentialed psychology associate.? The neuropsychologist concluded,
after reviewing the results of the tests conducted by the psychology associate, that Dr. Salihi was

not competent to practice medicine safely.

3 The results of the tests performed as part of the evaluation are not disclosed in this document to protect Dr. Salihi’s
private health information.
