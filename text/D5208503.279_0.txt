ORDER AFTER SHOW CAUSE HEARING

On July 10, 2018, Alice O. Adams, M.D. entered into a Consent Order with Disciplinary
Panel B (“Panel B”) of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”) wherein she
agreed to enroll in the Maryland Professional Rehabilitation Program (“MPRP”) and comply
with all of the MPRP’s recommendations. Dr. Adams enrolled in MPRP, but subsequently
withdrew from the program, and, therefore, on October 3, 2018, MPRP closed her case for cause
due to her unwillingness to follow MPRP’s recommendations,

FINDINGS OF FACT

Background

On or about September 20, 2017, the Board received a complaint alleging that Dr.
Adams’s office was dirty, and that Dr. Adams appeared to be impaired during an office visit by
exhibiting slurred speech and repetitive questioning. The Board opened an investigation into the
allegations. During the course of the investigation, the Board conducted two site visits and
issued a subpoena to the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (“PDMP”) for a list of
controlled dangerous substances (CDS) prescribed to Dr. Adams. The PDMP and pharmacy
records revealed prescriptions for opioids and benzodiazepines. On January 24, 2018, the Board
ordered Dr, Adams to be evaluated by MPRP. The evaluation concluded that Dr. Adams’s

personal and professional judgment was impaired and that she posed a risk to her patients.
