Order After Show Cause Hearing: November 22, 2019

Panel A issued an Order After Show Cause Hearing on November 22, 2019, reprimanding
Dr. Andrews and placing her on a new period of probation for a minimum period of three years.
During the probationary period, Panel A again required Dr. Andrews to remain enrolled in MPRP,
and to continue in a Participant Rehabilitation Agreement and Participant Rehabilitation Plan. The

Order also provided that:

Dr. Andrews shall fully and timely cooperate and comply with all Program
referrals, rules, and requirements, including, but not limited to, the terms and
conditions of the Participant Rehabilitation Agreement(s) and Participant
Rehabilitation Plan(s) entered with the Program, and shall fully participate and
comply with all therapy, treatment, evaluations, and screenings as directed by the
Program.

In addition, the Order states:

ORDERED that, after the appropriate hearing, if the disciplinary panel determines
that Dr. Andrews has failed to comply with any term or condition imposed by this
Order, the disciplinary panel may reprimand Dr. Andrews, place Dr. Andrews on
probation with appropriate terms and conditions, or suspend or revoke Dr.
Andrewsâ€™s license to practice medicine in Maryland. The disciplinary panel may,
in addition to one or more of the sanctions set forth above, impose a civil monetary
fine upon Dr. Andrews.

On December 16, 2019, Dr. Andrews signed a new Participant Rehabilitation Agreement

with the Program for a duration of three years.
