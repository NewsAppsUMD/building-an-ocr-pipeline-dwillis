Epstein’s prescribing CDS to family members while failing to recognize red flags suggesting
abuse or diversion. The State’s expert was also concerned with the safety of Dr. Epstein’s

prescribing two medications that work at cross-purposes to Family Member 2. Dr. Epstein

prescribed medications and otherwise treated family members outside his area of expertise. The.

Panel finds that his specific treatment of family members was disturbing and raises serious
concerns about his medical judgment.

Dr. Epstein argues that the proposed sanction is “absurd” and “an attack on my character.
I have been an upstanding member of this community and the medical community my entire
life.” But, as the State noted in its response to Dr. Epstein’s exceptions, Dr, Epstein has a
lengthy disciplinary history with the Board. Dr. Epstein has been reprimanded three separate
times, suspended for 30 days, continuously on probation from 2007 through 2018, and was
ordered to pay fines totaling $65,000. His violations have concerned patient care, honesty, and
patient safety and are briefly summarized below.

In a 2007 Consent Order, the Board found that Dr. Epstein performed a surgical
procedure, a panniculectomy, that he was not credentialed to perform, failed to document
informed consent, acceptéd payment from the patient knowing that the procedure was rejected by
the insurer for coverage. He also failed to name the procedure when posting the panniculectomy
in the Operating Room or in the discharge notes, failed to dictate the procedure into the operative
note, and allowed the hospital to bill the insurer for the operative time for the non-covered
procedure. The Board found that Dr. Epstein violated the standard of care, failed to keep
adequate documentation, and engaged in unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in

violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii), (22), and (40).
