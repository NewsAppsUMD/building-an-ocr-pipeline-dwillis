There is no reasonable explanation for the Respondent’s behavior. There was no basis
for him to assume S. W. was involved in or approved of the San Bernardino attacks. There was
no basis for him to believe that because of her religious affiliation, she was in any way ignorant
of the laws of the United States. It was not appropriaté for him to “vet” her; she was not in his
office on a social call. By questioning S.W. about her religious beliefs, lecturing her on the
inappropriateness of committing murder, raising his voice at her multiple times because her
answers were apparently not satisfactory to him, and interfering with her custody and control
over her client, the Respondent behaved unprofessionally towards S.W. on December 5 , 2015.
He was clearly practicing medicine at the time of the incident, as all of the conduct occurred.
within the context of his examination of Patient A.

Incident on February 22, 2016 .

The evidence demonstrates the Respondent engaged in unprofessional conduct towards
S.B. on February 22, 2016. He raised his voice at her, physically advanced on her in an
. intimidating roanner, told her to get out of his office, and locked her client, Patient B, in his
examination room, out of her reach and sight. S.B. felt compelled to call the police once the
Respondent locked Patient B inside an examination Toor. .

The Respondent disputed some of S.B.’s characterization of events and argued that her
" recall of their interactions was exaggerated. Specifically, the Respondent denied pushing a
wheelchair into S.B.’s legs, pushing her in the shoulder, and telling her to “get the fuck out of”
his office. He conceded, however, that he felt S.B. was not helpful with Patient B and, as a

result, he became frustrated with her.
