Respondent’s Written Response

6. According to the Respondent’s written response to the Complaint, the
Respondent has worked for approximately 14 years as a radiographer in Maryland, and
started his employment at the Center in February 2021 as a computerized tomography (CT)
Technician. This role was outside the Respondent’s previous professional experience as an
x-ray (radiograph) technician, and he was trying to “develop new skills” on this “entirely
new modality.”

7, The Respondent blamed his termination on an incident that occurred just
before his separation, when he attempted to perform a CT angiogram on a patient using
intravenous (IV) contrast solution. Regarding this procedure, the Respondent
acknowledged being a “novice” and failed to successfully mark the iliac artery with

contrast, which led to an inconclusive CT scan because of the Respondent’s failure to

terminated any licensee for any reason that might be grounds for disciplinary action under § 14-SB-14 of
this subtitle.”
