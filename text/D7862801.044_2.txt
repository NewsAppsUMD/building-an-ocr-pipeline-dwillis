suspended her clinical privileges after the Respondent attempted to provide medical
services while under the influence of alcohol.
The Complaint

5. The Board initiated an investigation of the Respondent after receiving a
Mandated 10-Day Report (the “Report”) from the Hospital on August 1, 2023. The Report
stated that the Respondent was “summarily suspended...in accordance with hospital’s
medical staff bylaws to reduce the substantial likelihood that Dr. Gucwa’s exercise of her
clinical privileges would create a reasonable possibility of imminent danger to the health
and safety of patients and others at the hospital. The Hospital determined that Dr. Gucwa
was intoxicated at work on June 20.”

Board Investigation

6. The Board subpoenaed and received the Respondent's quality assurance/risk
management (“QA/RM”) file from the Hospital, employee health file from the Hospital,
and treatment records from two health care facilities. The Board also interviewed the Chief
Medical Officer of the Hospital and received a written response from the Respondent.

7. The investigation determined that on June 20, 2023, the Respondent was
intoxicated while at work at the Hospital. On June 20, 2023, at 7:30 a.m., the Respondent
was scheduled to perform an interventional radiology procedure in the ambulatory surgery
center at the Hospital.

8. Staff observed that the Respondent seemed impaired and instructed her not
to perform the procedure. The Respondent was escorted from the surgical suite, and another
vascular surgeon was called and provided services to the patient.
