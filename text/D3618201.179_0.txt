Re: Crystal McGinty, M.D.
Case No.: 2219-0011A
License No.: D36182

Dear Dr. McGinty and Counsel:

On January 3, 2019, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl.
Vol.).

On January 16, 2019, Disciplinary Panel A held a post deprivation hearing to show cause
why that suspension should not be continued. Dr. McGinty did not attend. She was represented
by Bruce Marcus, who appeared at the hearing telephonically. The State was represented by
Robert Gilbert, Assistant Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor. Both parties presented
oral arguments at the hearing.

After considering these arguments at the hearing and the investigative file, Disciplinary
Panel A determined that it would continue the summary suspension imposed on January 3, 2019.
Disciplinary Panel A thus will not lift the summary suspension order. Disciplinary Panel A finds
that the public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires the suspension of Dr. McGinty’s
license. See State Gov’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i). The order of summary suspension is thus reaffirmed
