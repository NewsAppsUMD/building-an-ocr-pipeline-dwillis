(2004); Board of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, 354 Md. 59 (1999); Cornfeld v. State
Bd. of Physicians, 174 Md. App. 456, cert. denied, 400 Md. 647 (2007); and Kim v. Md. State
Bad. of Physicians, 423 Md. 523 (2011).

By contrast, the Maryland Court of Appeals has made it clear that the practice of
medicine does not include acts that are only tangentially-related to the responsibilities and
practice as a physician. McDonnell v. Comm'n on Medical Discipline, 301 Md. 426 (1984).

Particularly, the McDonnell Court held that the actions of a physician, who attempted to
intimidate experts scheduled to testify against him in a medical malpractice case, did not occur in
the practice of medicine. In so holding, the Court explained that although “Dr. McDonnell’s act
was ‘related to his professional practice . . . [it] was insufficient to bring his conduct within the
Statute’s requirement that the conduct occur in his practice as a physician.” Jd. at 437. The Court
further elucidated that the physician’s actions were aimed at prevailing at an adjudicative matter
and had only a “general or associative relationship to the physician in his capacity as a member
of the medical profession.” Essentially the Court opined that the adjudication of McDonnell’s
medical malpractice case was tangential to the work he performed as a physician.

After the McDonnell Court made clear that the physician’s conduct in that case did not
constitute the practice of medicine, in Finucan v. Md. Bad. of Physicians Quality Assur. and
Board of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, 354 Md. 59 (1999), the Maryland Court of
Appeals addressed when a physician’s actions may be considered to have occurred within the
practice of medicine. Particularly, the Court held that a physician violates section 14-404 (a)(3)
when he displays unprofessional conduct within the medical setting, or while he is generally
performing tasks that are integral to the practice of medicine, whether or not the conduct itself is

medical in nature.
