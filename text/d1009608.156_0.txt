Pursuant to the authority granted to the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the

“Board”) under Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 14-206, the Board hereby orders JOHN

SHEEHAN, M.D. (the “Respondent”) to immediately CEASE AND DESIST from the

unauthorized practice of medicine in Maryland.

INVESTIGATIVE FINDINGS

Based on information received by, and made known to and available to the

Board, the Board has reason to believe that the following facts are true:

1.

The Respondent is not currently licensed to practice medicine in the State of
Maryland. He was initially licensed in Maryland on April 6, 1971; however, his
license expired on September 30, 1991.

The Respondent was licensed to practice medicine in Colorado from November
12, 1981 until April 30, 2015, when his license expired.

The Respondent does not have an active license to practice medicine in any
state.

The Respondent’s medical specialty was psychiatry.

On December 29, 2015, the Colorado Medical Board issued to the Respondent a
Cease and Desist Order, having determined that the Respondent had practiced

medicine in Colorado subsequent to the expiration of his license.
