During the course of the surgery, the Respondent had difficulty placing the trocars?
and was unable to place a uterine manipulator after attempting to do so for
approximately one-half hour. Another surgeon (“Physician 2”) intervened and
completed the surgery.

As aresult of the concems regarding the Respondent’s judgment and skill, including
those expressed subsequent to the August 16, 2018 surgery, the Respondent was
placed on a three-month Focused Professional Practice Evaluation during which
time she was required to have a second surgeon present during major gynecological
surgeries she performed.

On October 2, 2018, the surgeon monitoring one of the Respondent’s surgeries
expressed concerns regarding her skill and judgment while performing a
laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy.

As a result of the continued concerns regarding the Respondent, the Hospital
suspended the Respondent’s privileges for one month.

In November 2018, the Respondent was reinstated.

In December 2018, the Respondent retired from the Hospital.

In furtherance of its investigation, the Board subpoenaed from the Hospital the
records of the August 16, 2018 and October 2, 2018 surgeries performed by the
