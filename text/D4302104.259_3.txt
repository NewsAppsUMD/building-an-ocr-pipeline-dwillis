3. The Board initiated an investigation of the Respondent after reviewing a

previously worked as a certified registered nurse anesthetist (“CRNA”) at the Facility. The
Complainant worked at the Facility beginning in or around 2003 until in or around
February 2016. The Complainant alleged that during the course of her contract at the
Facility, the Respondent “regularly made lewd sexual remarks about [her] body,” both in
private and in the presence of female colleagues; sexually harassed her and physically
intimidated her by standing unnecessarily close to her or by otherwise invading her
personal space, which drew the attention of her colleagues; acted in a demeaning manner
toward her and other female staff persons; and had unprofessional relationships with one
or more female staff persons. The Complainant stated that after she approached the

Respondent to address these behaviors, he terminated her employment.

3 To maintain confidentiality, the names of health care facilities, the Complainant and Facility staff persons
have not been identified in this charging document. The Respondent is aware of the Complainant, and all
health care facilities and Facility staff persons referenced herein.
