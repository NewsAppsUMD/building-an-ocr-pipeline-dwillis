7. Facility A’s audit further revealed that the Respondent through Facility A’s
electronic medical records system prescribed Adderall to herself on March 25, 2020, at
6:38 p.m. and March 26, 2020, at 2:33 p.m. and 3:24 p.m. None of the prescriptions,
however, resulted in pharmacy dispensation.

8. Facility A’s records further revealed that the Respondent had written and
mailed three prescriptions for Adderall to an individual (“Individual A”) located in
Tennessee who was not a patient of record of Facility A. Facility A became aware of this
action on or about May 21, 2020, when the envelope was returned to Facility A by the
Postal Service because Individual A had moved without leaving a forwarding address. The
envelope contained three prescriptions for Adderall #120 issued by the Respondent to
Individual A.

9. When asked about the three prescriptions, the Respondent told Facility A
staff that Individual A was a former patient of hers when she worked in Tennessee who
was in need of Adderall for ADD. The Respondent also stated that she did not keep a
medical record of Individual A.

10. In furtherance of its investigation, the Board reviewed drug surveys and
obtained copies of all CDS prescriptions the Respondent had issued. A review of the
prescriptions showed that the Respondent self-prescribed Adderall on the following dates
for the following quantities:

« June 24, 2019, Adderall 10 mg (#150)
