FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On March 19, 2019, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
(“Board”) charged Robert Hardi, M.D., with immoral and unprofessional conduct in the practice
of medicine and engaging in sexual misconduct.! See Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 14-
404(a)(3)(i), (ii), Health Occ. § 1-212; COMAR 10.32.17. The charges alleged that Dr. Hardi
had a sexual relationship with a patient, Individual A, and engaged in misconduct with

Individuals B, C, D, E, and F that was, in general, sexual in nature.

‘In August, 2019, an Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) held a six-day evidentiary
hearing at the Office of Administrative Hearings. “At that hearing, the State introduced 23
exhibits and testimony from'13 witnesses. Dr. Hardi introduced 309 exhibits and testimony from
12 witnesses. On November 12, 2019, the ALJ issued a proposed decision recommending that
the charges pertaining to Individual A be upheld. The ALJ, however, found that the State did not
prove the allegations against Dr. Hardi pertaining to Individuals B, C, D, E, or F. The ALJ
recommended that Dr. Hardi be suspended for one year, retroactive to March 5, 2019, the date

' Qn March 5, 2019, Disciplinary Panel A issued an order summarily suspending Dr. Hardi’s license for
the same conduct. An evidentiary hearing was not held for the summary suspension. The summary
