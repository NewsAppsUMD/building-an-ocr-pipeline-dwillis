RE: Surrender of License to Practice Medicine
License Number: D33090
MBP Case Number: 2016-0490

Dear Ms. Farrelly and Members of Disciplinary Panel B,

Please be advised that I have decided to SURRENDER my license to practice
medicine in the State of Maryland, License Number D33090 effective immediately. I
understand that upon surrender of my license, I may not give medical advice or treatment
to any individual, with or without compensation, and cannot prescribe medications or
otherwise engage in the practice of medicine in the State of Maryland as it is defined in
the Maryland Medical Practice Act (the “Act”), Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. (“Health
Occ.”) §§ 14-101 et seq. (2014 Repl. Vol.) and other applicable laws. In other words, as
of the effective date of this Letter of Surrender, I understand that the surrender of my
license means that I am in the same position as an unlicensed individual in the State of
Maryland.

I understand that this Letter of Surrender is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT and on
Disciplinary Panel B (“Panel B”) of the Maryland State Board of Physicians’ (the
“Board’s”) acceptance, becomes a FINAL ORDER of Disciplinary Panel B.

I acknowledge that the Board opened an investigation concerning my self-
prescribing. I have decided to surrender my license to practice medicine in the State of
Maryland to avoid further investigation and prosecution of the allegations and due to my
current health issues and planned retirement. I recognize that for all purposes relevant to
medical licensure that these allegations shall be treated as proven and that these
allegations support a conclusion that I violated Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii)
(unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine).
