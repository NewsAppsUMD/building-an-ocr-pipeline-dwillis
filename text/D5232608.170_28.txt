The Respondent further testified that he is not aware of any policy or guidelines that
require disclosure of a personal relationship with a patient and emphasized that he was not
romantically involved viel - and she was not living with him — at any of the times he treated
her. In retrospect, he acknowledged that he understands that disclosure would have been wise.
He also noted that the complaint against him did not originate witl but with her mother,
with whom Be been involved in a heated custody dispute over her young son.’ Finally, he
acknowledged that his conduct was not perfect, but maintained that he acted with the best of
intentions, and that his only concern was the safety and well-being of his patient.

Analysis: Unprofessional Conduct and Immoral Conduct

 

Unprofessional Conduct

. Based on the evidence before me, I am persuaded that the Respondent’s actions constitute
unprofessional conduct. Specifically, the Respondent prescribed medications, including
controlled dangerous substances, outside of the emergency department without documenting the
prescriptions in a corresponding medical record. In addition, on seven occasions, he prescribed
controlled dangerous substances within the context of an emotionally and financially complex,

- close personal relationship that is not disclosed anywhere in the medical records.
That the Respondent prescribed medications on the four identified occasions — September

1, 2015; October 28, 2015; January 13, 2016; and February 23, 2017 — without documenting the
prescriptions is uncontested. On each of the four occasions, these prescriptions included
tramadol, a controlled dangerous substance. As BE 0 2patiney explained, without
documentation, critical information, such as the diagnosis and the reason for the chosen
treatment, are not captured, maintained, and available for use, and that without such *

documentation, the patient is prevented from receiving appropriate care.
