not to appear for the interview, the Board may construe that as failure to
cooperate with a lawful Board investigation.

At one point during the telephone call, the Respondent told Board staff that she
had been out of town and did not receive the subpoena “until seven days ago.”
The Respondent requested the interview to be rescheduled.

A few minutes later, Board staff telephoned the Respondent to advise her that
her request to reschedule the interview had been denied. The Respondent
responded that she lives over an hour away and had “things to do today” and
“other commitments.” The Respondent stated that she would appear for the
interview if her boyfriend could be present during the interview. Board staff
denied the Respondent’s request.

The Respondent failed to present herself at the Board on January 27, 2017.

On January 30, 2017, Board staff sent to the Respondent by next-day mail a
letter directing her to appear at the toxicology screening facility for testing on
February 1, 2017 at 1:00 p.m. The letter further informed the Respondent that
pursuant to Health Occ. § 14-402(c), unreasonable refusal or failure to submit to
the screening constitutes prima facie evidence of a licensed medical
practitioner's inability to practice medicine, unless the Board finds that the failure
or refusal was beyond control of the licensee.

On January 30, 2017, Board staff spoke to the Respondent by telephone and
informed her that the Board had sent her correspondence that required her
immediate attention. The Respondent stated that she would look for the letter

and respond.
