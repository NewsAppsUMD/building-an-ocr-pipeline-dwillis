CONSENT ORDER

The Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”) and the Respondent, Martin Liss,
M.D., agree to enter into this Consent Order in order to resolve Dr. Liss’ dispensing prescription
medication without a permit issued by the Board.

FINDINGS OF FACT

On June 20, 2005, the Board issued Dr. Liss a permit to dispense prescription medication
in Maryland. The dispensing permit had an expiration date of June 1, 2015. Dr. Liss did not file
an application with the Board to renew that permit, thus, the authorization for Dr. Liss to
dispense prescription medication expired on June 1, 2015. After the expiration of the dispensing
permit issued on June 20, 2005, Dr. Liss continued to dispense prescription medication in
Maryland, although he did not have a permit to do so. On or about August 26, 2015, the Board
received Dr. Liss’ application for the reinstatement of his dispensing permit.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Based upon the findings of fact, the Board concludes that Dr. Liss failed to comply with §
12-102 of the Health Occupations Article, in violation of § 14-404(a)(28) of the Health
Occupations Article. Section 12-102 of the Health Occupations Article requires that a physician
dispensing prescription medication or devices has a permit issued by the Board. See Health Occ.
