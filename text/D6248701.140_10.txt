30. The Respondent repeatedly said during the interview that he could not
recall details about his treatment or personal contact with the Patient after she was
discharged. When shown copies of specific text messages, including an exchange of
heart emojis and references to baths, the Respondent answered, “Good question; don’t
know.” When asked to discuss any intimate contact with the Patient, the Respondent
answered, “I can’t because it’s wiped from my memory.” He later described his memory
loss about his relationship with the Patient as follows: “I can’t see or feel or remember
the experience, but I’m left with these symptoms that point to an experience and J can’t
say what the experience is.”

31. When asked about exchanging text messages that may have had sexual
innuendos, the Respondent said that “anything’s open game in therapy, you could talk
about anything, that is the safety about therapy, is that’s a safe place to discuss anything.”
He said that he would have sent such messages to the Patient for “her therapy.”

32. The Respondent acknowledged calling the Patient in August 2019 and
leaving voicemails, but he could not recall what he said.
