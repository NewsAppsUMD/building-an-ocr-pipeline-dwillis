Sexual Misconduct Arguments

State’s argument about whether Patient 1 was a current patient

The State argues that the Panel should take into consideration the fact that Dr. Singhal
stated that he was unsure if Patient 1 intended to return to his office for future appointments. Dr.
Singhal responds that Patient 1 was not a current patient and suggests that the State is now
arguing that Patient 1 was a current patient, and he was not given sufficient notice that he was
being charged with having a sexual relationship with a spouse of a current patient, which would
be a violation of the Board’s sexual misconduct regulations. Dr. Singhal notes that there are no
facts to support that Patient 1 was still a patient at the time the sexual relationship began with
Patient 1’s wife.

The Panel agrees with Dr. Singhal that Patient | was not a current patient when the
sexual relationship began. The Panel agrees with the ALJ that the physician-patient relationship
ended in February or March of 2016. The sexual relationship began in June 2016, after the
physician-patient relationship ended. Dr. Singhal was not charged with sexual misconduct, and
there were no allegations of facts in the charging document to support that Patient | was a patient
in June 2016.

Dr, Singhal’s due process argument

Dr. Singhal argues that finding him guilty of unprofessional conduct would violate his
due process. He argues that Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 1-212 required the Board to define
in regulation the boundaries of disallowed sexual relationships. He suggests that because sexual
behavior with a former patient’s spouse is not prohibited in the regulations, then it is, by its

omission, permitted. The Panel rejects this argument.
