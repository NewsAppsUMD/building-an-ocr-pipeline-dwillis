FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

On September 2, 2016, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
(“Board”) charged John S. Dalton, Il, M.D., with unprofessional conduct in the practice of
medicine. See Maryland Code Annotated, Health Occupations § 14-404(a)(3)(ii). The charges
alleged that Dr. Dalton acted unprofessionally in two separate instances.

On March 6, 2017, after a two-day evidentiary hearing before an Administrative Law
Judge (“ALJ”) at the Office of Administrative Hearings, the ALJ issued a proposed decision
concluding that Dr. Dalton was guilty of unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine. The
ALJ recommended suspending Dr. Dalton’s medical license for one year, referring him to the
Maryland Professional Rehabilitation Program (“MPRP”) to assess whether any additional
rehabilitative or remedial measures are necessary to address Dr. Dalton’s conduct, requiring him
to undergo a neurocognitive evaluation, and having him reappear before a Panel of the Board to
determine whether any further steps are necessary.

Dr. Dalton filed exceptions, and the State filed a response. On June 14, 2017,

Disciplinary Panel A of the Board (the “Panel”) held a hearing on Dr. Dalton’s exceptions.
