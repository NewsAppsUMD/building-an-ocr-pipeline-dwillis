3 MME isa value assigned to each opioid to represent its relative potency by using morphine as the standard
comparison. The Centers for Disease Control Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain uses
MME to establish recommended opioid dosing and currently recommends using caution when preseribing
opioid doses greater than 50 MME per day and avoiding or carefully justifying a decision to increase opioid
doses to greater than or equal 90 MME per day.
