CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Pursuant to COMAR 10.32,02,07EQ), a response to a show cause order must be limited
to the following issues: “(a) Lack of conviction or plea; (b) Whether the crime is one involving
moral turpitude; (c) Misidentity of the respondent with the defendant in the criminal matter, and
(d) Other relevant issues, if any, other than mitigation.” The Board’s regulations only permit a
limited evidentiary hearing on the same issues. COMAR 10.32.02.07E(3).

Dr. Babaturk does not dispute that the crimes he pled guilty to are crimes involving moral
turpitude. In response to the petition to revoke his license, Dr, Babaturk wrote a letter to the
Board stating, “This note is confirmation that I would like to defend myself and leave all options
open including Court.” Dr. Babaturk stated that his answer to the Petition would include abuse
of power, defrauding, and attempts at extortion, but the Board never received any further
communications from Dr. Babaturk. Dr. Babaturk did not request an evidentiary hearing, but to
the extent that Dr. Babaturk’s request to defend himself may be interpreted as a request for a
hearing, Panel A declines to grant Dr. Babaturk’s request for a hearing, pursuant to COMAR

10.32.02.07 E(3). As determined by the panel, no genuine issues of material fact or law exist in

this case. Jd.
