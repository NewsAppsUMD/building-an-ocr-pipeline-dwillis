wrong" with the Respondent when he could not recognize staff members with
whom he had worked for over six months. Facility staff immediately began
rescheduling patients and reported the Respondent's state to management who
arrived at the Facility approximately an hour and a half later. Upon arriving,
Facility management staff observed the Respondent attempting to light a
cigarette on the wrong end.

Board staff interviewed the Respondent under oath. The Respondent admitted
that he ingested a dose of Controlled Dangerous Substances around 9:00 p.m.
the evening of May 4, 2020. The Respondent further explained that he
"probably" consumed one or two alcoholic beverages around 10:00 p.m. or
11:00 p.m. The Respondent lastly stated that he ingested another dose of
Controlled Dangerous Substances around 2:00 a.m. the morning of May 5,
2020 before getting up around 6:30 a.m. and arriving to the Facility around
9:00 am. During his testimony relating to the May 5, 2020 incident, the
Respondent stated, "I was impaired when I got [to the Facility] and I took that
very seriously ... I'm glad I did not see any patients that day[.]"
