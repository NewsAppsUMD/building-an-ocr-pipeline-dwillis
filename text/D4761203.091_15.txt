like this had happened to one of his patients. Patient 10 felt that Dr. MacKoul did not take her
complaints seriously. Patient 10 requested another physician consultation because she did not trust
Dr. MacKoul after his “overkill” comment.

It was ultimately determined that a bowel blockage caused Patient 10’s pain. On December
22, 2015, another physician removed a bowel blockage and Patient 10 was discharged on
December 28, 2015.

Dr. MacKoul did not remember stating “this is overkill” but also did not deny making the
comment. Rather, he claimed that he was merely educating the patient that she was suffering from
a hematoma, not an abscess, and that the antibiotics were overtreatment. Dr. MacKoul also
explained that he transferred Patient 10 to Hospital B because he did not have privileges at the
other hospital.

The ALJ found Patient 10’s testimony sincere and credible and without embellishment and
Dr. MacKoul’s testimony heartfelt and sensible. The ALJ concluded that the comments were
inappropriate or inconsiderate from Patient 10’s subjective viewpoint, but that accepting such
comments as unprofessional would create a slippery slope and force the Board to find
unprofessional any comments that a patient finds unprofessional.

The State argues that Dr. MacKoul’s comments to Patient 10 were “disdainful, crass, and
void of any therapeutic purpose whatsoever.” Dr. MacKoul argues that his comments were only
inappropriate or inconsiderate from Patient 10’s subjective viewpoint and that, from the ALJ’s
objective viewpoint, the comments did not rise to the level of unprofessional conduct.

The Panel adopts the ALJ’s findings. Although Dr. MacKoul’s comments to Patient 10
caused distress, the Panel does not find that Dr. MacKoul’s comment “this is overkill” by itself is

unprofessional. Dr. MacKoul should continue to work on his interpersonal skills with patients, as
