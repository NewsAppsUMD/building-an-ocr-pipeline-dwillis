Case No.: 2218-0282A
License No.: D55094

Dear Dr. Burbano and Counsel:

On January 2, 2019, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl.
Vol.).

On January 16, 2019, Disciplinary Panel A held a postdeprivation hearing to show cause
why that suspension should not be continued. You attended the hearing on that date together with
your counsel, Robert A. Wells, Esq. The State was represented by Robert Gilbert, Assistant
Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor. Both parties presented oral arguments at the
hearing.

After considering these arguments at the hearing and the investigative file, Disciplinary
Panel A determined that it would continue the summary suspension imposed on January 2, 2019.
Disciplinary Panel A thus will not lift the summary suspension order. Disciplinary Panel A finds
that the public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires the suspension of Dr. Burbano’s
license. See State Gov’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i). The order of summary suspension is thus reaffirmed
