Re: Surrender of License to Practice Medicine
Robert J. Reilly, M.D.

License Number: D24986

Case Number: 7718-0057

Dear Dr. Bhandari and Members of the Disciplinary Panel A,

Please be advised that, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. (“Health Occ.
IT”) § 14-403 (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2017 Supp.), I have decided to SURRENDER my
license to practice medicine in the State of Maryland, License Number D24986, effective
immediately. I understand that upon surrender of my license, I may not give medical
advice or treatment to any individual, with or without compensation, and cannot prescribe
medications or otherwise engage in the practice of medicine in the State of Maryland as it
is defined in the Maryland Medical Practice Act (the “Act”), Health Occ. II §§ 14-101 et
seq. and other applicable laws. In other words, as of the effective date of this Letter of
Surrender, I understand that the surrender of my license means that I am in the same
position as an unlicensed individual in the State of Maryland.

I understand that this Letter of Surrender is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT, and upon
Disciplinary Panel A’s (“Panel A”) acceptance, becomes a FINAL ORDER of Panel A
of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”).

I acknowledge that the Board initiated an investigation of my practice and on
August 28, 2017, Panel A issued disciplinary charges against me under Health Occ. § 14-
404(a)(22) (violation of the standard of care) and (40) (fails to keep adequate medical
records). I resolved these disciplinary charges through entering into a Consent Order
with Panel A, dated November 28, 2017, (the “Consent Order’), in which Panel A found
that I violated Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(22) and (40). Under the Consent Order, I was
reprimanded, placed on probation for a minimum of one (1) year and required to comply
with certain terms and conditions, including: cease treating patients for chronic pain;
completion of Board disciplinary panel-approved courses in medical recordkeeping and
prescribing of opioid medication; and completion of a chart and/or peer review at the
Board’s discretion. A copy of the Consent Order is attached and incorporated herein as
Attachment 1.
