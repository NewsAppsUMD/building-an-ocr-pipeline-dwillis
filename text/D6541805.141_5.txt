11. For 20 patients, for the period June 21, 2017 through January 31, 2019, the
Respondent repeatedly issued prescriptions for high-dose CDS. The Respondent’s medical records
do not reveal why high-dose CDS were prescribed or why, for several patients, more than one
high-dose CDS was prescribed for the same patient at a single office visit.

12. The Respondent inadequately monitored the 20 patients for their use of CDS by
failing to conduct a sufficient number of laboratory testing for CDS levels. The Respondent also
failed to compose any plans for tapering the use of CDS, for decreasing dependence on CDS, for
weaning off CDS altogether, or for working with the Respondent to develop therapies other than
continued use of CDS. On rare occasions when urine tests were conducted, the results of the tests
often revealed no CDS in fluids of patients to whom CDS were prescribed, indicating that the
patients were not taking the CDS that the Respondent prescribed.

13. Numerous urine tests revealed efforts by patients to mask the use of CDS, such as
using cocaine or methadone prior to a urine test. The Respondent’s patient records reveal no
mention of any effort by the Respondent to address concerns that the patients may be masking
their CDS use, or efforts to determine why, if CDS were prescribed, they were not revealed in
urine tests.

14. The Respondent’s records reveal no effort by the Respondent to determine if the
patients who were prescribed CDS were also receiving CDS prescriptions from other prescribers.

15. The Respondent issued prescriptions for opioids to patients to whom he had also
prescribed sedatives, muscle relaxers, and benzodiazepines. Sedatives, muscle relaxers, and
benzodiazepines, taken in combination with opioids, increases the risk of adverse consequences.

16. The Respondent did not prescribe emergency opioid reversal medication, such as

Narcan, to patients to whom he issued prescriptions for opioids.
