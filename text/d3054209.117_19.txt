. & Unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine[.]
Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)Gi) (Supp. 2016). Unprofessional conduct refers to
conduct that breaches rules or ethical codes of professional conduct, or is conduct unbecoming a
member in good standing in the profession. Finucan v. Maryland Bd. of Physician Quality
Assurance, 380 Md. 577, 593 (2004).

In a physician disciplinary proceeding, the Act, at Section 14-405(b)(2), places upon’

the State the burden of proving its charges by a preponderance of the evidence. For the reasons

- set forth below, I conclude the State has satisfied its burden with respect to the charges under the
Act at § 14-404(a)(3)Gi).
Arguments of the Parties /

The State argued the Respondent engaged in unprofessional conduct in the practice of
medicine towards both S.W. and S.B., who were acting in their professional capacity as health
care workers on the relevant dates. The Respondent was verbally aggressive and physically
intimidating towards S.W. on December 5, 2015, and made remarks to her about her religious’
faith that were bigoted and inappropriate. The Respondent farther bebaved unprofessionally
when he locked Patient A, who was S.W.’s responsibility, in the examination room and refused
to give S.W. access to Patient A. By doing this, the Respondent interfered with the relationship
between'S.B. and Patient A as healthcare worker and client.

According to the State, the Respondent’s treatment of S.B. was equally unprofessional.
He raised his voice to her, swore at her, advanced towards her in a physically threatening manner
and physically assaulted her by pushing her in the shoulder and shoving a wheelchair into her:
The Respondent’s behavior was an extreme overreaction to his perception that S.B. was not

helping him deal with Patient B. Further, the Respondent again interfered in the health care
