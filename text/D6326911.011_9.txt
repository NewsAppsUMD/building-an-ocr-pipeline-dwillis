Respondent is not habitually intoxicated. The State also took exception to the ALI’s
recommendation that the summary suspension order be reversed.
a. Is the Respondent professionally, physically, or mentally incompetent?

The State contends that the ALJ erred by concluding that the Respondent is not
professionally, physically, or mentally incompetent. The State argues, essentially, that the
Respondent was physically incompetent when he was intoxicated, which, the State maintains, was
often. The Panel, however, is not convinced that the incompetency ground, Health Occ. § 14-
404(a)(4), was intended to apply when a physician’s intoxication occurs while practicing, or
attempting to practice, medicine on only a couple of occasions. Of course, if a physician practices,
or attempts to practice, medicine while intoxicated, the physician implicates other disciplinary
grounds, such as Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii) (unprofessional conduct in the practice of
medicine) and § 14-404(a)(9) (providing professional services while under the influence of alcohol
or while using a CDS is excess of therapeutic amounts or without valid medical indication). Thus,
while the Respondent’s intoxication when working subjects him to discipline by a Board panel, it
did not render him incompetent for purposes of discipline under Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(4). The
State’s exception concerning Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(4) is denied.

b. Is the Respondent habitually intoxicated?

The State contends that the ALJ erred by concluding that the Respondent was not habitually

State’s exception.

but, nonetheless, the charge of habitual intoxication was proven in this case. The significance of
