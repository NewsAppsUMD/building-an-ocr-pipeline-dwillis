II. COMPLAINTS
COMPLAINT I

4, On September 18, 2019, the Board received a written complaint from a
parent (“Parent 1”) of a former patient (“Patient 1”) of the Respondent. The Respondent
had treated Patient 1 for eight years, from the age of five to 13 years old.

5, Patient 1 initially presented to the Respondent in 2011, to be examined for
possible color-blindness. The Respondent confirmed that Patient 1 was color-blind and
also diagnosed Patient 1 with astigmatism.? For the latter condition, the Respondent
prescribed glasses.

6. In or around 2012, the Respondent diagnosed Patient 1 with amblyopia.

2 Astigmatism is the result of an irregularly shaped cornea or lens that prevents light from
focusing properly on the retina. It causes distorted or blurred vision at any distance.
