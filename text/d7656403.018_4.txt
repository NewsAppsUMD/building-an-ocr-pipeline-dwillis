Dr. Rajaratnam did not deny that he revoked his agreement to participate with
MPRP, nor does he deny that he failed to schedule an appointment or meet with the
psychiatrist as MPRP required for evaluation and treatment. At the Show Cause
hearing, Dr. Rajaratnam’s counsel stated that “[t]here does not appear to be material
dispute of fact in this case” and “[w]e are not contesting a violation.”

Instead, Dr. Rajaratnam argued that his violation was because of a temporary
medical condition that caused cognitive impairment. He also claimed that he did not
schedule the appointment because he could not afford to pay the fee.

The State argued that Dr. Rajaratnam’s failure to meet with Dr. A constituted a
violation of the Consent Order and that his failure to comply with the terms of the MPRP
agreement warranted the revocation of his license. The State also argued that he was
discharged from MPRP not because he could not pay the fee, but rather because he
rescinded his participation in MPRP that he described as being signed under duress.
The State further stated that Dr. Rajaratnam attempted to set limits on the topics for his
meeting with Dr. A. Based on concerns of public health and safety, the State argued
that revocation or a letter of surrender were the only safe sanctions available to the
Panel.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Dr. Rajaratnam was required under condition “1” of the Consent Order to “fully
and timely cooperate and comply with all of MPRP'’s referrals, rules, and requirements,”
and to “fully participate and comply with all therapy, treatment, evaluations, and

toxicology screenings as directed by MPRP.”
