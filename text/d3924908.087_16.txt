reaction to nickel. The plan was for Flonase nose spray twice a day and for the patient to make a
follow up appointment as needed. The Respondent billed $250 under CPT code 99245.

The Respondent’s records of Patient 6 also contain a health insurance billing form for
services the Respondent claims he provided Patient 6 on April 15, 2014. It shows the
Respondent billed $250 for CPT code 99245, $100 for SP, and $2640 for a SPT (264 allergens
tested) for a total of $2990. For his summary of care, however, the Respondent identified the
dates of his treatment of this patient as “3/24/ to 3/31/14.” And the Respondent does not mention
in his summary any visit or services provided on April 15, 2014. Further, supplemental records
the Respondent provided the Board after the peer review reports included a note he signed,
regarding Patient 6 stating, “Patient was not seen in April 2014 and therefore no medical records
or billing to the insurance company.” (Resp. Ex. 17, at 464.) The Respondent, however,
submitted into evidence at the ALJ hearing several documents purporting to document services
he provided Patient 6 on April 15, 2014, including SPT results and progress notes.

services provided on April 24, 2014, which states that he billed $2640 for SPT (264 allergens),
$100 for a SP, and $250 under CPT code 99245 for a total of $2990. There is no indication from
any other record that the Respondent provided services to Patient 7 on that date. The document
states that the patient’s authorization for the release of medical records for processing the claim
is on file with the date July 18, 2014. The billing form is signed by the Respondent with the
signature date of April 24, 2014.

Patient 7 was 27 years old when she initially saw the Respondent on July 18, 2014. The
