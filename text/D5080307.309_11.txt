The Panel is extremely concerned about Dr. Halstead’s ability to competently practice
medicine, and the Panel’s sanction reflects Dr. Halstead’s disciplinary history as well as the
significant concerns identified by the supervising physician, Dr. Halstead has a long disciplinary
history with the Board reflecting multiple successive standard of care violations. Since the date
of the first Consent Order issued on May 2, 2013, the Board has expressed concerns about Dr.
Halstead’s core medical competencies, including his failure to order appropriate tests, document
histories, and conduct physical examinations.

To remediate his deficiencies, the Board has required Dr. Halstead to take a course in
primary care and two courses in medical recordkeeping. In his most recent October 2017 Order
After Show Cause, Dr. Halstead was also required to have monthly face-to-face meetings with a
supervising physician, a condition that he disregarded more often than not. Dr. Halstead admits
that he did not have face-to-face meetings with his supervisor on a monthly basis. Dr. Halstead
also admits that he still has deficiencies in his practice with physical examinations and
differential diagnoses. While he believes that he can improve with coursework, he admits that he
might need a “higher level, or maybe a more intense level” of training to improve.

Panel B agrees that Dr. Halstead needs a high level, more intense assessment and
education than can be provided by a peer supervisor and Panel B believes that Dr. Halstead
needs to undergo a comprehensive assessment and to enroll in an appropriate educational
program. Accordingly, the Panel will suspend Dr. Halstead’s medical license and order him to
undergo and complete a comprehensive assessment by the Center for Personalized Education for

Professionals (““CPEP”) and an educational intervention, if recommended by CPEP.
