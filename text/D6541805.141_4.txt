7. On September 30, 2019, the Respondent’s license to practice medicine in Maryland
expired.” Due to the pending action on the April 30, 2018 charges, his license was extended until
the action by the Board on the charges.

8. On November 5, 2019, Disciplinary Panel A of the Board adopted the ALJ’s
proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and ordered that the Respondent’s license be
suspended for a minimum of six months and ordered that he undergo an evaluation on whether he
could safely return to the practice of medicine.

Current Proceeding

9. On January 4, 2019, the Board received a complaint from the Maryland Department
of Health (“MDH”) Office of the Inspector General (“OIG”) that the Respondent was prescribing
large amounts of high-dose opioids, which are controlled dangerous substances (“CDS”), to
customers who were paying cash, many of whom had criminal histories involving CDS or who
were currently or previously enrolled in opioid dependence treatment programs. The OIG also
complained that many of the persons for whom the Respondent prescribed opioids were receiving
90 morphine milligram equivalents or more per day, which exceeded CDC guidelines, and that
many of the persons for whom the Respondent prescribed opioids lived at the same residential
address or were linked to common social media groups (i.e. they were Facebook friends). Based
upon the complaint, the Board immediately began an investigation into the Respondent’s practice.

10. In the period June 21, 2017 through January 31, 2019, the Respondent issued over
7,300 prescriptions for CDS. In the months of November 2018 through January 2019, 190 of those

prescriptions were for opioids.

? Under § 14-403 of the Health Occupations Article, the license of an individual regulated by the

Board may not “lapse by operation of law while the individual is under investigation or while
charges are pending.”
