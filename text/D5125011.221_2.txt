 

scheduled time of the Telephone Prehearing Conference. Dr. Kass did not appear for the May 18,
2021 Telephone Prehearing Conference via Google Meet as scheduled, nor did anyone appear on
his behalf. He did not request a postponement of the Telephone Prehearing Conference and did
not submit a Prehearing Conference Statement in advance of the Telephone Prehearing
Conference, as instructed. The State’s Prehearing Conference Statement was filed with the OAH
on April 26, 2021, as instructed.

After waiting fifteen minutes for Dr. Kass to appear via Google Meet as instructed, the ALJ
commenced the Telephone Prehearing Conference in his absence. The State, represented by the
Administrative Prosecutor, appeared, and made an oral motion for a default order against Dr. Kass,
which the ALJ took under advisement.

Under OAH’s rules of procedure, “[i]f, after receiving proper notice, a party fails to attend
or participate in a prehearing conference, hearing, or other stage of a proceeding, the judge may
proceed in that party’s absence or may, in accordance with the hearing authority delegated by the
agency, issue a final or proposed default order against the defaulting party.” COMAR
28.02.01.23A.

On December 9, 2020, the ALJ issued a Proposed Default Order. Upon consideration of
the record, the ALJ found that Dr. Kass had proper notice of the May 18, 2021 Telephone
Prehearing Conference and failed to appear and participate in the Telephone Prehearing
Conference. The ALJ proposed that the Panel find Dr. Kass in default, adopt as findings of fact
the statements set out in the allegations of fact section of the State’s charges and conclude as a
matter of law that Dr. Kass violated the Medical Practice Act, Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)qii), (11),
and (33) (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2020 Supp.) in the manner set forth in the State’s charges. The ALJ

proposed that Dr. Kass’s license to practice medicine in the State of Maryland be revoked.
