1995, ECFMG revoked or suspended both ECFMG certifications assigned to [Dr.
Akoda].

In August 1996, [Dr. Akoda] submitted a third application for ECFMG
certification, this time using the name “John Nosa Akoda.” Along with this third
application, [Dr. Akoda] submitted to ECFMG a false Nigerian passport in the
name of “John Nosakhane Charles Akoda.” Between 1996 and 1998, [Dr.
Akoda], as “John Nosa Akoda,” passed all three steps of the USMLE and
received ECFMG certification under the “Akoda” name.

After receiving ECFMG certification under the “Akoda” name, [Dr.
Akoda] applied for and was accepted into a residency program at [Facility A].° In
2000, [Facility A] learned that the SSN that [Dr. Akoda] used belonged not to
“Akoda” but rather to Igberase. [Dr. Akoda] was suspended from [Facility A’s]
residency program in August 2000 and ultimately dismissed in November 2000.

In 1999, Individual A applied for and obtained SSN XXX-XX-1623 (the
“1623 SSN”).

In 2006, [Dr. Akoda], using the name “John-Charles Akoda,” and the
1623 SSN assigned to Individual A, applied for residency at [Facility B]. In
March 2007, [Facility B] accepted [Dr. Akoda] into its residency program, and
asked [Dr. Akoda] to submit evidence of legal residence in the United States. In
response, [Dr. Akoda] submitted a false permanent resident card in the name “N.
Akoda, John Charles.”

In 2011, after completion of his residency at [Facility B], [Dr. Akoda],
using the name “Charles John Nosa Akoda” and the 1623 SSN, applied for
medical licensure with the Maryland Board of Physicians. In support of this
application, [Dr. Akoda] submitted a false permanent residence card, as well as a
false Nigerian passport. In September 2011, the Maryland Board of Physicians
granted the requested medical license to [Dr. Akoda] under the name “Charles
John Nosa Akoda,” and [Dr. Akoda] began practicing medicine in the field of
obstetrics and gynecology.

In 2012, [Dr. Akoda], using the “Akoda” identity, sought and obtained
medical privileges at [Facility C] in Maryland. To do so, [Dr. Akoda] submitted a
false permanent residence card, as well as a false Maryland driver’s license.

On March 1, 2012, [Dr. Akoda] submitted a Medicare Enrollment
Application to the Center of Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS”) using the
“Akoda” identity and the 1623 SSN. CMS denied [Dr. Akoda]’s application
based, in part, on CMS’s determination that [Dr. Akoda] did not provide an
accurate SSN.
