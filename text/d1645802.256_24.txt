9. Management of chronic pain often requires a multimodal approach that integrates
pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments such as rehabilitative measures and
interventional techniques. Close monitoring by a treating physician of opioid use by a patient is
essential to determine efficacy and to determine whether the patient is taking the medication as
prescribed. Monitoring is necessary in all patients, and particularly in patients who present a risk
of diverting’ medications or who may misuse or abuse opioid treatments,

10. Chronic pain is defined as persistent pain lasting longer than the time required for normal
tissue healing, which in non-cancer pain patients is generally defined as three months.

11. Opioid formulations are classified as short or long acting on the basis of their duration of
action. Short Acting Opioids (SAO) are distinguished from Long Acting Opioids (LAO) by a
more rapid increase and decrease in serum levels.

12. LAOs are formulated to release drug more gradually into the bloodstream or have a long

half-life for prolonged activity.
