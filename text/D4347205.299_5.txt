CDC! GUIDELINES

The pertinent provisions of the CDC guidelines provide:

1.

Nonpharmacologic therapy and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy are
preferred for chronic pain. Clinicians should consider opioid therapy
only if expected benefits for both pain and function are anticipated to
outweigh risks to the patient. If opioids are used, they should be
combined with nonpharmacologic therapy and nonopioid
pharmacologic therapy, as appropriate.

Before starting opioid therapy for chronic pain, clinicians should
establish treatment goals with all patients, including realistic goals for
pain and function, and should consider how opioid therapy will be
discontinued if benefits do not outweigh risks, Clinicians should
continue opioid therapy only if there is clinically meaningful
improvement in pain and function that outweighs risks to patient
safety.

Before starting and periodically during opioid therapy, clinicians
should discuss with patients known risks and realistic benefits of
opioid therapy and patient and clinician responsibilities for managing
therapy.

When opioids are started, clinicians should prescribe the lowest
effective dosage.

Clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage,
should carefully reassess evidence of individual benefits and risks
when considering increasing dosage to >50 morphine milligram
equivalents (MME)/day, and should avoid increasing dosage to >90
MME/day or carefully justify a decision to titrate dosage to >90
MME/day.

Clinicians should evaluate benefits and harms with patients within 1
to 4 weeks of starting opioid therapy for chronic pain or of dose
escalation. Clinicians should evaluate benefits and harms of continued
therapy with patients every 3 months or more frequently. If benefits
do not outweigh harms of continued opioid therapy, clinicians should
