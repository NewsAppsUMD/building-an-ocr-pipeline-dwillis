further sanctions on the Respondent, including additional probationary terms and conditions, or
reprimand, suspension, or revocation.

2. Under the probationary conditions of the Consent Order, the Respondent was
required to comply with the Medical Practice Act.

3. At the time the Respondent entered into the Consent Order, his practice consisted
