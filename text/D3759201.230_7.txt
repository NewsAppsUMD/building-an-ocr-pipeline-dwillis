Health Oce. §14-404(b)(2) mandates the automatic revocation of a physician’s medical
license when a disciplinary panel concludes that a physician was convicted of a crime involving
moral turpitude. The time for filing an appeal has passed, thus the revocation of Dr. Babaturk’s
license to practice medicine is required under that provision,
