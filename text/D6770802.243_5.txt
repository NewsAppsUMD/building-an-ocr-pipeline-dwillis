In response, the State summarized and expressed concerns about Dr. Andrews’s
disciplinary history since 2017 and the undisputed evidence of her most recent violation in 2022.

was notified of the evidence of her violation and requested reconfirmation of the results. Dr.
Andrews subsequently acknowledged her violation in a call to MPRP on September 19, 2022. The
State further argued that Dr. Andrews’s repeated non-compliance with her Rehabilitation

of time in the hope of deterring future violations. In addressing the information provided by the
State, Dr. Andrews confirmed that she had initially lied to the medical review officer at MPRP and
denied her violation on the phone, but then admitted the violation a few days later.
