concerns about the Respondent's prescribing practices after one of the Respondent’s
patients fainted in the pharmacy’s waiting room on August 4, 2016.
I. Board investigative findings

5. As part of its investigation, the Board obtained a series of patient charts
from the Respondent for review. The Board referred the patient charts and related
materials to its peer review entity for a practice review. The peer reviewers found
deficiencies in the Respondent's prescribing practices and recordkeeping, which
constituted violations of the Act.

6. The Respondent failed to meet appropriate standards for the delivery of
quality medical care, in violation of Health Occ. Il § 14-404(a)(22), and failed to keep
adequate medical records, in violation of Health Occ. II § 14-404(a)(40), as set forth in
the following patient summaries.

Patient A

7. Patient A, a woman then in her late-50s, began seeing the Respondent for
medical care in or around October 2015, with complaints of back and knee pain. The
Respondent prescribed high dosages of pain medications for prolonged periods of time,
including oxycodone 15 mg three times per day (“TID”); extended release morphine, MS
Contin 15 mg TID; and in addition, a benzodiazepine, alprazolam, 30 tablets per month.
The Respondent maintained Patient A on these medications for several months.

8. In or around July 2016, Patient A went to the emergency room with
symptoms of a drug overdose and was diagnosed with drug dependency issues. The
Respondent resumed prescribing high-dosage opioid medications to Patient A after this

incident.
