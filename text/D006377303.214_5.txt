The Respondent would often ask Board staff to repeat their questions.

16. During the interview, the Respondent discussed her medical and medication
history. When Board staff asked the Respondent to address her practice of initiating
discussions with patients on her views of religious doctrine, she stated that she tells her
patients to pray to Jesus. After Board staff concluded recording the interview, the
Respondent continued to make several comments about religious subjects, including that
she “loves God” and “loves Jesus.”

17. About two hours after concluding the interview, the Respondent returned to
the Board’s offices and stated that she had lost her cell phone. Board staff helped the
Respondent look for the cell phone but could not find it. While standing near the building
elevators, the Respondent again told Board staff that she “loves God” and hopes that was
made clear no matter what she said during the interview. In response to Board staff stating
that they would inform the Respondent if they found her cell phone, the Respondent stated,
“God is magnificent” and to always remember that.
