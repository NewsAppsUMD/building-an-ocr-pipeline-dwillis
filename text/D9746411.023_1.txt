Maryland Board of Physicians, 4201 Patterson Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland 21215. If such a
hearing is requested, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set the hearing to

begin within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.081, though the 30-day requirement
may be waived.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel A resulting from

formal disciplinary action and is, therefore a public document.

Sincerely,
