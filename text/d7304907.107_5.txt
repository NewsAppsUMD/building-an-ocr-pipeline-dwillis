Felsenberg, 351 Md. 288, 295 (1998) (crimes involving fraud are crimes involving moral
turpitude); Attorney Grievance Comm’n v. Klauber, 289 Md. 446, 457-59, cert. denied, 451 U.S.
1018 (1981) (the term “moral turpitude” connotes a fraudulent or dishonest intent); Attorney
Grievance Comm’n v. Walman, 280 Md. 453, 459-60 (1977) (a crime of moral turpitude is
characterized by dishonesty, fraud, or deceit); Oltman v. Maryland State Bd. of Physicians, 162
Md. App. 453, 485-87, cert. denied, 389 Md. 125 (2005) (crime was one of moral turpitude
[because] it was dishonest, and characterized by fraud).

It is also settled that “the related group of offenses involving intentional dishonesty for
purposes of personal gain are crimes involving moral turpitude.” Oltman, 162 Md. App. at 486
(citations and quotation marks omitted). By using false social security numbers to open bank
accounts, apply for federal education loans for his children and obtain a medical license, Dr.
Akoda intended to defraud and deceive the government and Board for purposes of personal
financial gain to which he was not entitled. His conduct involved repeated fraud, deceit, and
intentional dishonesty for purposes of his own personal gain. The facts underlying Dr. Akoda’s
criminal offenses, therefore, also establish moral turpitude. Oltman, 162 Md. App. at 486.

‘In the instant case, Dr. Akoda was convicted of social security number fraud, in violation
of 42 U.S.C. § 408(a)(7)(B). Dr. Akoda was intentionally dishonest in committing an act of
willful deception on a massive scale for a prolonged duration of time for purposes of his own
personal financial gain. Panel B concludes that Dr. Akoda was convicted of a crime involving
moral turpitude and the time for filing an appeal has passed, thus the revocation of Dr. Akoda’s

license to practice medicine is required under Health Occ. § 14-404(b)(2).
