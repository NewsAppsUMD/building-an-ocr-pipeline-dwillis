§§ 1-102, 14-205. Among its duties, the Board is responsible for overseeing licensing,
investigating complaints, ‘and disciplining physicians. ‘Health Occ. §§ 14-205, 14-401. The |
Board’s disciplinary powers include reprimanding a physician, placing a physician on probation,
‘or suspending or revoking a physician’s license. Id, § 14-404. The grounds on which the Board
may take such disciplinary action include, as relevant here, unprofessional conduct in the
practice of medicine; willfully making or filing a false report or record in the practice of .
medicine; and violating any provision of the Maryland Medical Practices Act, any rule or
regulation adopted by the Board, or any State or federal law pertaining to the practice of
medicine, Id.§ 14-404(a)(3)Gi), (11), (43). The Board’s disciplinary authority is subject to the
physician’s right to a-hearing prior to imposition of the disciplinary action, Id. §§ 14-404(a), 14-
405(a).

Neither the Maryland Medical Practices Act nor the regulations governing disciplinary
and licensing proceedings before the Board specifically set out and allocate the burden of proof
at a hearing on disciplinary charges. When not otherwise provided by statute or regulation, the
standard of proof in a contested case hearing before the OAH is a preponderance of the evidence,
and the burden of proof rests on the party making an assertion or aclaim. Md. Code Ann., State
Gov't § 10-217 (2021); Comm'r of Labor and Indus, y, Bethlehem Steel Corp., 344 Md. 17, 34-
(1996) (citing Bernstein v. Real Estaté Comm'n, 221 Md, 221, 231 (1959)),; COMAR
28,02.01.21K. Accordingly, the State bears the burden of proving the alleged charges against the
Respondent. That is, the State must show that it is “more likely so than not,” when all the .
evidence is considered, that the Respondent committed the violations with which he is charged.
