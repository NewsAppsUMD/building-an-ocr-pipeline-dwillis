dependable, hardworking, and an asset to the organization. She stated that she has no current
plans to leave that job or to work in Maryland but hopes to correct her status in the National
Practitioner Data Bank by obtaining license reinstatement in Maryland which would enable her
to pursue professional opportunities and successfully apply in other states with perfusionist
licensure requirements in the event she decides to move or travel to another state.

With respect to steps she has taken to prevent recurrence of the conduct that led to the
2016 Consent Order, Ms. Harben answered that she moved back home to Indiana where her
parents live. She stated that in addition to her full-time job as a perfusionist there, she has “a
strong support system and spiritual community,” and attends church and recovery group
meetings often at her church. Since her surrender, she has continuously submitted the requisite
Continuous Education and Clinical hours to the American Board of Cardiovascular Perfusion to
remain certified.

On March 27, 2023, the State responded to Ms. Harben’s application for reinstatement,
and summarized her disciplinary and employment history prior to the surrender of her Maryland
license. The State noted that Ms. Harben did not make excuses for the conduct that led to her
2016 Consent Order and commended her for her successful continuation and completion of
MPRP’s referrals and recommendations in 2016 and 2017. Nevertheless, the State pointed out
that except for Ms. Harben’s reference to a strong support system and spiritual community in
Indiana, there was no documented record of her continued progress in that regard since 2018.
