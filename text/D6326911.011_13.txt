The Panel grants the State’s exception. The issue before the ALJ on the summary
suspension was whether the summary suspension was imperatively required when it was issued,
see Board of Physician Quality Assurance v. Mullan, 381 Md. 157, 171-73 (2004), not whether
the summary suspension should remain in effect based the Respondent’s condition at the time of
the evidentiary hearing.

The information, however, that the ALJ mostly relied upon to reverse the summary
suspension was relevant to the sanction imposed for the Respondent’s violation of the § 14-404(a)
disciplinary grounds.

Pertaining to the order for summary suspension, issued on November 5, 2020, the Panel
concludes that the summary suspension of the Respondent’s license was imperatively required in
order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public, and is affirmed. Panel A, however,
terminates the order for summary suspension, because the Panel has determined the appropriate
sanction for the Respondent’s violation of § 14-404(a)(3)(ii), (7), (8), and (9) of the Health
Occupations Article.
