109. During her December 16, 2013 examination, Patient 3 told the Respondent that
her pain was not being controlled and, in fact, was increasing. She also reported numbness in her
feet. The Respondent replied that he wanted to examine Patient 3, and Patient 3 agreed to the
examination. (Test. Patient 3, T. at 36; State’s Ex. 20 at 11.)

110. . Patient 3 had been sitting on an examination table. The Respondent directed
Patient 3 to get off the table and stand up. He stood behind Patient 3 and had her lower her pants
below her buttocks and began pressing up and down her spine, toward the bones that protrude
from each side of the spinal column. Patient 3’s underwear was below the cheeks of her buttocks.

111. The Respondent stood behind Patient 3 and began examining her hips. As he
conducted that examination, he caused Patient 3 discomfort by pressing on a soft spot in her _
pelvic region. A discussion ensued between the Respondent and Patient 3 about whether Patient
3 was experiencing pelvic pain as opposed to hip pain. (Test. Patient 3, T. at 36.)

pushing up between her legs on both sides and up in between her legs. (Test. Patient 3, T. at 36-
37.)

113. When Patient 3 realized the Respondent was about to put his fingers near her
vagina, she told him, “I do.not like where you’re at.” The Respondent did not stop pressing
around Patient 3’s vaginal region, nor did he say anything about what he was doing or why he
was doing it. (Test. Patient 3, T. at 37.)

114. The Respondent pressed twice on one side of Patient 3’s vagina and then pressed

twice on the other side of it. (Test. Patient 3, T. at 37.)
