Re: Christian Millett, M.D.
Case No.: 2221-0084
License No.: D73060

Dear Dr. Millett and Counsel:

On June 30, 2021, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued
an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE
in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2). On July 14, 2021, Dr.
Millett was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing before Disciplinary Panel
A to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. Dr. Millett attended the hearing
on that date and was represented by counsel, Tamara Miller, Esquire. The State was represented
by Michael Brown, Assistant Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor. Both parties
presented oral arguments at the post-deprivation hearing,

After considerations of the parties’ presentations, Disciplinary Panel A determined, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the health, welfare, and safety of the public imperatively
required the disciplinary panel to summarily suspend Dr. Millett’s license and that there exists a
substantial risk of serious harm to the public health, safety or welfare in Dr. Millett’s continued
practice. Disciplinary Panel A thus will not lift the summary suspension order and the summary
suspension imposed on June 30, 2021, is reaffirmed and continues. See COMAR
10.32.02.08H(1).
