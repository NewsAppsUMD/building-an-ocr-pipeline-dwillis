 

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, Dr. Babaturk has the right to request a full evidentiary
hearing before an Administrative Law Judge. This request will be granted if the Board receives
a written request for the hearing within ten days of the date of this letter. Any request for a
hearing should be sent to Christine Farrelly, Executive Director, at the Boardâ€™s address. If Dr.
Babaturk requests such a hearing, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set
the hearing to begin within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08 I, though Dr.
Babaturk may waive that 30-day requirement.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel A resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Pperely yours,

  

Christine A. Farrelly,
Maryland State Board o'
