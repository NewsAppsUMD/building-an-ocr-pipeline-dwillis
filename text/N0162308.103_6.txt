responded by acknowledging that he worked as a nuclear medicine technologist at the facility
while suspended, claiming that “{d]uring my suspension I was only there a hand full of times.”

On March 20, 2023, MPRP reported to the Board that Mr. Henson was reminded by MPRP
during his enrollment process that he was unable to work in Maryland as a nuclear medicine
technologist based on the August 2022 Order suspending his license. MPRP also informed the
Board that Mr. Henson indicated his understanding of the suspension and that part of his
enrollment with MPRP was complying with all aspects of his Order. Because Mr. Henson
continued to work as a nuclear medicine technologist during his suspension without disclosing this
fact, MPRP informed Mr. Henson that he was not in compliance with his rehabilitation plan and
closed his case for cause effective March 20, 2023.

On April 19, 2023, Panel A issued a Violation of Board Order and Notice to Show Cause
charging Mr. Henson with violating the August 2022 Order and his Participation Agreement with
MPRP. The charges were based on the Board’s investigation revealing that he practiced as a
nuclear medicine technologist, held himself out to the public as a current provider of nuclear
medicine technology services, and/or performed acts that required an active nuclear medicine
technology license, from August 23, 2022, through February 22, 2023, while his license was
suspended,

Third Show Cause Hearing: July 12, 2023

On July 12, 2023, Panel A held a show cause hearing at which Mr. Henson appeared. He
stated he did not know that his work at the Facility and being on-call as a nuclear medicine
technologist from August 23, 2022, through February 22, 2023, were actions that violated the

August 2022 Order.
