On or about March 31, 2015, the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the
“Board’) received an Application Form for Reinstatement of Medical Licensure (the
"Reinstatement Application") from ERIK S. KASS, M.D., License Number D51250 (the
"Respondent"). Based on its ensuing investigation of the Reinstatement Application,
the Board determined that it had grounds to charge the Respondent under the Maryland
Medical Practice Act (the “Act”), Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. Il (“Health Occ. II”) §§ 14-
101 ef seq. (2014 Repl. Vol.).
Specifically, the Board determined that it had grounds to charge the Respondent
with violating the following provision of the Act:
§ 14-601 Practicing without a license.
Except as otherwise provided in this title, a person may not
practice, attempt to practice, or offer to practice medicine in this
State unless licensed by the Board.

Prior to the issuance of charges, the Respondent agreed to enter into this public

Consent Order consisting of Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order.
