standard of care. I agree with Dr. Rafi and Dr. M. Browne that conduct that does not meet the
standard of care is unprofessional conduct.

In addition, I find the Respondent’s inability to produce medical records requested by the
Board on October 7, 2014 constituted unprofessional conduct. As the State noted, the
Respondent has been on notice since July 2012 that he needed to improve his record keeping. At
a minimum, the Respondent should have been aware that he needed to be able to access his
medical records promptly. The Respondent gave the Board a handwritten appointment log that
contained only patient initials on October 16, 2014. He did not provide an appointment log with
patient names until November 20, 2014. Finally, he did not provide Patient A’s medical record
to the Board until January 6, 2015. The Respondent’s delay in producing those records was
inexcusable and unprofessional. Therefore, I find the evidence shows that the Respondent’s
actions constituted unprofessional conduct.
Sanction

The State argued that the aggravating factors in this case include the Respondent’ s
extensive disciplinary history. The State asserted the Respondent has been disciplined by the
Board for unprofessional conduct, violations of the standard of quality care, and for inadequate
recordkeeping. The State contended that the Respondent’s actions were deliberate, had the
potential for harm, and were part of a pattern of detrimental conduct. The State alleged Patient A
was vulnerable, from another country,!® and sought a late term abortion for a fetus with
abnormalities; she was not aware that the fetus had died when she presented to the Respondent.
The State maintained that the Board had made previous attempts to rehabilitate the Respondent
and has been unsuccessful. The State argued that there were no mitigating factors. The State

recommended revocation of the Respondent’s medical license.

16 Patient A is from Denmark.
