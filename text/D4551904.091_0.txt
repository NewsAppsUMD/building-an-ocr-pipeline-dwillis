FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
BACKGROUND

On February 28, 2020, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
(“Board”) charged Julian Pappy Choe, M.D. with unprofessional and immoral conduct in the
practice of medicine and the Board’s sexual misconduct regulations. See Md. Code Ann., Health
Occ. (“Health Occ.”) § 14-404(a) (3)(i), Gi), COMAR 10.32.17.

The case was forwarded to the Office of Administrative Hearings (“SOAH”) for an
evidentiary hearing and a proposed decision. On October 6-7, 2020, a hearing was held before an
Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) at OAH. At the hearing, the State presented testimony from
one of Dr. Choe’s patients and a Board staff member. Dr. Choe appeared with counsel, testified
on his own behalf, and presented testimony from three fact witnesses.

On December 29, 2020, the ALJ issued a proposed decision concluding that Dr. Choe is
guilty of unprofessional and immoral conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation of Health
Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(i) and (ii), and that Dr. Choe violated the Board’s sexual misconduct
regulations, COMAR 10.32.17. The ALJ proposed that the Board’s charges be upheld and
recommended that the Board reprimand Dr. Choe, order him to pay a fine of $10,000.00, and
require him to complete a course in appropriate boundaries and use a chaperone whenever he is

treating female patients.
