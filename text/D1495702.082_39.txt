. p. 132.) The Respondent later testified that on that last visit, Patient B had achieved a good
result, “had no complaints and felt completely satisfied with the result of her treatment.”
_ (Transcript, p. 136)

I do not find the Respondent’s testimony credible. His two prior statements indicate that
a relationship outside the office began to develop almost immediately between the Respondent
and Patient B over their mutual interest in art. The Respondent’s own statements support that a
sexual relationship with Patient B occurred while she was a patient. He claimed that it was not
until he went through Patient B’s medical records that he was able to see when the doctor-patient
relationship stopped and the romantic relationship began. This statement appears to be
, inconsistent with the facts and self-serving, It is also not supported by Patient B’s June 23, 2005
medical record which shows no indication that she had reached “completely satisfactory results”
and ended treatment. In fact, the Respondent sent Patient B for lab work and advised her to
return in four months. (Bd. Ex. 7, p. 109.)

Furthermore, even if I weré to accept that June 23, 2005 was the last time the Respondent
saw Patient B in his office, the Respondent admitted that he continued to provide her with
treatment through prescriptions for years during and after their sexual relationship and failed to
document it in her medical records. The Respondent also admitted that Patient B’s file had been
“thinned” and no longer contained “every piece of paper.” (Transcript, p. 161-62.) In addition,

: the Respondent admitted to having a romantic relationship with Patient B within three months of
her June 2005 appointment, hardly a vast separation of time. Further, Patient B’s records do not

demonstrate that the physician-patient relationship was terminated.
