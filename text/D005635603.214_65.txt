 

I like that.” Individual 4 was uncomfortable and did not know if she knew who the Respondent
was.

79. Shortly after Individual 4 began working part-time in the OR, the Respondent
walked by her and said he was going to call her “Strawberry” as a nickname, which he did not
explain but which was an apparent reference to her strawberry blonde hair. He called her
Strawberry in passing once or twice a day while she was working in the OR, which was two days
a week. Individual 4 found the nickname distracting.

80. While Individual 4 was an EVS OR aide, the Respondent told her, “For a skinny
girl you have a really nice butt.”

81. The Respondent brought Individual 4 coffee twice after she asked him not to. He
asked her three times if she wanted to go to the nearby Starbucks with him. She declined each
time.

82. On one occasion, the Respondent called Individual 4 from a phone about 15 feet
away from Individual 4’s area and asked her to come over and sit on his lap. She responded by
asking the Respondent if he knew the phones were recorded (they were not).

83. Individual 4 reported to the Hospital’s director of perioperative services that the
Respondent was making her uncomfortable by calling her Strawberry and sitting down next to her
desk, and it was making her anxious at work. She did not mention that he asked her to sit on his
lap because she felt she had handled it by indicating to him that the phones were recorded. .

84, The director of perioperative services listened and said that she would supervise
Individual 4 better and keep an eye on the Respondent.

85. Another time, the Respondent commented approvingly on a tank top Individual 4

was wearing under her scrubs.
