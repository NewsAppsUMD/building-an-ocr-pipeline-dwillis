her supervisor. The ALJ considered Ms. Hernandez’s testimony that she was discriminated against
and the testimony of her supervisor to the contrary. After considering the testimony of both
witnesses and Ms. Hernandez’s employment file, the ALJ credited the testimony of her supervisor
and concluded that the Hospital did not discriminate against Ms. Hernandez. The ALJ noted that
the Hospital could have fired Ms. Hernandez long before she resigned based on her documented
patient care and unprofessionalism issues, but the Hospital instead extended her probationary
status and provided her many opportunities to improve. Even if the allegations of favoritism and
hostile work environment were true, they have no bearing on Ms. Hernandez’s many clinical
deficiencies documented by the Hospital.

Ms. Hernandez also argues that the ALJ improperly discounted the testimony of her
witness, a fellow respiratory care practitioner at the Hospital, who testified that the supervisor had
favorites and treated employees differently. The ALJ did not find the testimony credible because
the witness rarely worked the same shift as Ms. Hernandez and she had little personal knowledge
of any of the events described by the supervisor. The co-worker’s testimony did not concern events
that she observed, but rather was a second-hand recounting from incidents reported to the co-
worker by Ms. Hernandez. The Panel adopts the ALJ’s credibility determinations and agrees with
the ALJ’s decision to discredit the testimony. Despite any allegations of favoritism or Ms.
Hernandez’s assertion that she was being given harder assignments, the weight of the evidence
demonstrates that Ms. Hernandez was unable or unwilling to complete the basic tasks of her job.
Ms. Hernandez’s exception is denied.
