application related to the practice of medicine, in violation of Health Occ. § 15-314(a)(36).
SANCTION

Physician assistants must disclose accurate information on applications to enable the
Board and hospital credentialing committees to make informed decisions about the qualifications
of applicants and prospective employees. Mr. Gbadamosi’s false responses on his applications
prevented the Board and employers charged with the protection of the public from performing
their responsibilities. For the Board to implement its mandate, it is vital that all physician
assistants understand their obligation to disclose accurate and truthful information on licensure
applications. In failing to disclose this information, Mr. Gbadamosi ignored his legal obligations.
Such a troubling pattern of deliberate concealment and dishonesty weakens the public trust, and
has the potential to be very detrimental to public safety, Mr. Gbadamosi’s lack of candor
undermines public confidence in the integrity and dignity of the physician assistant profession,
dishonors the reputation of the great majority of physician assistants who practice with honesty,
and is inconsistent with the honesty required to maintain the privilege of licensure.

The panel has broad discretion to impose a sanction it deems appropriate in individual
cases. In view of the willful and deceptive nature of Mr. Gbadamosi’s repetitive behavior, the
panel will suspend Mr. Gbadamosi’s license for one year and impose a fine of $5,000.00,

ORDER
Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, it is, by an affirmative

vote of a majority of the quorum of Board Disciplinary Panel B, hereby:
