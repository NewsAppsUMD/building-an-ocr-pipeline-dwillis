Finally, the Panel’s findings of wrongdoing go well beyond the sexual relationship
alone. Dr. Singhal engaged in many actions that were immoral and unprofessional and part of
the pursuit of Patient 1’s wife, but were not merely sexual in nature. Dr. Singhal’s exploitative
conduct, such as his attempts to create “space” between Patient | and Patient 1’s wife, Dr.
Singhal’s knowledge of the personal and private information related to Patient 1’s sex life with
Patient 1’s wife, Dr. Singhal’s visiting their home and taking Patient 1’s wife on a lengthy car

professional misfortunes were all equally immoral and/or unprofessional. As part of the totality
of his conduct in this case, Dr. Singhal’s sexual relationship with Patient 1’s wife was immoral
and unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine.

SANCTION
