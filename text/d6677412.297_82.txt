physicians who were practicing under his supervision. I infer that DR that the

Respondent’s examination methods were such that patients might have falsely believed they
were of a sexnal nature, when in fact they were not, When he testified, D1 Roane:
that he imposed the strict chaperone policy on the Respondent because he wanted to make sure
that when the Respondent performed “below-the-belt” physical examinations of female patients
(those that might involve the buttocks, vagina, or rectum) those patients would not erroneously
conclude that the Respondent’s examination was sexual in nature..(Test. a T. at 547.)
Nevertheless, when the Respondent examined Patient 2, six months later on August 24, 2014, he
did not use a chaperone.

Patient 2 visited the Respondent ie on August 18, 2014 for

treatment of spine-related pain. Her primary care physician, Dr. | eta the

- Respondent, because he knew he had been successful in treating patients with chronic back pain.

Patient 2 testified that after she had series of x-rays, a nurse escorted her into a small

examination room, which allowed its door to be closed for patient privacy. Patient 2 was fully
clothed, wearing blue jeans and a white shirt. She did not have to dress in a hospital gown. After
Patient 2 explained the kinds of back problems she was having, the Respondent examined her. |
First, he had her perform the leg exercises on the examination table. Then he had her stand up
facing toward the door. He was behind Patient 2. It is unclear at this point whether he was
wearing gloves. He then palpated Patient 2’s spine from her neck to her abdomen. He pressed
down at various places on Patient 2’s spine, asking her if it hurt at each pressure point. She only

described pain when the Respondent started pressing in her waist area.
