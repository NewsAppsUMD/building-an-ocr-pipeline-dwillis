the schedule IV CDS to her on one occasion, prior to a surgical procedure in January
2014?

12. In furtherance of the Board's investigation, the Board issued a subpoena duces
tecum for the Respondent's medical record from Physician A. A review of the
Respondent's medical record revealed that Physician A documented that on December
18, 2013, he gave the Respondent a prescription for schedule IV CDS, as well as other
medications related to her surgery.

13. On or about March 4, 2016, a member of the Board's staff interviewed Witness A,
the human resources director for Practice A. Witness A provided the name of the
medical assistant who was working with the Respondent on August 7, 2014. The
medical assistant denied that the Respondent or anyone else asked her to destroy the
schedule IV CDS prescription. The medical assistant found the schedule IV CDS
prescription on August 8, 2014 and brought it to her manager's attention.

14. Witness A further stated that the Respondent could have asked any of the
providers at Practice A to examine her and prescribe the necessary medications.

15. The Board also issued a subpoena duces tecum to Practice B, where the
Respondent received primary care services, for her medical record and a list of any and
all medications prescribed to the Respondent.

16. A review of Patient A's medical record from Practice B did not reveal any note or
addendum documenting the Respondent's allegedly erroneous prescription for the

schedule IV CDS on August 7, 2014.

? Based on pharmacy records, it appears that Physician A prescribed the schedule IV CDS with one refill,
which the Respondent used on March 30, 2014.
