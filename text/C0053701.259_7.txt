Ul. PATIENT-RELATED FINDINGS

STANDARD OF CARE VIOLATIONS

10. The peer reviewer found the following deficiencies relating to nine patients
(Patients 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10) that relate in whole or in part to the Respondent's
failure to meet the standard of quality care for patients receiving opioids and/or
benzodiazepines and/or psychiatric medications. The peer reviewer found:

e The Respondent's inadequate use of random urine drug screening to
monitor for abuse or diversion of controlled dangerous substances (“CDS”)
(Patients 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10);

e The Respondent's early prescribing of CDS refills (Patients 1, 2);

e The Respondent's prescribing of CDS to patients for lost or forgotten
medications without documentation of warning or reiteration of policy
(Patients 1, 2);

e The Respondent's failure to obtain narcotics’ contracts (Patient 1, 3, 5, 7);

® The Respondent’s inappropriate prescribing of CDS to patients with a
history of substance abuse disorders (Patients 2, 6, 7);

e The Respondent's prescribing of opioids or other CDS including increasing
dosages without obtaining prior medical records from pain providers, mental
health providers, primary care providers or imaging studies substantiating
legitimate need for opioids (Patient 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10);

e The Respondent's prescribing for chronic pain and or psychiatric
medication management to patients in an acute care setting without
evidence of immediate danger to the patient (Patient 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9,
10),

e The Respondent's prescribing of opioids to patients concurrently with
another provider despite having access to CRISP (Patients 3, 4, 9, 10);

e The Respondent's failure to appropriately refer patients to pain
management providers (Patient 5); and/or

e The Respondent's failure to prescribe adjuvant therapies (Patient 5).

11. The Respondent's care as outlined above in whole or in part is evidence of the
Respondent's failure to meet the standard of quality medical care in violation of Health

Occ. § 15-314(a)(22).
