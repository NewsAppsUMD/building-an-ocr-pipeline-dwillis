2. On or about October 12, 2017 the Board received a written request from the
Administration, entitled “Request to Suspend or Deny License for Delinquent Child Support”
(the “Request”), which requested that the Board suspend the Respiratory Care Practitioner
license held by the Respondent for delinquent child support under the authority of Md. Code
Ann., Fam. Law § 10-119.3. The Request stated that, as of October 2, 2017 the arrearage
amount of child support that the Respondent owed was $9, 971.17 in the Administration’s case
numbered 010115932. |

that the Board suspend the license of the Respondent upon notification by the Administration and
after sending written notice to the Respondent of the proposed suspension of his license and of —
his right “to contest the identity of the individual whose license . . . is to be suspended.”

4. On October 17, 2017 the Board sent an unexecuted copy of this Order of
Suspension to the Respondent’s last known address registered with the Board (the same address
as that on the Request). Included with the unexecuted Order of Suspension was a letter notifying
the Respondent of his right to contest his identity, in writing to the Board, within thirty days of
the date of the letter; that is, to contest that he was not the Gerard J. Moore, L02597 named by
the Administration as the individual whose license should be suspended for delinquent child
support. In addition, the letter also gave Respondent written notice that if he did not submit to

the Board a signed, written appeal on or before November 16, 2017 the Board would execute this

Order of Suspension as written”

2 The letter also notified the Respondent that he could prevent the suspension of his registration by contacting the
Administration and arranging to pay the arrears in full within 15 days of the date of the letter.
