hearing before an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Administrative Hearings. This
request will be granted if the Board receives a written request for the hearing within TEN (10)
days of the date of this letter. Any request for a hearing should be sent to Christine A. Farrelly,
Executive Director, Maryland Board of Physicians, 4201 Patterson Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland
21215. If Ms. Chastain requests such a hearing, the regulations require that an Administrative

though Ms. Chastain may waive that 30-day requirement,

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel B resulting from
