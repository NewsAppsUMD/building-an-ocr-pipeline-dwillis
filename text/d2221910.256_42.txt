2014, the Respondent was well aware of specific improvements that he needed to make to his
record keeping but he failed to do so.
For all the above reasons, I find that the Respondent violated the standard of care and
engaged in unprofessional conduct.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Based on the above Findings of Fact and Discussion, I conclude that the Respondent
failed to meet appropriate standards for the delivery of quality medical and surgical care, in
violation of section 14-404(a)(22). Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(22) (Supp. 2015).
I further conclude that the Respondent is guilty of unprofessional conduct in the practice of
medicine, in violation of section 14-404(a)(3)(ii). Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 14-04(a)(3)(ii)
(Supp. 2015).
I further conclude that, as a result, the Board may discipline the Respondent by revoking
his license to practice medicine. Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 14-404(a) (Supp. 2015).
PROPOSED DISPOSITION
I PROPOSE that the charges filed by the Board against the Respondent for violation of
‘section 14-404(a)(3)Gi) and (a)(22) be UPHELD. I further PROPOSE that the Board revoke the
Respondent’s license to practice medicine.
