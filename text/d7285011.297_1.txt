instances described below, Disciplinary Panel B has reason to believe that the following

facts are true:

1.

At all times relevant hereto, the Respondent was and is licensed to practice
medicine in the State of Maryland. The Respondent was originally licensed to
practice medicine in Maryland on August 1, 2011. Her license is scheduled to
expire on September 30, 2017. The Respondent holds an active license in the
District of Columbia and inactive licenses in Massachusetts and Virginia.

The Respondent is board-certified in internal medicine and nephrology.

The Respondent was not employed as a physician at the time the Board received
a complaint regarding her.

On or about June 2, 2016, the Board received a complaint from an acquaintance
of the Respondent regarding the Respondent's conduct at a mutual friend’s
house. The complainant expressed concern that the Respondent may be a risk
to patients because of possible substance abuse.

Thereafter, the Board initiated an investigation. In furtherance of the Board’s
investigation, Board staff interviewed the complainant, former co-workers of the
Respondent and the Respondent. Board staff also obtained the Respondent's
quality assurance/personnel files from the Respondent's most recent former
employers.

On December 6, 2016, Board staff interviewed the Respondent under oath.
During the interview, the Respondent disclosed information that caused Board
staff to request that she sign a waiver to permit the Board to obtain health-related

medical records. The Respondent refused to sign the waiver.
