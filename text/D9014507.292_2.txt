3. The statement of facts that formed the basis of the guilty plea included the following:

From in or about March 2017 through in or about June 2020, in the
Eastern District of Virginia and elsewhere, the defendant, FARHAAD
RIYAZ, devised, knowingly intended to devise, and executed and attempted
to execute, a scheme and artifice to defraud Amazon and its on-line retailers,
and to obtain money and property by means of materially false and fraudulent
pretenses, representations, and promises, by making misrepresentations
concerning, among other things, the delivery of the products he purchased, the
condition of the products he purchased, and would at various times return
substitute products of substantially lower value than the items he had
purchased from the on-line retailer and had retained, while concealing the
material fact from the on-line retailer that he had retained the original, high-
end product.

To execute the scheme and attempt to execute it, RIYAZ would
frequently cause products to be shipped by private and commercial interstate
carriers, such as UPS and Amazon itself, RIYAZ would also cause inferior or
materially less expensive substitute products to be shipped back to Amazon
and its third-party resellers via UPS, as part of his scheme to defraud,
RIYAZ’s actions violated Title 18, United States Code, Section 1341, Mail
Fraud.

Defendant RIYAZ would purchase high-end products through
Amazon and its third-party retailers, who would then mail the products to
RIYAZ at one of his delivery addresses, including addresses in the Eastern
District of Virginia. These addresses included RIYAZ’s residence, or another
designated address affiliated with RIYAZ.

After the product arrived, RIYAZ would initiate the return process
with Amazon by claiming the products arrived late, never arrived at all,
arrived only in part, were defective, or some other allowable reason under
Amazon’s return policies.

Amazon would refund the purchase price to RIYAZ, but RIYAZ
would fraudulently retain the high-end product. RIYAZ would return to the
on-line retailer a much less expensive or inferior product that appeared to
resemble the high-end product that RIYAZ had retained. For instance, RIYAZ

 

represented to be or intimated or held out to be such counterfeit or spurious article, for the purpose
of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do, places in any post office or authorized
depository for mail matter, any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by the Postal
Service, or deposits or causes to be deposited any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered
by any private or commercial interstate carrier, or takes or receives therefrom, any such matter or
thing, or knowingly causes to be delivered by mail or such carrier according to the direction
thereon, or at the place at which it is directed to be delivered by the person to whom it is
addressed, any such matter or thing, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20
years, or both.
