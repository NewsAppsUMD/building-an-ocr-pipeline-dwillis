times.” Individual 4 was “petrified.” (T. 325.) Individual 4 did manage to leave the office
without touching Respondent’s penis. Individual 4 told her best friend at work about this
incident. Individual 4 also spoke to the Hospital’s perioperative director about her concerns
about the Respondent, although Individual 4 does not recall how specific she was. Individual 4
did not think her concerns were properly handled by the perioperative director.

the Hospital’s Human Resources department: “Fear, knowing that he had said to people before
that he, you know, kind of had control over jobs.”

22. Individual 4 and the Respondent were never in a romantic relationship together
and never had sex with each other, Individual 4 never demanded money from the Respondent,
and Individual 4 did not send a racy photograph of herself to the Respondent.

24. — In April 2017, Individual 5 observed the Respondent slap the buttocks of Patient
1. Individual 5 noticed that everyone who saw him slap the patient looked shocked. Individual
5 was interviewed by Board staff and said, “You know, that’s not typical behavior of a surgeon,
at least not a good one, and I do remember reporting it.” Individual 5 reported the incident to the
charge nurse, but stated, “And I don’t know that anything after that point was ever done.”
