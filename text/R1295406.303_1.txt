undeliverable. The scheduling order informed Ms. Atzeni-Dandrea that the failure to appear at the
prehearing conference could result in a decision against the party that fails to appear.

On March 9, 2023, the ALJ held the video prehearing conference. The administrative
prosecutor appeared on behalf of the State. Ms. Atzeni-Dandrea did not appear. After waiting
until 9:53 a.m., the ALJ commenced the prehearing conference. The ALJ noted that the scheduling
order was sent to Ms. Atzeni-Dandrea’s address of record and emailed to her, and neither
correspondence was returned as undeliverable. There was no request for postponement filed or
any other communication from Ms. Atzeni-Dandrea as to why she was unable to attend the hearing
or that she had any problems joining the video conference. The ALJ, thus, concluded that Ms.
Atzeni-Dandrea received proper notice of the prehearing conference, and the State made a motion
for a proposed default order pursuant to OAH’s regulations. .

Under OAH’s rules of procedure, “[i]f, after receiving proper notice as provided in
Regulation .0SC of this chapter, a party fails to attend or participate, either personally or through
a representative, in a prehearing conference, hearing, or other stage of a proceeding, the ALJ may
proceed in that party’s absence or may, in accordance with the hearing authority delegated by the
agency, issue a final or proposed default order against the defaulting party.” COMAR
28.02.01.23A.

On March 14, 2023, the ALJ issued a Proposed Default Order. The ALJ found that Ms.
Atzeni-Dandrea had proper notice of the March 9, 2023 video prehearing conference and that she
failed to appear or participate. The ALJ proposed that the Panel find Ms. Atzeni-Dandrea in
default, adopt as findings of fact the averments set out in the allegations of fact section of the

charges, and conclude as a matter of law that Ms. Atzeni-Dandrea violated Health Occ. § 14-5B-
