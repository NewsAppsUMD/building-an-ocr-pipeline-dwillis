unsubstantiated, Panel A finds that they did not arise from dishonesty or embellishment to
mislead the Board, but rather were understandably caused by Patient 1’s feeling of betrayal and
the loss of trust he had in his physician after he found out about Dr. Singhal’s sexual relationship
with his wife. In short, the Panel finds Patient 1 believed that Dr. Singhal may have
overmedicated him.

Finally, the ALJ found that Dr. Singhal’s recommendation to Patient 1 to separate
himself from his: family and pursue his hobbies by himself was not designed to purposefully
separate Patient | from his wife. The Panel disagrees. When he started treatment with Dr.
Singhal, Patient 1 complained that he had lost interest in hobbies and that he had tried to seclude
himself from everyone except his wife and kids. Patient 1 did not seek to separate himself from
his wife and had not expressed an interest in doing so. Dr. Singhal, nevertheless, used the
information to encourage Patient | to separate from his wife and kids when he was feeling down
and told him that he should give his wife space and pursue hobbies by himself rather than
spending time with his wife. The Panel finds that Dr. Singhal’s attempts to create more space
between Patient | and his wife were designed to estrange Patient 1 from his wife, laying the
groundwork for Dr. Singhal’s sexual pursuit of her.

Dr. Singhal’s inconsistent statements

In contrast to the statements by Patient 1, Dr. Singhal’s testimony was often inconsistent
but in a way that indicates a lack of honesty and demonstrates an attempt to minimize his poor
conduct. During the investigation interview, Dr. Singhal would mislead the Board and would
revise his statements once he realized that the Board already knew the truth.

First, Dr. Singhal made the same error as Patient 1 and initially claimed that his sexual

relationship with Patient 1’s wife overlapped with Patient 1’s medical appointments. Ina
