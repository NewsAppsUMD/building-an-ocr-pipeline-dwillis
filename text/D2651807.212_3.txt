10. After receiving this information, the Board requested that the Respondent address
the circumstances of his resignation from the Facility in a written response. By letter dated
November 9, 2021, the Respondent acknowledged resigning from the Facility, before
which he had been on a leave of absence. The Respondent stated that at the time of his
resignation, he was the subject of a Facility inquiry into whether he was engaging in
activities that were “not allowed during ... [his]... leave of absence.” The Respondent
stated that during his leave of absence, he continued to lecture on pediatric dermatology
issues to residents, students, and faculty for teaching purposes at various health care
facilities but was under the impression that his input was informal and not in the nature of

an official consultation.

Board interviews

ll. The Board interviewed several former and recent professional colleagues of the
Respondent who made observations about the Respondent’s clinical actions and behaviors
while on staff at the Facility. Those colleagues variously described instances where the
Respondent: expressed confusion about which patient he was seeing; repeated himself;
performed procedures without appropriate indication; misused or employed inappropriate
treatment modalities; treated patients without an established physician-patient relationship
or without obtaining appropriate informed consent; and made possible billing
errors. Senior staff members also stated that they received reports from trainees and staff

involving the Respondent’s clinical judgment with respect to patient care.
