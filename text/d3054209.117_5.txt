Based on the Findings of Fact, and for the reasons described above, the Panel concludes
that Dr. Dalton is guilty of unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation of
Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii).

SANCTION

The ALJ recommended a one-year suspension; referral to MPRP for MPRP to assess
whether any additional rehabilitative or remedial measures are necessary to address Dr. Dalton’s
conduct; a neurocognitive evaluation; and, after the suspension, that he appear before the Panel
for a determination of any further steps. Dr. Dalton takes exception to the proposed sanction,
arguing that the sanction is excessive and would effectively end his practice and close his clinic.
Dr. Dalton discusses the aggravating and mitigating factors from the Board’s Sanctioning
Guidelines and argues that the sanction is punitive and inconsistent with the mission of the
Board.

Dr. Dalton’s conduct was egregious and troubling. He admitted having thin skin and
being “easily provoked.” In his interview with the Board, Dr. Dalton suggested that S.W.
provoked him by wearing a burqa in his office. This rationalization is cause for concern. Based
on S.W.’s attire, Dr. Dalton initiated a non-germane conversation about the San Bernardino
shooting and then escalated the encounter to where he was yelling at and physically intimidating
her, ultimately locking her out from the patient she was attending while screaming at her to leave
his office. This response to S.W.’s burga deeply concerns the Panel. As a medical professional,
Dr. Dalton must be able to maintain his professionalism and composure even in stressful or
confrontational situations. That he became so angry and aggressive towards S.W. based on
nothing other than what she was wearing, leads the Panel to have grave concerns about his

ability to control himself in situations where any conflict might arise.
