and the Respondent’s personnel file. The Respondent did not testify about each of the specific
instances documented by Pera I found the Respondent’s testimony evasive, inconsistent
with the documents, and wholly inadequate to refute the State’s evidence.

The Respondent testified that she was discriminated against by Efza Eze
denied the allegation. I did not find any evidence of discriminatory treatment. On the contrary,
the undisputed record shows that the Respondent was given an extended probationary period,
access to the EAP, and many meetings with EE curing which the Respondent was
allowed to provide her explanation of events. The Respondent never filed a discrimination
complaint with HR, even though ees told her that HR would accept such a complaint.

It could be argued that BE ou. have been justified in terminating the
Respondent’s employment years before the Respondent resigned, o, EES gave the
Respondent many chances to improve her performance. The Respondent was never demoted or
suspended. I conclude that a: not discriminate against the Respondent. The
Respondent is making that allegation now as a disingenuous shield against the mountain of

evidence of her professional incompetence.

The Respondent’s witness, testified that the Respondent was treated

unfairly by BEEZ She stated that favorites who were given easier

assignments and allowed to watch television while on duty whereas the Respondent was given
harder assignments such as the ICU, I did not find Ezz. testimony credible. She
rarely worked on the same shift as the Respondent and had little personal experience with ary of
the situations documented in the record. Some of those incidents were alarmingly dangerous to

patients, yet the witness never addressed them or indicated any concerns for patient safety.
