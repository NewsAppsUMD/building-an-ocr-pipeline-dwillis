 

The final question is whether the Board may impose a civil penalty. “In addition to the
penalties under subsection (a) of this section, a person who vidlates § 15-401 of this subtitle may
be subject to a civil penalty assessed by the Board in an amount not exceeding $5,000. Health
Oce. § 15-403(b)(1). The State recommends a $5,000.00 penalty on the basis the Respondent’s
actions were serious and she acted for financial gain. .

. The only financial gain is the Respondent’s salary and performance bonus. If that
constitutes financial gain, any licensee who commits any violation is arguably acting for financial
gain. I do not find she acted for financial gain.

On the other hand, the Respondent’s actions were serious and careless, She stated without
appreciation for its meaning she ran a physician practice for months on her own, not only without a
delegation agreement but also without adequate supervision with Hospital A’s hierarchy. The
Respondent knew or should have known she did not have a delegation agreement Physician A and
absolutely knew she had not filed delegation agreements to replace Physician C and, thus, the
Respondent’s decision to practice without a supervising physician was willful. I therefore accept
the State’s recommended civil penalty.

With regard to payment of the penalty, “[a]n individual shall pay to the Board any fine
imposed under this regulation within 15 calendar days of the date of the order, unless the order
specifies otherwise.” COMAR 10.32.03.17G, [recommend the Board require the Respondent to

pay the penalty before the end of the suspension ends.
