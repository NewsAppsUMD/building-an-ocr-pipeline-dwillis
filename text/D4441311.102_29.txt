THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES

The State argued that the Board’s investigative findings established that the Respondent
engaged ina sexual relationship with Individual A during a time when he was treating her as a
patient, which constituted immoral and unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in
violation of the Act and COMAR 10.32.17.03D(1). .

. The Respondent argued that the State failed to establish that the ee in
sexual activity with Individual A while she was his patient. He maintained that an urgent care
shnithen does not have an ordinary relationship with a patient. An individual comes to the

- Facility for an illness or injury, but the urgent care physician does not provide any continuing |
medical care. The urgent care physician may send a patient for testing, or to the patient’s
primary care physician, or even to the hospital, but there is no expectation that the urgent care
physician will provide any continuing care. The Respondent said that he did Individual A’s lab
work in his office a few times, and he referred her for tests or to her other doctors after he
examiried her, but he was not her poe care sforition, Therefore, the crux of the
Respondent’s argument was ‘that Individual A was only a patient of the Respondent's during the
time on she was at the Facility receiving treatment.

At the conclusion of the State’s case, the Respondent moved for judgment, arguing that .

: the State failed to establish that the Respondent violated the Medical Practice Act or COMAR ,
10.32, 17.03D(1). I informed the parties that I would address the Motion Sor Judgment in this
decision. After. reviewing the joint exhibits, I conclude that the State presented sufficient

evidence to establish its prima facie case, and the Motion for Judgment is denied.
