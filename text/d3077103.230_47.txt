performed an auscultation of the Patient’s heart. He indicated there could be some inadvertent
touching of a breast, but not intentional. .

I conclude from a preponderance of the credible evidence that it is more likely than not
that the Respondent did not engage in sexual misconduct or immoral or unprofessional conduct
when examining Individual C. I found the Respondent’s denial to be credible for the reasons
explained above and there is no corroborating evidence of any behavior manifested by the ,
Respondent that would support a finding of sexual, immoral and unprofessional misconduct in
the practice of medicine, in violation of Section 14-404(a)(3)(i) and (ii) of the Health
Occupations Article and sexual misconduct, as prohibited by COMAR 10,.32,17.01 and .02B.
Individual D

On or about May 18, 2018, the Board received a complaint from Individual D involving
an incident that occurred in 2006 when the Respondent performed a rectal examination on him.
Individual D testified that the examination was very painful. The Respondent did not have a
specific recollection of the examination as it occurred in 2006, A review of the medical records

indicate that the examination occurred on September 27, 2006. The medical records also
indicate that at the time of the examination on September 27, 2006, Individual D experienced
soreness and tenderness of his rectum which was present before the examination took place.

Individual D claims that during the examination, he experienced great pain and requested
the Respondent cease the examination but that the Respondent would not stop examining
Individual D’s anus with his finger. The Respondent also claims that the experience with the
Respondent was so traumatic that he did not go back for any more visits with the Respondent.
However, the medical records indicate the Respondent examined Individual D multiple times

after the September 27, 2006 examination.
