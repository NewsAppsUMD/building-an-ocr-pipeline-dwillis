For all these reasons, I conclude that the State proved that the Respondent was
unprofessional in her conduct while employed oes

Respondent's Post-ME Employment

The State introduced evidence that the Respondent was employed by a number of health
care institutions after she ent en terminated from each job. Her personnel files were
obtained through Board subpoenas and admitted into evidence without objection from Ea

Fama) The Board argued that the files showed continued pattern of unprofessional and/or

incompetent performance by the Respondent.

I have not considered these records in reaching my decision for two reasons. First, in
most instances, the Respondent was terminated during her probationary period. Such
terminations occur for a variety or reasons, including the likelihood that the terminated employee

will have no legal recourse; hence, no risk of liability to the employer. I did not have the ability

to listen to a witness explaining if the Respondent was incompetent or unprofessional in her short

tenure with the subsequent employers.

Second, and more importantly, I have concluded that the State proved its case based on
the wealth of evidence about the Respondent’s time EE It is simply unnecessary for me
to consider files documenting her subsequent performance. Doing so might lead the Respondent
to believe that she was treated unfairly in this proceeding since she was unable to confront
anyone from her subsequent jobs to challenge what is contained in the files. It is important that
this proceeding be conducted with fairness to all parties. On balance, I conclude that
disregarding the personnel records of subsequent employment enhances that goal while not

impairing the Board’s ability to prove its case.
