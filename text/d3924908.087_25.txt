not meet with Patient 1 on March 24, 2014. The billing form also states that the authorization for
the release of records to process the claim is dated March 24, 2014, and is “on file,” although the
records do not contain an authorization from that date. Despite billing for $2990 for services to
Patient 1 on March 24, 2014, the Respondent did not provide services to Patient 1 that day.

The Respondent billed for April 15, 2014, visit with Patient 6, even though there was no
visit with Patient 6 that day. (St. Ex. 26, at 489.) The Respondent billed $250 under CPT code
99245, $2640 for a SPT for 264 allergens tested, and $100 for a SP with bronchodilator for a
total of $2990. The Respondent’s signature is on the billing with the signature date of April 15,
2014. The Respondent’s summaries do not reference a visit by Patient 6 on April 15, 2014. And
the records he produced in response to the Board’s subpoenas in March and July 2015 do not
contain any medical records confirming this visit. In fact, in the supplemental records the
Respondent produced in response to the peer review reports is a note signed by the Respondent
concerning Patient 6, stating, “Patient was not seen in April 2014 and therefore no medical
records or billing to the insurance company.” (Resp. Ex. 17, at 464.) The Respondent,
nonetheless, entered into evidence at the ALJ hearing several documents purporting to be
medical records from April 15, 2014. The Respondent submitted SPT results (Resp. Ex. 6 at
192-195) and progress notes (Ex. 6 at 218-219) concerning April 15, 2014. These documents
were not included in the medical records he submitted on either March 2, 2015, or in July 2015,
despite certifying on both those occasions that the records he submitted with each of those
certifications were the patient’s complete medical records. Nor were they even part of the
supplemental documents he produced in response to the peer review reports. These are false
medical records. The Respondent billed for services for Patient 6 for April 15, 2014, although

the Respondent did not provide services to Patient 6 on that date.
