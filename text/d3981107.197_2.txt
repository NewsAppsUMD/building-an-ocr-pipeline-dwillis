and offered the exhibits that it had planned to offer into evidence if the matter had proceeded to a
merits hearing. The ALJ admitted those exhibits into evidence. In the Motion, the State expressly
requested that the ALJ enter a proposed order of default and that the ALJ recommend that Dr.
Adams’s license to practice medicine be revoked. The Motion included a certificate of service,
dated January 9, 2017, certifying that a copy of the Motion was mailed to Dr. Adams at both his
Maryland and Pennsylvania addresses. Dr. Adams did not submit any opposition to the Motion.
COMAR 28.02.01.12B(3).

Under OAH’s rules of procedure, “[i]f, after receiving proper notice, a party fails to
attend or participate in a prehearing conference, hearing, or other stage of a proceeding, the judge
may proceed in that party’s absence or may, in accordance with the hearing authority delegated
by the agency, issue a final or proposed default order against the defaulting party.” COMAR
28.02.01.23A. Similarly, Health Occ. § 14-405 provides, in pertinent part:

(d) If after due notice the individual against whom the action is contemplated fails

or refuses to appear, nevertheless the hearing officer may hear and refer the matter

to the Board or a disciplinary panel for disposition.

(e) After performing any necessary hearing under this section, the hearing officer

shall refer proposed factual findings to the Board or a disciplinary panel for the

Board’s or disciplinary panel’s disposition.

Subsection (d) which provides that the ALJ “may hear” the matter if the individual fails to
appear, and subsection (e), which uses the language “any necessary hearing,” clearly
contemplate situations, such as defaults, where no hearing is required. See also COMAR
28.02.01.23A.

The ALJ found that Dr. Adams had proper notice of the January 9, 2017 prehearing

conference and that he failed to appear and participate in the prehearing conference.
