The Respondent was originally issued a license to practice nuclear medicine technology
in Maryland on November 23, 1994, under License Number N00470. The Respondent’s latest
license was given the expiration date of April 30, 2021.' At all times relevant to these charges,
the Respondent practiced as a nuclear medicine technologist at a health care facility (the
“Facility”! located in Baltimore County, Maryland. The Facility employed the Respondent
from on or about October 2, 2000 to September 29, 2020.

On March 30, 2021, Panel A, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2)
(2014 Repl. Vol. & 2020 Supp.) and Md. Code Regs. (““COMAR”) 10.32.02.08B(7), issued an
Order for Summary Suspension, in which it summarily suspended the Respondent’s license to
practice nuclear medicine technology, concluding that the public health, safety or welfare
imperatively required emergency action. The Respondent’s nuclear medicine technology license
remains suspended as of the date of these charges.

The Board initiated an investigation of the Respondent after reviewing a Mandated 10-
Day Report from the Facility, dated September 23, 2020, which stated that it suspended the
Respondent’s employment on September 17, 2020 “pending investigation due to unethical and
unprofessional behavior.” The Facility sent the Board a follow-up Mandated 10-Day Report,
dated October 2, 2020, which stated that it separated the Respondent from employment on

September 29, 2020, due to “unethical and unprofessional conduct.”

' Mr. Muller’s license was set to expire on April 30, 2021. Mr. Muller’s license did not expire because of
his non-renewal, however. A license may not lapse by operation of law “while the individual is under
investigation or while charges are pending.” Health Occ. § 14-5B-13; see also Salerian v. Board of
Physicians, 176 Md. App. 231, 247 (2007). Because the charges against Mr. Muller were still “pending”
as that term is used in the statute in April 2021, his license did not lapse or expire and remained active for
disciplinary purposes throughout the Board’s charging and administrative proceedings.
