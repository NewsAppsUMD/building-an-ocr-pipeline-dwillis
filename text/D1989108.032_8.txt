S believed they were adequate. As a result of Dr. Dabela’s refusal to complete all of the
questionnaires, Dr. S was not able to assess Dr. Dabela’s functioning in activities of daily living,
which meant he was unable to assess whether Dr. Dabela hd While
Dr. S acknowledged that there is no definitive algorithm to evaluate a physician’s a. Dr.
S used his clinical judgment and determined that Dr. Dabela was not competent to practice
medicine.

Dr. Dabela argues that the evaluation performed by Dr. A in February of 2020 should be
given more weight than the later evaluation conducted by Dr. S in December of 2020 because
Dr. A was the only physician who knew Dr. Dabela’s premorbid baseline history. Dr. Dabela
also argues that the ALJ only considered the mini mental examination conducted by Dr. A and
not the comprehensive neurological examination he conducted in determining that the summary
suspension was proper.

The Panel owes no deference to the non-demeanor-based credibility findings of the ALJ
and makes “its own decisions about bias, interest, credentials of expert witnesses, the logic and
persuasiveness of their testimony, and the weight to be given their opinions.” See State Bd. of
Physicians v. Bernstein, 167 Md. App. 714, 761 (2006). The Panel has reviewed and considered
the entire record in this case, which includes Dr. A’s full records concerning Dr. Dabela. Just as
the Panel considered Dr. R’s mini mental screening evaluation but focused on Dr. S and Dr. M’s
testimony as the basis for determining his competence, similarly here, the Panel considered Dr.
A’s evaluation, but does not give significant weight to this screening assessment. Dr. A is trained
as a neurologist, like Dr. R, while Dr. M and Dr. S are trained neuropsychologists. As Dr. S
explained, neurologists are not trained to conduct the more comprehensive neuropsychological

examination. The Panel, therefore, gives more weight to the testimony and reports of Dr. S and
