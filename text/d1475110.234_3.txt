agreeing not to practice pain management and to not prescribe benzodiazepines or opiates in
non-emergency situations, and, in an emergency, to prescribe for no more than three days.

In December 2013, however, while under the terms of the Consent Order, Dr. Folkemer
started working at a pain management medical practice and immediately prescribed opiates and
benzodiazepines. Dr. Folkemer has explained to the Board that he violated the Consent Order
due to the “tremendous financial pressure that he was under,” which he attributes to the Consent
Order. While Disciplinary Panel A is sympathetic to the hardships caused by financial distress,
the panel does not accept that it justifies violating the Consent Order. Dr. Folkemer’s violation
directly concerns his conduct that resulted in the Consent Order. With such a flagrant violation,
Dr. Folkemer has demonstrated that he lacks the judgment necessary for a license to practice
medicine in the State.

Based upon Dr. Folkemer’s violation of the Consent Order and pursuant to the terms of
the Consent Order, it is, by Disciplinary Panel A, hereby

ORDERED that C. Thomas Folkemer, M.D.’s license to practice medicine in Maryland
is PERMANENTLY REVOKED; and it is further

ORDERED that this is a public document.
