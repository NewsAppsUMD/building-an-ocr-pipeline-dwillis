Re: Surrender of License to Practice Medicine
Michael J. Quon, M.D. License Number: D40253
Case Number: 2218-0298A

Dear Dr. Bhandari and Members of Disciplinary Panel A,

Please be advised that, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. (“Health
Occ.”) §14-403 (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2018 Supp.), I have decided to SURRENDER
my license to practice medicine in the State of Maryland, License Number
D40253, effective immediately. I understand that upon the surrender of my
license, I may not give medical advice or treatment to any individual, with or
without compensation, and cannot prescribe medications or otherwise engage in
the practice of medicine in the State of Maryland as it is defined in the Maryland
Medical Practice Act (the “Act”), Health Occ. §§ 14-101 ef seg. and other
applicable laws. In other words, as of the effective date of this Letter of Surrender,
I understand that the surrender of my license means that I am in the same position
as an unlicensed individual in the State of Maryland.

I understand that this Letter of Surrender is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT, and
upon Disciplinary Panel A’s (“Panel A”) acceptance, becomes a FINAL ORDER
of Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”’).

I acknowledge that the Board initiated an investigation of my practice, and
on March 26, 2019, Panel A issued an Order for Summary Suspension of my
license. Panel A took such action pursuant to its authority under Md. Code Ann.,
State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2) (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2018 Supp.) concluding that the
public health, safety or welfare imperatively required emergency action. A copy of
the Order for Summary Suspension is attached as Attachment 1.

In addition, on March 27, 2019, Panel A issued disciplinary charges against
me under Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii) & (8) (2014 Repl. Vol.
