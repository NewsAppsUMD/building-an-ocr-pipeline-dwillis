Maryland appellate courts have held that the term “moral turpitude” is more broadly defined with
respect to Board licensure and discipline than in a witness impeachment context. See Ricketts v.
State, 291 Md. 701, 711-12 (1981) (“[W]hat constitutes a crime of moral turpitude may involve
different considerations compelling different results in different circumstances.”). In the context
of licensure and discipline, the term moral turpitude “strikes the broader chord of public
confidence in the administration of government. That is, a person who has credibility to testify
[at trial] may not have the public’s confidence to practice certain professions[.]” Stidwell v.
Maryland State Bd. of Chiropractic Exam’rs, 144 Md. App. 613, 619 (2002). Thus, it is well
established that “in the context of a licensing board’s review of the conduct of its licensee, the
concept of moral turpitude is rather broad.” Oltman, 162 Md. App. at 483. In the licensure
context, “[t]he term ‘moral turpitude’ has been defined generally as importing ‘an act of
baseness, vileness or depravity in the private and social duties which a man owes to his fellow:
men, or to society in general, contrary to the accepted and customary rule of right and duty
between man and man,’” Walman, 280 Md. at 459 (quoting Braverman y, Bar Ass'n of Balt.
City, 209 Md. 328, 344, cert. denied, 352 U.S. 830 (1956)).

The Court of Appeals has also established that “[a] guilty plea is an admission of conduct
that constitutes all the elements of a formal criminal charge” and that [bly entering a plea of
guilty, the accused is not simply stating that he did the discrete acts described in the indictment;
he is admitting guilt of a substantive crime.” Metheny y. State, 359 Md. 576, 599 (2000)
(internal citations and quotation marks omitted). A guilty plea “also serves as a stipulation that
no proof by the prosecution need [be] advanced. . . . It supplies both evidence and verdict, [thus]

ending [the] controversy.” Id.
