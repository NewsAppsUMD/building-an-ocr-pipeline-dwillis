Re: Darrell Lewis, M.D.
Case No.: 2223-0069
License No.: D76104

Dear Dr. Lewis and Counsel:

On April 11, 2023, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued
an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE in
this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2) (2022 Repl. Vol.). Dr. Lewis
was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing on May 24, 2023, before
Disciplinary Panel B, to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. On May 17,
2023, prior to the scheduled hearing Dr. Lewis’s counsel contacted the Board and stated that Dr.
Lewis waived his right to the post-deprivation hearing. Due to the waiver, Panel B did not hold a
post-deprivation hearing in this matter, the summary suspension continues, and the parties may
proceed to the summary suspension appeal if Dr. Lewis requests an ‘evidentiary hearing as
referenced below. COMAR 10.32.02.08E.

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board’s regulations, Dr. Lewis has the right to request a full evidentiary hearing
before an Administrative Law Judge. This request will be granted if the Board receives a written
request for a hearing within TEN (10) days of the date of this letter. Any-request for a hearing
