records indicate that May 23, 2013 was the first visit that Patient 7 saw Dr. Williams. Dr.
Williams also points out that the Largo office location was not open as of the date when the
examination was alleged to have taken place.

Patient 7’s inconsistent statements were not able to be reconciled at the OAH hearing.
Further, the ALJ was not able to make any demeanor based credibility findings with respect to
Patient 7 because Patient 7 did not testify. While the transcript of her interview was properly
admitted, after considering the significant inconsistencies in Patient 7’s story, the lack of
testimony to harmonize the inconsistencies, the character witnesses who described her as
dishonest and drug-seeking, and the inability for the ALJ to make any demeanor based
credibility findings with respect to Patient 7, the Panel finds that there is insufficient evidence to
support a violation as to Patient 7. Dr. Williams’s exception with respect to Patient 7 is granted.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The Panel concludes that Dr. Williams is guilty of immoral and unprofessional conduct in
the practice of medicine, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3), due to his violations of the
Board’s sexual misconduct regulations, COMAR 10.32.17, for Patients 2, 3, 5, and 6, willfully
making or filing a false report in the practice of medicine, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-
404(a)(11), and willfully making a false representation when seeking or making application for
licensure or any other application related to the practice of medicine, in violation of Health Occ.
§ 14-404(a)(36). The Panel does not find a violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3) with respect
to Patients 1, 4, and 7.

SANCTION

Dr. Williams takes exception to the ALJ’s proposed sanction of a permanent revocation

and argues that a period of suspension followed by a period of probation would be a more

equitable sanction. The Panel found that Dr. Williams committed a sexual violation against four
