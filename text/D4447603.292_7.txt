time and that she also smelled alcohol on him. The office manager further stated that
there was an incident last year in which someone found the Respondent looking unwell in
the Facility’s lobby and brought him to the Facility’s office. The office manager stated
that the Respondent did not appear well and could not stand or walk without assistance so
she asked a medical assistant to call an ambulance that then transported the Respondent
to a nearby hospital. In addition, the office manager stated that she received reports that
the Respondent had loss of bodily control on three separate occasions while in the office.
Interview of the Respondent

20. Board staff conducted an under-oath interview of the Respondent on March
18, 2022. In this interview, the Respondent reported that he has had an alcohol problem
since approximately 2001, and continues to drink at this time. He stated that he
currently drinks either wine or one half-pint of rum a couple nights per week. However,
the Respondent stated that when working at the Facility, he was drinking closer to a pint
of rum every night. The Respondent also stated that he will sometimes drink until 1:00
a.m. when he has to work the next day.

21. The Respondent acknowledged that he lost bodily control on one occasion
at work while treating a patient. In addition, the Respondent acknowledged that a few
years ago, he was hospitalized for malnutrition after he was found in the Facility’s lobby

appearing unwell and unable to walk.
