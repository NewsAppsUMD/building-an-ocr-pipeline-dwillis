 

In addition to the prior record (COMAR 10.32.02.09(B)(6)(a)), there are other
aggravating factors that should impact the determination of a sanction and fine for these charges.
First, the conduct was either committed intentionally, or with gross recklessness. I find the
Respondent made the statements with a lewd intent. If the Board finds that the Respondent did
not have such intent, but misspoke when he made the statements, then he heedlessly spoke to two
separate patients about the size and shape of their breasts, in a manner that could lead to such
misstatements and harm, rather than employing the use of either an in-person, video or
telephonic interpreter. Such behavior is likewise reckless. COMAR 10,32.02.09(B)(6)(b).
Secondly, the Respondent’s behavior caused harm to his patients and to the public. M.P.D. and
M.S.A.O. both experienced lasting feelings of discomfort, embarrassment and shame as a result
of the Respondent’s actions. The Respondent had to be removed from the roster of available
physicians for the fH program as a result of his actions, which caused harm to the
community. COMAR 10.32.02.09(B)(6)(c). Thirdly, the Respondent’s behavior targeted
particularly vulnerable patients. The two victims were non-English speaking patients who-were
enrolled in a program for individuals requiring free medical care. Additionally, both patients
were of advanced age. “All of these factors make them particularly vulnerable and susceptible of
abuse by those in a The Respondent had power for many reasons, but most specifically
because the victims needed the services he was providing, and lacked the ability to easily ,
advocate for themselves due to language barriers. COMAR 10.32.02.09(B)(6)(g).

Tn light of my findings, I recommend that the grounds for the Board’s proposed penalty

of a Reprimand has been supported.
