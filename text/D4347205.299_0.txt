Re: Surrender of License to Practice Medicine
Peter P. Chiang, M.D. License Number: D43472
Case Number: 7719-0057A

Dear Dr. Bhandari and Members of the Disciplinary Panel A,

Please be advised that, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. (“Health Occ.”)
§14-403 (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2017 Supp.), I have decided to SURRENDER my license to
practice medicine in the State of Maryland, License Number D43472, effective June 1,
2019. I understand that upon surrender of my license, I may not give medical advice or
treatment to any individual, with or without compensation, and cannot prescribe
medications or otherwise engage in the practice of medicine in the State of Maryland as it
is defined in the Maryland Medical Practice Act (the “Act”), Health Occ. §§ 14-101 ef
seq, and other applicable laws. In other words, as of the effective date of this Letter of
Surrender, I understand that the surrender of my license means that I am in the same
position as an unlicensed individual in the State of Maryland.

I understand that this Letter of Surrender is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT, and upon
Disciplinary Panel A’s (“Panel A”) acceptance, becomes a FINAL ORDER of Panel A
of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”).

I acknowledge that on July 19, 2018, Panel A issued disciplinary charges against
me under Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(22) and (40). Specifically, Panel A alleged that I had
failed to meet the standards of quality medical care and keep adequate medical records
for multiple patients. I resolved these disciplinary charges through entering into a
Consent Order with Panel A, dated January 4, 2019 (“Consent Order”), in which Panel A
found that I violated Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(22) (fails to meet appropriate standards for
quality medical care) and (40) (fails to keep adequate medical records). Pursuant to the
terms of the Consent Order, I was reprimanded and placed on probation for a minimum
of two (2) years with certain terms and conditions including that I permanently cease
prescribing and dispensing all Controlled Dangerous Substances, with the exception of
buprenorphine, and that I complete a panel-approved course in medical documentation
within six (6) months of the Consent Order. A copy of the Consent Order is attached and
incorporated herein as Attachment 1,
