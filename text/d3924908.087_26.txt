The Respondent’s records contain a billing form for services for Patient 7 for services on
April 24, 2014. (St. Ex. 28, at 517.) The billing form delineates $250 under CPT code 99245,
$2640 for a SPT of 264 allergens, and $100 for a SP for a total of $2990. Patient 7’s first visit to
the Respondent, however, was on July 18, 2014. There are no notes to show that a visit on April
24, 2014, occurred, and the Respondent’s summary does not mention a visit for that date. The
Respondent’s exceptions state, “The record does not support finding Respondent billed Patient 7
for 4/24/14 visit.” The Respondent cites his own testimony in which he stated that the bill form
contains the date, “7/18/14” after “on file,” which pertains to patient’s authorization to release
medical records necessary to process the claim. July 18, 2014, was the date of the patient’s
initial visit with the Respondent. He testified that the billing form was not submitted for billing,
explaining that “the insurance company would not even look at it because of the discrepancy.” It
should be noted that an inconsistency between the date of the patient’s authorization for release
of records for processing and the dates of service is not present on the other billing forms with
false dates of service, such as March 24, 2014, for Patient 1 or April 15, 2014, for Patient 6. It is
possible that the Respondent recognized the discrepancy in the April 24, 2014, billing form prior
to submitting it and decided not to submit this false document. The Panel will accept the
Respondent’s assertion that he did not bill for treatment or services for Patient 7 on April 24,
2014.4 But it must also be noted that this billing form has the Respondent’s signature on it with
the signature date of April 24, 2014. (St. Ex. 28 at 517.)

In sum, the Panel concludes that the Respondent did bill for medical services he did not

perform for Patients 1 and 6, as described above. The billing forms at issue for Patients 1 and 6

* Likewise, concerning Patient 2, the Panel does not find that the Respondent submitted to the
insurance company billing forms for services on March 31, 2014, and June 6, 2014, as neither of
these forms was signed by the Respondent.
