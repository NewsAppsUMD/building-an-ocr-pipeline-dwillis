Respondent testified that he did recall that: “I called her that once because her hair was red.” Asked
whether the person whom he called Strawberry was Individual 4, the Respondent said he did not
remember.

About an hour after the interview, the Respondent’s counsel emailed a Board investigator
and said that the Respondent recalled “additional important information concerning [Individual
4}.” Thus, four days later, the Respondent was interviewed a second time.

At the second interview, the Respondent testified,

[Individual 4], I, 1 would bring coffee to [Individual 4]. I
didn’t know what kind of coffee she liked, you know, and people are
very particular about their coffee, so [Individual 4] would tell me
what coffee she wanted. This isn’t something where I’m forcing
coffee on someone.

And that sort of sparked a friendly relationship at the hospital
and that friendly relationship morphed into a romantic relationship
outside of the hospital.

And on one occasion she drove to my administrative office,
which is about a mile or so away from the hospital, after hours,
specifically to have an encounter with me. She drove her own car,
you know, I wasn’t there with her.

And, and that lasted a very short time, but the reason that it
ended was strictly on — I ended it. And the reason it ended was
because she made a demand for money to me and that, you know,
freaked me out. I was extremely concerned, obviously, because
there was no talk of that at all.

And obviously it is an implied threat to me, and so, and so
that’s how that ended.

The Respondent was then asked whether he knew who Individual 4 was at the first
interview. The Respondent testified:
A. No, not, no, I didn’t. It took me a while to sort of put two
and two together.
At the very end when we were talking about strawberry, it,

it hit like that, because I didn’t call her by her name.
Q. Oh, okay.
