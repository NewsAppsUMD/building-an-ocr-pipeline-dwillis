of removal of granulation tissue, but did not send that tissue to the pathology lab. The Board
alleged the Respondent further failed to note his use of the non-absorbable Ethibond sutures in
charts of all but one of the suture patients. Finally, the Board alleged the Respondent engaged in
unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine by conducting prospective human subject
research on the suture patients without obtaining IRB approval. I find the Respondent’s treatment .

29 AN information regarding anesthesia type is taken from the Patients’ Anesthesia Interoperative Record (AIR). The
corresponding operative reports for all suture Patients not consistent with the AIR. The operative reports list the
anesthesia used as Laryngeal Mask Anesthesia (LMA). The ATR and operative report for Patient 2 are consistent in
reporting the use of General Anesthesia. ,

30 Dr, Mesrobian testified he was unaware of why IV was checked on the AIR and implied it was a mistake. He
opined based on the records that Patient 5 was not placed under general anesthesia. Tr. vol. 4, at 486.

3) Like with Patient 5, Dr. Mesrobian did not know why MASK was checked on the AIR or what it meant. But he
opined, based on Patient 9°s records, that she was not placed under general anesthesia. Id, at 490.
