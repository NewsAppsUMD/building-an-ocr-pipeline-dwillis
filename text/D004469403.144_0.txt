ORDER ON APPLICATION FOR REINSTATEMENT
OF MEDICAL LICENSE AFTER REVOCATION

I. INTRODUCTION

On January 23, 2018, Disciplinary Panel B (the “Panel” or “Panel B”) of the Maryland
State Board of Physicians (the “Board”) issued an Order After Show Cause Hearing revoking the
Maryland medical license of Andrea N. Bailey, M.D. The revocation was based on the Panel’s
findings that Dr. Bailey violated multiple provisions of a 2016 Consent Order she entered into
with the Panel that required her to comply with conditions of a Rehabilitation Agreement with
the Maryland Professional Rehabilitation Program (“MPRP”). On October 26, 2022, the Board
received Dr. Bailey’s application for the reinstatement of her license.

On October 25, 2023, Panel B, acting as a Reinstatement Inquiry Panel, met with Dr.
Bailey and an Administrative Prosecutor from the State to consider her reinstatement application.
Panel B reviewed relevant written materials including Dr. Bailey’s application and attachments;
criminal court documents from Virginia; answers to the Board’s reinstatement questions received
from Dr. Bailey on June 15, 2023; medical records and reports from health providers; letters of
support and recommendation; a memorandum from the State recommending the denial of Dr.
Bailey’s reinstatement; Dr. Bailey’s reply to the State dated September 8, 2023; and her prior

disciplinary Orders. The Panel also heard oral presentations from Dr. Bailey and the State.
