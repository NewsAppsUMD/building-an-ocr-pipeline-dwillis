not rely upon this letter as evidence that Dr. Hardi’s treatment of Individual A overlapped with
their sexual relationship. Individual A’s testimony and the medical records demonstrate that the
patient relationship and sexual relationship overlapped. In sum, Dr. Hardi is guilty of immoral
and unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-
404(a)(3)(i) and (ii), and engaged in sexual misconduct, in violation of Health Occ. § 1-212 and

Panel B does not adopt the ALJ’s reasoning for rejecting Individual B’s testimony. To be
clear, Panel B does not consider the following factors to be probative of Dr. Hardi’s claim that he
did not sexually assault Individual B: (1) that Individual B failed to promptly report the alleged
sexual assault to her employer, (2) that Individual B told to a co-worker that Dr. Hardi “came on
to me” rather than using the terms attempted rape or sexual assault, and (3) that Individual B did
not appear distressed to her co-worker the morning after the alleged sexual assault. Panel B
nevertheless agrees with the ALJ that there is insufficient evidence of sexual assault or to
otherwise find a violation pertaining to Individual B.

and did not identify any inappropriate conduct. In her letter, the medical student stated that
Individual C opened and pulled down her own pants and that the patient was covered in a drape.

The medical: student stated that Dr. Hardi informed the patient regarding what he was doing at
