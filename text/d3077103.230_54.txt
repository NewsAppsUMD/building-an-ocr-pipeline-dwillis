PROPOSED CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Based on the Proposed Findings of Fact and Discussion, I conclude as a matter of law /
that the Respondent engaged in immoral conduct in the practice of medicine by engaging in a
consensual sexual relationship with a patient, Individual A. Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 14~
404(a)(3)G) (2014 & Supp. 2019).

I further conclude as a matter of law that the Respondent engaged in unprofessional conduct
in the practice of medicine by engaging in a consensual sexual relationship with a patient. Md.
Code Ann., Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii) (2014).

I further conclude as ‘a matter of law that the Respondent engaged in sexual misconduct in
the practice of medicine by engaging in a consensual sexual relationship with a patient he was
treating. Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 1-212; COMAR 10.32.17.02B(3)(a) and (b); COMAR
10.32.17.03A. .

404(a)(3)(i), (ii) of the Health Occupations Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland (2014 &
Supp. 2019); COMAR 10,32.17.02B(3)(a) and (b); COMAR 10.32.17.03A pertaining to Individuals
B, C, D, and E.

T further conclude as a mantter of law that a one year suspension of the Respondent’s medical
license, retroactive to March 5, 2019, the date the Respondent was summarily suspended, is
reasonably calculated to protect the public. Attorney Grievance Comm'n of Md, v. Harris, 371 Md.
» $10 (2002); Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 14-404(a) (Supp. 2019).
