and assessment.” Further, Dr. Halstead did not use standard terminology or methodology, did
not systematically follow up on significant findings or use a methodological approach to
ascertain a diagnostic conclusion. His approach to treatment planning was haphazard, The
report found failures related to medical histories, physical examinations, differential diagnoses,
medical testing, treatment or care plans, and progress notes. Physician A reiterated that Dr.
Halstead should complete an internal medicine review course, an electronic medical records
optimization course, a recordkeeping course, and he should obtain a subscription to an online
decisional support system. The report also repeated the six clinical recommendations from
previous reports that continued to be deficient.

Physician A and Dr. Halstead met face-to-face in October and November 2018. The
Board did not receive any quarterly reports after the third report because Dr. Halstead failed to
make his payments to Company A.

SHOW CAUSE HEARING

On January 28, 2019, Panel B issued an Amended Violation of Consent Order and Notice
to Show Cause and, on March 27, 2019, held a Show Cause hearing at which Dr. Halstead
appeared. At the hearing, the State argued that Dr. Halstead’s practice had significant patient
care deficiencies and recommended enrollment in an extensive and thorough physician
assessment and education program.

Dr. Halstead agreed that he had some deficiencies in his practice at the time the reports
were created, but argued that his practice had improved since the reports were issued and
characterized some of the reports’ conclusions as extreme or overzealous. Dr, Halstead

recommended that the Panel approve a new supervisor and suggested further coursework.
