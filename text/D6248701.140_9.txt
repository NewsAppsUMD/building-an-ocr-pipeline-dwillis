the time.” He admitted, however, that “by the fourth session, in a mis-guided attempt to
build trust, [the Respondent] did engage in what he acknowledges was inappropriate
contact with the patient. While they did not engage in sexual intercourse, they did
remove most of their clothes. As soon as [the Respondent] realized what he had been led
into, he ended the session and did not see the patient again, nor respond to her attempts to
contact him” (but see 4 14 and 21-22, supra.).
G. Interview of the Respondent

28. As part of its investigation, Board staff interviewed the Respondent under
oath on or about November 25, 2019. The Respondent’s attorney was present.

29. During the interview, the following exchange occurred when Board staff
asked the Respondent about his relationship with the Patient:

[Board Staff]: Can you just describe in detail the nature of
your relationship with her?

[The Respondent]: I can’t. I don’t remember.
[Board Staff]: What don’t you remember? .. .

[The Respondent]: Anything.

[Board Staff]: So you don’t remember treating her as a
patient?
[The Respondent]: Not to the level of certainty . . . that would

allow me to say it’s a fact.

[Board Staff]: So these notes . . . that you provided to the
Board in writing, were those notes that you
recalled or are those contemporaneous notes
from when you were treating her?

[The Respondent]: Not sure. I think they’re contemporaneous, but
my memory is wiped.
