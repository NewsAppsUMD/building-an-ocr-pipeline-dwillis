Ii. Revocation of the Respondent’s Controlled Dangerous Substance
Registration

On August 19, 2019, the Office of Controlled Substances Administration (“OCSA”)
issued to the Respondent a “Notice of Intent lo Revoke Controlled Dangerous
Substance Registration (the “Notice of Intent to Revoke”), Case # MDH-OCSA 38-
19-26032.""

OCSA’s Notice of Intent to Revoke was based on the Respondent’s 2018 Consent
Order.

On January 15, 2020, an administrative hearing at the Maryland Office of
Administrative Hearings (“OAH”) was convened to provide the Respondent the
opportunity to show cause why OCSA’s contemplated enforcement action should
not be instituted.

On June 25, 2020, after reviewing the exceptions to the OAH Proposed Decision
and arguments of the parties, the Designee to the Secretary of the Maryland
Department of Health issued the Final Decision and Order (“OSCA Final Order’).

The OCSA Final Order adopted and affirmed in full the OAH Proposed Decision
including, but not limited to, the following findings:

a. the Respondent violated Crim. Law § 5-902(c)(2), which requires that CDS

be prescribed only in instances that conform to the standards of the Respondent’s
profession;

b. the Respondent continued to violate the standard of quality care during the
probationary period imposed in the 2018 Consent Order. Specifically, the

4 OCSA enforces the Controlled Dangerous Substance Act, Md, Code Ann., Criminal Law (“Crim. Law”)
§ 5-100 ef seg. and issues permits to practitioners to dispense and distribute CDS.

SCivil or criminal penalties may be imposed under Section 5-902(e) “is in addition to, and not instead of,
any other civil or administrative penalty or sanction authorized by law.” Crim. Law § 5-907.
