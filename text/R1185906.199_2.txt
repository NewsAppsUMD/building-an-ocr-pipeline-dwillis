On January 24, 2019, the ALJ issued a Proposed Default Order, The ALJ found that Mr. —
Townes had proper notice of the January 22, 2019 prehearing conference and that he failed to
attend or participate in the prehearing conference without good cause. The ALJ proposed that
the Panel find Mr. Townes in default, adopt as fact the statements set out in the allegations of
fact section of the charges, conclude as a matter of law that Mr. Townes violated Health Occ. §
14-5B-14(a)(3) and (26) in the manner set forth in the charges, and impose any disciplinary
sanction that the Panel deemed appropriate.

The Proposed Default Order notified the parties that they may file written exceptions to
the proposed order but must do so within 15 days of the date of the Proposed Default Order. The
Proposed Default Order stated that any exceptions and request for a hearing must be sent to the
Board with attention to the Board’s Executive Director. Neither party filed exceptions. On
February 11, 2019, the State submitted a Recommendation for Sanction in Lieu of Exceptions,
which, recommended that the Panel revoke Mr. Townes’s license to practice radiography based
on his consistent lack of compliance and manifest lack of interest in responding to the
disciplinary charges against him.

Thereafter, the case was forwarded to Board Disciplinary Panel B. (“Panel B”) for final
disposition.

FINDINGS OF FACT

Because Panel B concludes that Mr. Townes has defaulted, the following findings of fact
are adopted from the allegations of fact set forth in the September 26, 2018 Charges Under the
Maryland Radiation Therapy, Radiography, Nuclear Medicine Technology, and Radiology

Assistance Act and are deemed proven by the preponderance of the evidence.
