EXCEPTIONS

Dr. Epstein’s remaining exceptions and oral exceptions fall into four categories, Dr.
Epstein argues that: (1) his exceptions should not have been stricken; (2) his prescribing to
family members was not unethical and therefore, was not unprofessional, (3) his prescribing was
permissible because he was treating patients in emergency circumstances, and (4) the ALJ erred
by rejecting his expert’s witness’s conclusions,

1, Exception regarding Motion to Strike

At the exceptions hearing, Dr. Epstein argued that he was not afforded the opportunity to
defend his actions at the evidentiary hearing because the administrative prosecutor did not
question him about those actions. As an initial matter, Dr. Epstein did not file a written response
to the State’s Motion to Strike and, therefore, has waived any arguments concerning the stricken
exceptions. However, even had Dr, Epstein not waived this issue, his arguments have no merit.
Dr. Epstein briefly testified and, therefore, had the opportunity to explain his actions, He chose
not to testify on those matters at the hearing. He cannot later, months after the evidentiary
hearing, add additional testimony that he could have presented at the evidentiary hearing. Panel
A rejects his exceptions on this issue.

2. Dr. Epstein’s Prescribing to Family Members

In his exceptions, Dr. Epstein challenged the ALJ’s finding that prescribing to family
members constitutes unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine. Dr. Epstein argues that,
because the laws and statutes do not expressly prohibit prescribing to a family member, no
violation occurred. The State contends that the Board has consistently interpreted unprofessional

conduct in the practice or medicine to include prescribing CDS and providing other medical

treatment for family members.
