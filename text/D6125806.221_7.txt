Another of Patient 1’s inconsistencies, according to the ALI, was Dr. Singhal’s
discussion with Patient 1 about Patient 1’s sex with his wife. During the Board investigation,
Patient 1 claimed that Dr. Singhal asked about whether he could “finish” during sex because it
was a possible side effect of the medication. Patient 1 told Board staff that Dr. Singhal asked
him about sexual positions and frequency of sex. In his testimony before the ALJ, Patient 1
testified that he brought up his inability to finish during sex and that he asked Dr. Singhal about
whether it was a side effect of the medication he was taking. In both instances, Patient | thought
that Dr. Singhal’s questions were inappropriate and odd. Panel A finds that the inconsistency
about who initiated the conversation about sex is relatively minor and are not indicative of
Patient 1’s dishonesty.

The ALJ found that this purported inconsistency demonstrated Patient 1’s lack of
credibility, but did not point out that Dr. Singhal himself testified inconsistently on the same
topic. In his interview with the Board, Dr. Singhal stated that they “did not have any discussion
[about sexual matters].” During testimony before the ALJ, Dr. Singhal stated that he discussed
sexual side effects of the medication with Patient 1.

Based on the cold record, the Panel finds Patient 1 more credible than Dr. Singhal. The
Board finds that Dr. Singhal brought up the sexual positions, which was gratuitous.
Additionally, the Board finds that his knowledge of the sex life of Patient 1 and his wife gave
him intimate knowledge that he could use in his pursuit of Patient 1’s wife.

Ultimately, the Panel finds that it is not important whether Dr. Singhal or Patient 1
initiated the conversation, what is important is that Dr. Singhal probed Patient 1 about his sex life
with his wife and knew and potentially used that information before Dr. Singhal initiated a

sexual relationship with Patient 1’s wife.
