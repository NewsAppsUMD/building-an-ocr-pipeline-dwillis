CHRC.” Board staff further informed the Respondent that he had ten business days to
submit the CHRC.
5. On or about November 13, 2017, the Respondent replied by email to Board
staff's November 1, 2017 email, stating that he had submitted a CHRC for the California
Medical Board and it had been approved, and requested the return of his renewal fee
and that his Maryland medical license be placed on “inactive” status.
6. By email dated November 20, 2017, Board staff again provided the Respondent
with the following information:
Results of a CHRC in another state or conducted elsewhere in Maryland
cannot be sent to the Board. Each entity/agency/employer has a unique
authorization code from CJIS and the FBI. The responses are sent
directly to the appropriate agency. CHRCs cannot be shared between
entities/agencies/employers.
Board staff attached instructions on how to complete a CHRC.
7. By email dated November 20, 2017, the Respondent reiterated that he had
answered affirmatively to Question 29d. on his Maryland renewal application regarding
his CHRC because he had submitted a CHRC to the California Medical Board. He
again requested that the Board refund his application fee, and that his license be placed
on inactive status.
8. To date, the Respondent has not submitted a CHRC to the Maryland Board.
9. Panel A’s investigation determined that the Respondent failed to submit his
fingerprints to CJIS in compliance with the CHRC process, as set forth in Health Occ. II

§ 14-308.1.
