refusal to change her medicine during the normal course of their friendship, but agreed to deny
that she had done so out of the same close friendship.

I am not persuaded by the Respondent’s theory. As mentioned above, I found Patient 2
to have been a credible witriess. She acknowledged a friendship with Person 1 and Patient 1,
which grew closer overtime. She also acknowledged that she told them that the Respondent was
her psychiatrist, However, Patient 2 insisted that she i is a“vety private person” and has never
discussed her diagnosis or treatment with anyone, I believe her, and I give determinative weight
on this issue to her testimony. Accordingly, I find that the Respondent discussed confidential

. information about Patient 2 with Person 1. I specifically find that the Respondent talked about
Patient 2’s diagnosis.and that she frequently asked him to change her medication. I also find that
the Respondent talked to Patient 1 about al.

However, I am not persuaded by Person Ps testimony that the Respondent disclosed
information about Patient 1’s mental condition to her. As discussed above, Person | is not
sufficiently credible to find something as a fact based on her testimony alone. Patient 1’s
statements to the Board about what the Respondent told Person 1 about heri is not directly
corroborated by Person P s testimony. Based on this, ] am not persuaded that the Respondent
told Person 1 that Patient 1 was really sick and crazy, had a “split personality” or depressional
[sic] problem,” or was “a wreck trapped jnside of a cage that’s radical, angry. ‘If she got out, she
would, she would destroy, she would kill.”

Legal analysis .

“Neither party’s closing argument cited to any statutory or case law, Section 14-404
authorizes the Board to discipline a physician who “is guilty of [u]nprofessional conduct in the
practice of medicine.” Neither the statute nor.any enabling regulation defities “unprofessional

conduct in the practice of medicine.”
