including cocaine and fentanyl;

life as well while not a work”;

 

¢ The Respondent “would come into work and she would visibly be under the

 

influence”;

e In June, 2021, there was a “drastic change” in the Respondent’s behavior, in
that “she would come to work and she would just be sweating...she would
disappear. She would talk a lot to herself and then she would walk around
and just like be cursing, like the ‘B’ word, the ‘F’ word”;

e The Respondent “literally...would walk sideways, like her — like she
couldn’t even stand or like her balance was off, I mean, or she was just

stumbling”;
