A. Individuals licensed or certified under Health Occupations Article, Titles 14
and 15, Annotated Code of Maryland, may not engage in sexual misconduct.

B. Health Occupations Article, §§14-404(a)(3) and 15-314(3), Annotated Code

of Maryland, includes, but is not limited to, sexual misconduct. ‘

As the moving party, the State has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the
evidence. Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-217 (2014); Comm’r of Labor & Indus. v. Bethlehem
Steel Corp., 344 Md. 17, 34 (1996).

- After considering all of the evidence presented in light of the applicable legal authority, I
conclude that the State has met its burden of proof on all charges. It demonstrated that the
Respondent is subject to sanction under section 14-404(a)(3)(i) and (ii) of the Act, because he
was guilty of immoral and unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine. That immoral and
unprofessional conduct involved his engaging in “sexual impropriety” as defined by COMAR
10.32.17.02B(2)(a) and (b)(ii), and “sexual violation(s)” as defined by 10.32.17.02B(4)(a) and
(b)(v), both of which constitute “sexual misconduct,” as defined by COMAR 10.32.17.02B(3),
with regard to acts of sexualized touching that he committed while examining Patients 1 through

7. The State also demonstrated that the Respondent is subject to sanction under section 14-

404(a)(11) of the Act for willfully failing to disclose his termination from a.
his July 29, 2015 application for reappointment FO It further demonstrated

that the Respondent is subject to sanction under section 14-404(a)(36) of the Act for willfully
failing to disclose his termination ion... his August 10, 2015 physicians
renewal application. The evidence that the Respondent provided in his defense, including his
own testimony, does not refute or even mitigate the seriousness of the charges brought against

him by the Board.
