described the 3-day program that he attended a and the evaluators who assessed him. He
stated that they asked many questions about Patient B that he “was not expecting to discuss” at
the time, so his answers were “off the cuff” without- having the benefit of his patient records.

The Respondent testified that Patient B first became his patient in 1998 and remained a
patient until June 2005, when her medical condition resolved. “Following that, by mutual
agreement, we transferred from a previous doctor-patient relationship to a personal relationship,
which [was] initiated in mutual interest in art that was the catalyst, that made us interested in
each other...” (Transcript, p. 130.) ‘he Respondent claimed that he never saw Patient B again
as a patient after the medical records ended in June 2005. ‘The Respondent testified that he and
-Patient B began to “socialize” within “a month, or two or three” after June 2005. (Transcript, p.

The Respondent explained that Patient B came to see him as a referral from her primary
care physician for treatment of hypothyroidism. He denied prescribing medications or treating
Patient B for depression, although he did suggest to her that it could be related to her ongoing
complaints. The Respondent did send an initial report in 1998 to Patient B’s primary care
physician, but was unable to confirm if other reports were sent. The Respondent testified that on
the last visit in June 2005, Patient B expressed that she had no complaints and was completely
satisfied with her treatment. (Iranscript, p. 136.) When asked if he exploited Patient B with the
knowledge he had based on his treatment, the Respondent denicd it. The Respondent denied that
he needed to send Patient B a formal discharge letter because he was seeing her as a consultant

not a primary physician.
