JURISDICTION

 

3. This Accusation is brought before the Board, under the authority of the following
laws. All section references are to the Business and Professions Code unless otherwise indicated.
4. Section 2227 of the Code provides that a licensee who is found guilty under the
Medical Practice Act may have his or her license revoked, suspended for a period not to exceed
one year, placed on probation and required to pay the costs of probation monitoring, or such other
action taken in relation to discipline as the Board deems proper.
5. Section 2234 of the Code states:
“The board shall take action against any licensee who is charged with
unprofessional conduct. In addition to other provisions of this article,
unprofessional conduct includes, but is not limited to, the following:
“(a) Violating or attempting to violate, directly or indirectly, assisting in or
abetting the violation of, or conspiring to violate any provision of this
chapter.
“(b) Gross negligence. '
“(c) Repeated negligent acts. To be repeated, there must be two or more
negligent acts or omissions. An initial negligent act or omission followed by
a separate and distinct departure from the applicable standard of care shall
constitute repeated negligent acts.
“(1) An initial negligent diagnosis followed by an act or omission
medically appropriate for that negligent diagnosis of the patient shall
constitute a single negligent act.
(2) When the standard of care requires a change in the diagnosis,
act, or omission that constitutes the negligent act described in paragraph (1),
including, but not limited to, a reevaluation of the diagnosis or a change in
treatment, and the licensee’s conduct departs from the applicable standard of
care, each departure constitutes a separate and distinct breach of the standard

of care.
