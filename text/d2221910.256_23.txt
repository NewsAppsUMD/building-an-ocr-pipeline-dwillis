a description of any fetal abnormalities. In addition, there is no statement whether the
Respondent offered Patient A a pathologic evaluation of the abnormal fetus.

30. Under the heading Post Procedure/Discharge Orders, the medical record states
that Patient A was given “Percocet 5/325 #15 Rx” and “Pitocin IM 2 cc.” State 23. The record
does not state the date, time, or who administered the Pitocin; presumably it was administered on
March 1, 2014.

31. | The Respondent wrote in the medical record that his discharge diagnosis was:

“28 wk IUP,” Multiple Anomalies, Medical Abortion.” State 23. He also wrote that Patient A
was stable for discharge and had minimal bleeding. Patient A’s signature appears underneath, as
does the Respondent’s.

32. The medical record contains Patient A’s vital signs taken by the Respondent after
the procedure on March 1, 2014 at 9:15, 9:30, and 9:45 (presumably am, the record does not say)
and “No Complaints” is circled. Her vital signs were normal and she was experiencing light
bleeding and medium cramping. The Respondent noted Patient A would follow up with her
private physician. Patient A did not sign this form although there is a space for her to sign
agreeing that she is being discharged without complaint, has received post-operative medications
and instructions, has the clinic’s emergency number, and has had all her questions answered.
The Respondent did not note in the record whether Patient A was released to a responsible
individual because she had been given sedating medication (Nubain and midazolam).

33. Sometime shortly after 9:45 am on March 1, 2014, Patient A left the
Respondent’s office with her husband and returned to her hotel. She did not return to the

Respondent’s office for any follow up care.

3 Intrauterine pregnancy.
