Re: Bernard Cohen, M.D.
Case No.: 2222-0064B
License No.: D26518

Dear Dr. Cohen and Counsel:

On May 11, 2022, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued
an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE in
this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2). On May 25, 2022, Dr. Cohen
was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing before Disciplinary Panel B to show
cause why that suspension should not be continued. Dr. Cohen attended the hearing on that date
and was represented by counsel, M. Natalie McSherry, Esquire. The State was represented by
Robert J. Gilbert, Assistant Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor. Both parties presented
oral argument at the post-deprivation hearing.

After consideration of the parties’ presentations, Disciplinary Panel B determined, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the health, welfare, and safety of the public imperatively
required the disciplinary panel to summarily suspend Dr. Cohen’s license and that there exists a
substantial risk of serious harm to the public health, safety or welfare in Dr. Cohen’s continued
practice. Disciplinary Panel B thus will not terminate the summary suspension order at this time,
