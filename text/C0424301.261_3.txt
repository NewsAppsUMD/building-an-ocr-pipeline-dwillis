On November 13, 2020, Panel A sent Ms. Kwakye a Violation of Consent Order and Notice
of Show Cause Hearing based on this alleged violation by first class mail to her address of record.
The Notice was not returned as undeliverable. The Violation of Consent Order and Notice of
Show Cause Hearing notified Ms. Kwakye that a show cause hearing was scheduled for December
2, 2020. Prior to the hearing, Board staff sent Ms. Kwakye several emails notifying Ms. Kwakye
that the hearing would be conducted by the Zoom teleconference platform and inviting Ms.
Kwakye to participate in test calls. Board staff also sent Ms. Kwakye three emails with the Zoom
conference information for the hearing scheduled for December 2, 2020 at 1:00 pm. The emails
instructed Ms. Kwakye to sign in 10 to 15 minutes prior to the scheduled time of the hearing.
Board staff sent a final email on December 2, 2020 at 12:55 pm stating “please sign in now for
your scheduled hearing.” Ms, Kwakye did not participate in any of the test calls or respond to any
of the emails from Board staff.

On December 2, 2020, at 2:09 pm, Panel A commenced the show cause hearing. The
administrative prosecutor assigned to the case appeared and represented the State. Ms. Kwakye
did not attend the hearing, nor did counsel appear on her behalf. The Board received no request
for postponement or communications from Ms. Kwakye-on the day of the hearing or in the days
leading up to the hearing. The administrative prosecutor presented the case against Ms. Kwakye
regarding her violation of the January 29, 2019 Consent Order for failing to complete the required
ethics course. The State recommended that the Panel order the revocation of Ms. Kwakye’s license

to practice as a Physician Assistant in the State of Maryland.
