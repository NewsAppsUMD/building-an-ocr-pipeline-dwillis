CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact and discussion of the State’s and Dr. MacKoul’s
exceptions, as set forth above, the Panel concludes that Dr. MacKoul: is guilty of unprofessional
conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii); grossly
overutilized health care services, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(19); and failed to meet
appropriate standards as determined by appropriate peer review for the delivery of quality medical
and surgical care performed in an outpatient facility, office, hospital, or any other location in this
State, based on his care of Patients 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 9, in violation of § 14-404({a)(22). Dr. MacKoul
did not violate the standard of care with respect to his care of Patient 3, 8, or 10. The Panel does
not find that Dr. MacKoul failed to keep adequate medical records for any patient and the charge
of a failure to keep adequate medical records is dismissed.

prior to surgery, failed to review the patient’s chart for pre-surgical clearance, failed to adequately
communicate with the patient and her family the day of surgery about delays in the surgery, and
