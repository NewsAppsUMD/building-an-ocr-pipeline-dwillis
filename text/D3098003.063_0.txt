FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

 

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

Howard J. Hoffberg, M.D., was originally licensed to practice medicine in the State of
Maryland on June 25, 1984, under license number D30980. On May 20, 2021, in the United
States District Court for the District of Maryland, Dr. Hoffberg pled guilty to one count of
Conspiracy to Violate Anti-Kickback Statute, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.! On March 2,
2022, Dr. Hoffberg was sentenced to eight months in prison to commence on his reporting date
of April 18, 2022, followed by one year of supervised probation, and payment of a $55,000.00
fine.

On August 25, 2021, the Office of the Attorney General filed with the Maryland Board of
Physicians (the “Board”) a petition to suspend Dr. Hoffberg’s license to practice medicine (“the
Petition”) and a proposed show cause order pursuant to section 14-404(b)(1) of the Maryland
Medical Practice Act. On January 10, 2022, Board Disciplinary Panel B issued an Order

suspending the license of Dr. Hoffberg pursuant to Health Occ. § 14-404(b)(1).”

 

' The citation for the Anti-Kickback Statute is 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b.

? At the time the Petition was filed in this case, Dr. Hoffberg had not yet been sentenced. Accordingly, a Petition to
suspend Dr. Hoffberg’s license was filed pursuant to Health Occ. § 14-404(b)(1) instead of a petition to revoke
pursuant to Health Occ. § 14-404(b)(2), which is now warranted after the completion of sentencing,
