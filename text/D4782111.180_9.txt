power of the prisms to unreasonable and often intolerable levels.’ Patients
complained of headaches, double vision or visual discomfort;
c. The Respondent diagnosed children with amblyopia who did not meet that

diagnostic definition (Patients 1, 3, 7, and 10);

   

d. The Respondent’s prescription of daily atropine drops to treat children whom

he wrongly diagnosed with amblyopia is unnecessary and overly aggressive. In one

instance (Patient 1), the treatment caused amblyopia in the aligned eye (“reverse

amblyopia”).

€. The Respondent advised parents, without meuical substantiation, that using

prism glasses will help ameliorate non-specific complaints including “moodiness,”

neck stiffness and gastrointestinal distress (Patients 2, 3, 6, and 10);

f. The Respondent proposed to perform eye surgery on two patients (Patients |

and 2), both of whom were asymptomatic and did not require the prism glasses the

Respondent had ordered them to wear, much less surgery for an eye problem that

did not exist. Eye surgery for strabismus is based on prism measurements which

the Respondent failed to perform.

BASIS FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION
A child who wears prism glasses must force their eyes to overcome the

double image the prism induces. The use of prism glasses on a pediatric patient

who does not have strabismus has the potential of causing harm and long-term
° Adults would find it difficult to tolerate two prism diopters. The Respondent had prescribed prisms up to
15 prism diopters to his pediatric patients. Although a child’s brain is developing, if forced to wear
unnecessary prisms, the brain can adapt, but only to a point. Some of the patients wore prism glasses as

ordered by the Respondent until they could not tolerate the magnitude of image displacement, ultimately
refusing to wear the glasses.
