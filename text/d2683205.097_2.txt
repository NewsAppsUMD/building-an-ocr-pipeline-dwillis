Prescribes buprenorphine‘ with opioids and benzodiazepines which not
only places patients at risk for respiratory depression but is also counter-
intuitive since buprenorphine is prescribed to treat opiate dependency;

Fails to order regular toxicology screens for patients for whom he has
prescribed high doses of CDS;

Fails to address urine toxicology screening results that are inconsistent
with prescribed medications, which are suggestive that the patients are
either selling the prescribed CDS, or are taking unprescribed CDS;

Continues to prescribe opioids to patients after the urine toxicology
screens are positive for cocaine, heroin, and/or methadone;

Predominately prescribes opioid pain medications and other CDS as his
sole method of “pain management;”

Prescribes opioids prior to exhausting alternative therapeutic options such
as injection therapy, physical therapy, chiropractic therapy, or surgery;

Fails to adequately describe the rationale for his prescribing;
Prescribes CDS without seeing the patients for an office visit;

Fails to act in the best interest of patients by denying patients the care
they require by appropriately trained specialists who could provide
interventional and non-interventional procedures to actually alleviate the
pain rather than mask it with opiates; and

Fails to maintain a regular and predictable office schedule which causes
patients to wait many hours to be seen or Respondent to pre-write
prescriptions for patients without seeing them for an office visit, and leads
to disorganization, poor charting, and inability to maintain consistent
staffing.

Prior to Panel B receiving the complaint regarding Respondent's irresponsible

prescribing of opioids, on August 19, 2015, Panel B received a Mandated 10-Day

Report’ (the “Report’) from a hospital in Baltimore City (“Hospital A”),° stating that

* Buprenorphine, sold under the brand name of Suboxone is a prescription medication for people addicted
to heroin or other opiates that acts by relieving the symptoms of opiate withdrawal such as agitation,
nausea and insomnia. Subutex is intended for use at the beginning of treatment while Suboxone is
intended for the maintenance treatment of opiate addiction.
