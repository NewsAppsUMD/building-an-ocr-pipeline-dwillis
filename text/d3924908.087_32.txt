(Drelich’s peer review report at 6.) After that visit, the Respondent performed SPTs on four
more occasions. The Panel finds the repeat SPTs were unnecessary and unjustified.

The Respondent billed for SPTs for Patient 5 on four occasions. The first SPT had a poor
histamine response, but the second SPT (April 19, 2014) had adequate results. Nonetheless, the
Respondent documented that he performed two more SPTs (May 1, 2014, and May 13, 2014).
There was no justification for repeating the SPTs after an adequate response. The Respondent
noted that the patient had a late phase reaction from the SPT from April 19, 2014, but this would
not justify repeat testing.

On May 29, 2014, the Respondent performed a full panel SPT on Patient 9. The
Respondent then unnecessarily repeated the SPT on June 3, 2014. A late phase reaction did not
justify repeat the SPT.

The unnecessary and unindicated testing described above constitutes unprofessional
conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii), and gross
overutilization of health care services, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(19).

3. SPT HISTAMINE RESPONSES

Taking antihistamines within a short period before a SPT will invalidate the SPT, thus a
patient must discontinue taking antihistamines before a SPT. If testing shows a negative
histamine response (an antihistamine was taken too close to the SPT), one does not know if
negative responses to the allergens tested are due to the antihistamine or to the patient being non-
allergic. If there is an invalidated SPT because of a negative histamine response, the physician
should obtain a positive histamine response prior to performing a subsequent SPT, which the

Respondent did not do.
