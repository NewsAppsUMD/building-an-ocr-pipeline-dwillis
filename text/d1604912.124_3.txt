Egbert removed the hoods and helium tanks and disposed of the helium tanks. In each of these
suicides, the death certificates did not list asphyxiation, helium inhalation, or suicide as the cause
of death. Dr. Egbert stipulated that in each of these suicides, the FEN member was not
terminally ill, that is, would not have died within six months. The six FEN members for whom
