ORDER AFTER SHOW CAUSE HEARING

The issue in this case is whether Fysal Henson, Nuclear Medicine Technologist (“NMT”),
has violated the conditions of the Order After Show Cause Hearing executed on August 23, 2022
(“August 2022 Order”) by the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”).

The August 2022 Order followed Mr. Henson’s violations of a Disposition Agreement into
which he entered with the Board on August 27, 2021, and a Participant Rehabilitation Agreement
he signed in September 2021 with the Maryland Professional Rehabilitation Program (“MPRP”).
Following notification from MPRP in October and December 2021 that Mr. Henson had failed to
comply with his Participant Rehabilitation Agreement on multiple occasions, Panel A issued a
Notice of Violation of Board Order and Notice to Show Cause in March.2022 and held a show

violated his 2021 Disposition Agreement and his Participant Rehabilitation Agreement with
MPRP. In the August 2022 Order, Panel A reprimanded Mr. Henson, suspended his license for a
minimum of six months, and required him to reenroll and remain compliant with MPRP and to

enter into a new Participant Rehabilitation Agreement and Rehabilitation Plan.
