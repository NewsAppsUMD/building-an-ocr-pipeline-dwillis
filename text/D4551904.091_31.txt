very little Spanish, would have most certainly known if the Respondent had said the alleged
statements because, as she demonstrated at the beginning of her testimony, she knew the words
contained in those phrases. (Transcript Vol. I, pg. 41). In striking contradiction, the Respondent
argued that those same words were too advanced for his ‘Spanish speaking ability, and were not
words included in his vocabulary. He testified that such phrases would require a “300 level
Spanish” (Transcript Vol. I, pg. 43), alluding to the college-level course one would have to have
taken'to be able to say the phrases alleged. Additionally, in his interview with Ms. Dicken, the
Respondent said that despite having extensive numbers of Spanish-speaking patients, and
communicating with them in Spanish, he has never received a complaint that he does not speak
Spanish well, or should not speak Spanish. (Bd. Ex. 19, pg. 186). His characterization on one
hand, that he has very limited Spanish proficiency, while on the other, that he communicates ©
with an “extensive amount of Spanish patients” and receives “no complaints” about his Spanish
proficiency, points to a disconnect and leads me to conclude that he is hot providing an accurate
evaluation of his ability in the Spanish language.

The Respondent failed to present any credible testimony proving, or suggesting that he
did not, or could not have, made the statements as alleged. .
