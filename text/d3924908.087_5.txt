patient taking an antihistamine or other medication, the SPT should not be repeated unless there
is first a positive histamine response (a result showing the test will not be compromised by
medication). Tr. 119-20.

A SPT is generally not indicated for a patient with dermographism (or
dermatorgraphism), which is a skin condition in which scratching causes a rash or hives. The
dermographism often makes the SPT more difficult and often futile, as the skin condition
interferes with an interpretation of the SPT.

PATCH TESTING (PT)

PT is used to diagnose allergic disorders in a patient who has contact dermatitis.
Indications for PT would be a rash that is suspect for contact dermatitis or a rash that develops
from contact with an allergen. Additionally, another possible indication for PT is eosinophilic
esophagitis, which is an esophageal disorder (an intestinal disorder thought to be related to food
allergies).

Generally, PT involves placing seven to eight large patches on a patient. Each large
patch has 10 individual patch tests. Thus PT generally involves approximately 70-80 individual
patch tests. Each individual patch test concerns an individual allergen. PT generally requires
three visits. The patches are applied during the first visit, and then, after two days, the patient
returns for the patches to be removed and the skin is evaluated by the physician. The patient
returns again, after three to seven days, for a third visit for a second reading.

SPIROMETRY (SP)

SP is a pulmonary function test to diagnose asthma and other lung conditions. SP is

indicated if an upper airway disease is suspected. The test is performed by the patient exhaling

into a machine for a measurement of the amount of air that is exhaled and the velocity of the air.
