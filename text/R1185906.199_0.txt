On September 26, 2018, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
(“Board”) charged Jamal A. Townes, Radiographer, with unprofessional or immoral conduct in
the practice of radiation therapy, radiography, nuclear medicine technology or radiology
assistance and failure to cooperate with a lawful investigation conducted by the Board or a
disciplinary panel. See Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 14-5B-14(a) (3) and (26). On November
30, 2018, the case was referred to the Office of Administrative Hearings (“OAH”) for an
evidentiary hearing.

On December 14, 2018, OAH mailed a Notice of Scheduling Conference to Mr. Townes
and the State, at their respective addresses of record, notifying the parties that a scheduling
conference would be held on December 27, 2018 at 9:30 a.m. at OAH in Hunt Valley, Maryland.
The notice sent to Mr. Townes was not returned to OAH by the United States Postal Service
(“USPS”) as undeliverable. On the day of the scheduling conference, the administrative
prosecutor was present on behalf of the State. Mr. Townes did not appear for the scheduling
conference, and no one appeared on his behalf. The Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) held the
scheduling conference in Mr. Townes’s absence. During the scheduling conference, a

prehearing conference was scheduled for January 22, 2019, at 1:00 p.m., at OAH.
