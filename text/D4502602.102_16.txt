my two brothers, and friends, which is not considered to be -- they’re not my
patient....Now, that is a practice that has changed dramatically over the last few years and
the medical legal implications are very different now. I do regret not having changed my,
or adapted soon enough to the medical legal changes. So, I saw it as the same way when

prescriptions for the Patient “[m]aybe every few months or so.” The Respondent stated,
