peer reviewers cited the following reasons, among others, for their conclusion that the

Respondent failed to maintain adequate medical records:

a. The Respondent maintained patient records with apparent treatment
date gaps (Patients: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10);

db. Some of the Respondent’s clinic notes were vague and/or absent
(Patients: 5, 6, 8 and 9);

c. The Respondent failed to document consistent compliance

monitoring practices (Patients: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10).

B. The Respondent’s Response

14. | The Board provided the peer reviewers’ reports to the Respondent and gave

him an opportunity to review and respond to the reports. On or about December 3, 2020,

the Board received the Respondent’s written response. In his response, the Respondent

stated that the 2016 CDC Guidelines “are erroneously being applied to chronic pain

patients, not just opiate naive patients who were the target of the guidelines.” The

Respondent further stated:

Of the 2000 patients I treat, approximately 150 are maintained on high
dose opiates. That accounts for 7% of my practice. All patients on high
doses are “Legacy Patients” meaning their high doses were prescribed
before the CDC guidelines came out in 2016. . . . In the future, by
following the guidelines for opioid naive patients, we will not have
patients on high doses. Until then, we cannot abandon the [legacy
patients who are functioning thanks to the high-dose opioids
prescribed.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Panel A concludes as a matter of law that

the Respondent is guilty of failing to meet appropriate standards as determined by

appropriate peer review for the delivery of quality medical and surgical care, in violation
