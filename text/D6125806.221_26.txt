As an initial matter, Dr. Singhal misinterprets Health Occ. § 1-212. Section 1-212
requires that all health occupation boards to create regulations to prohibit sexual misconduct and
for disciplinary sanctions to enforce the regulation. Nowhere does the statute state that sexual
conduct that is not listed as prohibited is permissible behavior. Instead, the statute explicitly
states that this addition of sexual misconduct in the regulations “does not negate any other
disciplinary action under a health occupations board’s statutory or regulatory provisions.”
Health Occ. § 1-212(d). The sexual misconduct regulations in effect at the time also reject this
proposition stating, “Health Occupations Article, 14-404(a)(3) .. . includes, but is not limited to,
sexual misconduct.” COMAR 10.32.17.03B (2000).

In this case, the Panel did not charge Dr. Singhal with a violation of the sexual
misconduct statute or regulations and does not find that Dr. Singhal violated the sexual
misconduct regulations. Health Occ. § 1-212; COMAR 10,.32.17.03 (2000). The inapplicability
of the sexual misconduct regulations does not impact whether Dr. Singhal acted immorally or
unprofessionally under Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(i) and (ii). Dr. Singhal argues that the Board

“cannot find certain sexual behavior that is not in the sexual misconduct regulations to be
unprofessional or immoral if it was not a sexual misconduct violation. However, the Board has
full discretion in determining what charge to bring. Maryland Bd. of Physician Quality Assur. v.
Felsenberg, 351 Md. 288, 304 (1998). “A defendant has no constitutional right to elect which of
two applicable statutes will form the basis of his indictment and prosecution.” Felsenberg, 351
Mad. at 304 (quoting Davis v United States, 385 A.2d 757, 759 (D.C. 1978)). In other words, the
Panel need only determine whether the conduct constitutes immoral or unprofessional conduct
under grounds § 14-404(a)(3)(i) and (ii). The existence of another possibly applicable ground

does not negate the Board’s ability to bring an action under the grounds it feels are most
