DISCUSSION

The Board is Maryland’s “governmental agency responsible for investigating and
disciplining physicians for professional misconduct.” Cornfeld y. Bd. of Physicians, 174 Md.
App. 456, 481 (2007). “The Board’s mission [is] to regulate the use of physician’s licenses in
Maryland in order to protect and preserve the public health.” Jd. at 481 (internal quotation marks
and citations omitted). The purpose for the Board’s disciplinary authority is to protect the public,
not to punish physicians. McDonnell v. Comm'n on Med. Discipline, 301 Ma. 426, 436 (1984).

under the Act include the following:

(a) In general. — Subject to the hearirig provisions of § 14-405 of this subtitle, a
disciplinary panel, on the affirmative vote of a majority of the quorum of the
disciplinary panel, may reprimand any licensee, place any licensee on probation,
or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee:
