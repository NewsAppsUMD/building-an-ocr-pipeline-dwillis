FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

On January 13, 2021, Disciplinary Panel A of the Board charged Lisa Hernandez, RCP
with unprofessional or immoral conduct in the practice of respiratory care and professional,
physical, or mental incompetence, in violation of Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 14-5A-17(a)(3)
and (4). The charges followed a Board investigation based on a Mandated 10-day Report received
from a hospital in Baltimore, Maryland (the “Hospital’”’). The Report stated that Ms. Hernandez
resigned from her employment as a respiratory care practitioner prior to being terminated for
deficient clinical skills, inappropriate behavior and communication with her coworkers, and
overall lack of competence.

An evidentiary hearing was held at the Office of Administrative Hearings on September
21, 22, and 28, 2021. The evidence included witness testimony from two witnesses on behalf of
the State and one witness for Ms. Hernandez. In addition, Ms. Hernandez testified on her own
behalf. The Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) also admitted into evidence 11 documentary
exhibits offered by the State.

In a Proposed Decision issued on December 10, 2021, the ALJ recommended that the
charges issued by Panel A be upheld. As a sanction, the ALJ recommended revocation of Ms.
Hernandez’s respiratory care license.

Ms. Hernandez filed written exceptions to the ALJ’s Proposed Decision and the State filed

aresponse. Both parties appeared before Disciplinary Panel B of the Board for an oral exceptions
