Stidwell v. Maryland State Bd. of Chiropractic Exam’rs, 144 Md. App. 613, 619 (2002) (a
criminal offense that undermines the public’s confidence in a profession may be a crime of moral
turpitude if so determined by the appropriate licensing board). Dr. Ajrawat’s repeated fraudulent
billing was “an act of baseness, vileness, or depravity in the private and social duties which a
man owes to his fellow man, or to society in general, contrary to the accepted and customary rule
of right and duty between man and man.” Walman, 280 Md. at 459 (quoting Braverman v. Bar
Ass’n. of Balto., 209 Md. 328, 344, cert. denied, 352 U.S. 830 (1956)). In Panel A’s view, Dr.
Ajrawat’s exploitation of health care programs, obstruction of justice, and aggravated identity
theft disparaged professional principles and disgraced the medical profession. Thus, under any
definition of the term, under Maryland law, Dr. Ajrawat’s convictions constituted crimes of
moral turpitude, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404 (b)(1).

Accordingly, Panel A concludes that Dr. Ajrawat was convicted of multiple crimes
involving moral turpitude. In light of Dr. Ajrawat’s pending appeal, the Panel is mandated to
suspend Dr. Ajrawat’s license to practice medicine.

ORDER

It is, by Board Disciplinary Panel A, hereby:

ORDERED that the license of Paramjit S. Ajrawat, M.D., license number D32506, to
practice medicine in the State of Maryland, is SUSPENDED, as mandated by Health Occ. § 14-
404 (b)(1); and it is further

ORDERED that this Final Decision and Order is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT.
