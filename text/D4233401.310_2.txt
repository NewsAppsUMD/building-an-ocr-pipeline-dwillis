because of deficiencies in his pain management practice, including his prescribing of opioids,
and he failed to keep adequate medical records because they were illegible.

On May 30, 2013, Dr. Jalali was reprimanded by the Pennsylvania State Board of
Medicine and was placed on probation for two years, based on the action taken by the Maryland
Board. His Pennsylvania license expired while he was on probation.

On June 18; 2015, the Maryland Board terminated the probation based on his having
successfully complied with the terms and conditions of probation. The Reprimand remains in
effect.

In July 2018, the Board opened this case based on a complaint about Dr. Jalali’s
prescribing of opioids and began an investigation. During the investigation, the Board obtained
information regarding Dr. Jalali’s competence which then became the basis for the summary
suspension proceeding.

On March 8, 2019, Panel A issued an Order of Summary Suspension of Dr. Jalali’s
license to practice medicine, Panel A afforded him the opportunity to appear before Panel A to
show cause why the suspension should not be continued. The show cause hearing was scheduled
for March 13, 2019.

On March 13, 2019, Panel A held a post-deprivation show cause hearing. The State
presented oral argument in support of the summary suspension. Dr. Jalali did not appear.

On March 14, 2019, Panel A notified the parties that it had determined the public health,
safety or welfare imperatively required the emergency suspension of Dr. Jalali’s license and
reaffirmed the Order of Summary Suspension. Dr. Jalali was notified of his right to appeal the

decision within ten days of the letter.
