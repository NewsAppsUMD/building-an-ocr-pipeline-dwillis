Pe Se:

Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, 354 Md. 59, 76-77 (1999).

Dr. Gianelle’s personal marital status is irrelevant. By gratifying his own sexual desires,
Dr. Gianelle failed to preserve a professional relationship directed solely on Individual A’s
health and welfare and risked losing the objectivity required of a physician providing medical
care. Additionally, his contention that Individual A was not harmed psychologically or
emotionally by his sexual affair with her misses the point. He ignored her obvious emotional
reliance on him during complications of her serious illness. He failed to recognize that his
dishonorable conduct increased the potential for harm to Individual A’s welfare because of the
inherent power differential that applies in a physician-patient relationship. In any event, the
Board does not have to wait for patient harm to occur. “No proof of injury or harm is required to
take disciplinary action against a physician’s license.” Pickert v. Maryland Bd. of Physicians,
180 Md. App. 490, 505 (2008). The Panel rejects Dr. Gianelle’s disingenuous, self-serving
interpretation of his professional obligations and the statute that applies to his conduct. Dr.
Gianelle’s conduct was not only immoral and unprofessional, but inimical to ethical medical
practice and patient protection. His exceptions are denied.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Based on the findings of fact and discussion of Dr. Gianelle’s exceptions, as set forth
above, Disciplinary Panel A concludes that Dr. Gianelle is guilty of immoral and unprofessional
conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation of Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. §§ 14-
404(a)(3)(i) and (ii). The panel also concludes that Dr. Gianelle violated the Board’s sexual
misconduct regulations at COMAR 10.32.17.03D(1) by engaging in a sexual relationship with a

current patient, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(43).
