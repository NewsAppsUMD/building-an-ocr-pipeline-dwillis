e Lay Person A, Vice President of ***, Hospital A
* Physician D, M.D., Medical Director at Hospital A

The Respondent testified on her own behalf.
FINDINGS OF FACT
I find the following facts by a preponderance of the evidence:

1. The Board first licensed the Respondent as a physician assistant in 2008.

2. On October 6, 2008, the Board notified the Respondent in writing it approved her
certification, or license, as a physician assistant and: .

a. She was not free to ‘practice until she and her supervising physician received
approval of a delegation agreement from the Board.

b, She was responsible for notifying the Board of any address changes.

c. She was responsible for renewing the license every two years.

d. She was responsible for familiarizing herself with governing regulations and
statute. .

3. The Respondent renewed her license every two years, as the Board requires, until she
voluntarily permitted the license to lapse on June 30, 2017.7 The Respondent has not
subsequently applied for a license to practice as a physician assistant in Maryland.

4. To practice as a physician assistant in Maryland, the Respondent must: (1) file with the
Board a delegation agreement, which, among other information, identifies a supervising
physician and the specific duties the supervising physician delegates to her; and (2) submit
the required fee.

3 “Unless a disciplinary panel agrees to accept the surrender of a license of a physician assistant, the physician
assistant may not surrender the license nor may the licensure lapse by operation of law while the physician assistant
is under investigation or while charges are pending.” Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 15-312(a). The Board’s,
investigation commenced while the Respondent held a valid license and a disciplinary panel did not accept a
voluntary surrender. Thus, the Board has authority to pursue disciplinary charges against the Respondent’even
though she permitted her license to lapse,
