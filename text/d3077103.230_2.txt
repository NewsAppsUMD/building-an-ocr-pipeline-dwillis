found that Individual A was Dr. Hardi’s patient during the sexual relationship, and as such, he is
guilty of immoral and unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine and engaged in sexual
misconduct, Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(@) & (ii); Health Occ. § 1-212; COMAR 10.32.17. It is
undisputed that Individual A was Dr. Hardi’s patient before and after the sexual relationship.
The ALI based his finding of a concurrent sexual and physician-patient relationship on several
pieces of evidence.

First, Individual A testified that Dr. Hardi concurrently had a sexual relationship with
Individual A while he treated her medically. Individual A testified that he saw her frequently,
but he did not document his involvement, rather, he would write a prescription and provide her

Individual A credible.

- Second, the ALJ noted that Dr Hardi’s name appears on the documents in Individual A’s
medical record for the time period that he was treating her. The record supports this finding.
Patient records from the practice indicate that Dr. Hardi was the ordering physician for lab tests

signed the record on July 25, 2016. Exhibit A2 at 57. The radiologist record from August 2,
2016, regarding the MRI for the Abdomen with and without contrast listed Dr. Hardi as the
requesting physician. Exhibit A2 at 54, 56. Dr. Hardi reviewed and signed the radiologist’s
report on August 11, 2016. Jd. at 53, 55. Dr. Hardi was listed as the referring physician for a
January 17, 2017 record where a PA in the practice is listed as the provider. Exhibit A2 at 160.
That record’s “plan” stated “MRI RLE/right ankle with and w/o contrast.” Exhibit A2 at 160.

That MRI was conducted on January 17, 2017 and Dr. Hardi was listed as the requesting
