i.

The peer reviewers concurred that the Respondent failed to meet the appropriate
standard of quality care for one patient (identified on the peer review reports as
(“Patient 5”) and failed to keep adequate medical records for three patients
(identified on the peer review report as “Patient 5,” “Patient 8,” and “Patient 9”).
The peer reviewers concurred that the Respondent failed to meet the appropriate
standards of quality care for Patient 5 for reasons including, but not limited to:

a) On Patient 5’s initial visit, the Respondent prescribed oxycodone 20 mg
every six hours. Patient 5 had reported that he had been taking oxycodone 15 mg
every six hours. The Respondent failed to verify the source of Patient 5’s previous
prescription and failed to check PDMP prior to prescribing oxycodone at a higher
dosage than Patient 5 reported he had previously been prescribed;

b) The Respondent failed to provide his medical rationale for increasing Patient
5’s oxycodone dosage from 15 mg to 20 mg.

c) The Respondent failed to address Patient 5’s inconsistent urine drug tests
(“UDTs”). Specifically, although Patient 5 reported taking only oxycodone, the
results of his initial UDT was positive for morphine, codeine, and marijuana, but
negative for oxycodone. The Respondent failed to address a second inconsistent
UDT several months later that was positive for opioids and marijuana, and the
Respondent failed to conduct a confirmatory test that would have verified the
presence of oxycodone as opposed to other opiates;

d) The Respondent failed to counsel Patient 5 regarding his marijuana usage;
