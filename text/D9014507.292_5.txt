Grievance Comm’n v. Klauber, 289 Md. 446, 457-59, cert. denied, 451 U.S. 1018 (1981) (the
term “moral turpitude” connotes a fraudulent or dishonest intent); Walman, 280 Md, at 459-60;
Oltman, 162 Md. App. at 485-87. The statutory text is clear that fraud is an essential element of
Mail Fraud, the crime that Dr. Riyaz pled guilty to. In pleading guilty, Dr. Riyaz admitted to
knowingly and willfully having devised or intended to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud
or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses. Therefore, the
crime of Mail Fraud, based on the elements of the crime alone, involves moral turpitude per se.

Dr. Riyaz argues that his crime did not involve moral turpitude because “Tt]here was no
personal gain — no item improperly obtained was used, sold, or displayed ostentatiously.” He
contends that the “items were hoarded as a result of mental illness” and that “[m]ental illness is
not moral illness.” First, Dr. Riyaz’s claim that there was no personal gain contradicts the facts
that he admitted to as part of his guilty plea. Dr. Riyaz admitted that he caused Amazon losses of
over $250,000 and obtained property of over $250,000. Accordingly, the facts underlying Dr.
Riyaz’s guilty plea establish that his crime did involve intentional dishonesty for purposes of
personal gain, and therefore, also establish moral turpitude based on the facts of the case.
Oltman, 162 Md. App. at 486. Dr. Riyaz further claims that his professed mental illness is now
under control and seeks forgiveness from the Panel.

Pursuant to the Board’s regulations, however, the Panel is not permitted to consider any
mitigating factors. COMAR 10.32.02.07E(2)(d). Accordingly, the Panel is legally required to
base its decision solely on the elements of the crime and the facts supporting the guilty plea. Id
The Court of Appeals in Felsenberg confirmed that the intent of the statute is to “direct{]
summary treatment of a charge based on the conviction of a crime of moral turpitude.”
