stated that there was an “overwhelming smell of alcohol on [the Respondent’s] breath
and everyone in the facility could pick up on this pretty early on...and her behaviors, and
the way she was acting as an athletic trainer didn’t seem ethically sound.”

Interview of the Respondent

37. On October 14, 2022, Board staff conducted an under-oath interview of the
Respondent. In this interview, the Respondent stated:

I was told that I did the wrong thing about the DUI that I got in July and not

reporting it. What was frustrating from that end was | was still trying to

figure out legally if it was even something to bring up...I did personally

start to drink more at home and I was told that I’ve been smelling like

alcohol. No one told me...so I didn’t even know that that was a problem. |

did drink on the [College] property[,] but it was not during work. And there

was evidence found in my locker. My own fault for not taking care of that.

But once again that wasn’t me trying to hide it, and it wasn’t me putting

anyone’s life in jeopardy. I just made very terrible decisions and I’m

completely admitting that.

38. The Respondent explained that she “had a lot of things happen within the
past month personally that did contribute” to her drinking more at home.

39. The Respondent admitted to drinking on the property of the College on
September 8, 2022. She had purchased a twelve pack of an alcoholic beverage the night
before and it was in her car. She took the twelve pack out of her car and put it into her
bookbag so that no one would see her with the alcohol. She then went into a remote area
of the College and consumed most of the twelve pack alone.

40. After consuming the alcohol, the Respondent put the empty containers in

the brown paper Wawa bag in her locker. She stated, “I wasn’t trying to hide it, but I put

it in there because I felt like it was going to be easier to throw out in the long run.”
