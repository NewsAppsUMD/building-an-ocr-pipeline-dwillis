approved and sent her another copy of the Board-approved course list.

On May 31, 2019, Board staff sent Ms. Kwakye a letter reminding her that the ethics course
was required to be completed by July 29, 2019. On June 5, 2019, Board staff received
correspondence from Ms. Kwakye that she planned to take the PBI Medical Ethics and
Professionalism course. Board staff notified Ms. Kwakye that the course was approved and that
there was an upcoming session on June 21-22, 2019 in California. On June 25, 2019, Board staff
received notification from Ms. Kwakye that she was unable to take the course because her daughter
was born earlier than expected on June 20, 2019. Ms. Kwakye informed the Board that she planned
on taking another session of the PB1 Medical Ethics course and the Board granted an extension
until November 3, 2019 for Ms. Kwakye to complete the course. In the letter granting the
extension, Board staff asked Ms. Kwakye to provide documentation that she had enrolled in the
course and Ms. Kwakye was informed that her failure to complete the course by November 3, 2019
may constitute a violation of the Consent Order. Ms. Kwakye did not provide documentation that
she enrolled in the course and Board staff verified that Ms. Kwakye did not attend the ethics course.

On November 4, 2019, Board staff sent a letter to Ms. Kwakye requesting a response to
her failure to complete the ethics course by the extended due date of November 3, 2019. Ms.
Kwakye responded and explained that she failed to take the course because she was caring for her
two ill children. She did not state that she would take another course to satisfy the requirement or
provide documentation that she had enrolled in a different course that would satisfy the
requirements of the Consent Order. On December 4, 2019, Panel A voted to issue a Notice to

Show Cause to Ms. Kwakye.
