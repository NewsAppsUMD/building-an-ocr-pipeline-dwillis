appellate courts have repeatedly held that if dishonesty, fraud, or intent to deceive is an essential
element of a statute under which a defendant is convicted, the crime involves moral turpitude as a
matter of law. See Board of Physician Quality Assurance v. Felsenberg, 351 Md. 288, 295 (1998)
(crimes involving fraud are crimes involving moral turpitude); Attorney Grievance Comm’n v.
Klauber, 289 Md. 446, 457-59, cert. denied, 451 U.S. 1018 (1981) (the term “moral turpitude”
connotes a fraudulent or dishonest intent); Walman, 280 Md. at 459-60; Oltman, 162 Md. App. at
485-87.

In pleading guilty, Dr. Raley admitted to “knowingly and willfully soliciting or receiving
remuneration in return for referring patients to specific pharmacies for the furnishing, and/or
arranging for the furnishing, of items and services for which payment was made, in whole or in
part, under a Federal health care program, namely TRICARE, Medicare, and Medicaid[.]” The
elements of the crime Dr. Raley pled guilty to under 18 U.S.C. § 371 includes the intent to defraud
the United States. 18 U.S.C. § 371 states, “If two or more persons conspire either to commit any
offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in any
manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the
conspiracy, each shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.”
Further, the factual basis for the crime of conspiracy to receive health care kickbacks involved
intentional dishonesty for purposes of personal gain, which also constitutes a crime involving
moral turpitude. Walman, 280 Md. at 459-60.

Dr. Raley also admitted to “knowingly and with the intent to defraud, devising and
intending to devise, a scheme and artifice to defraud insurance companies and for obtaining money
and property by means of materially false and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises;
