her “practice patterns resulted in a clinically significant poorer outcome than would have
been expected.”

Upon receipt of Hospital A’s report, the Board initiated an investigation, which
included a peer review of several of the Respondent's surgical cases. Based upon the
peer reviewers’ findings, Panel A charged the Respondent with professional
incompetence, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(4) and failure to meet appropriate
standards for the delivery of quality medical and surgical care, in violation of Health
Occ. § 14-404(a)(22).

On March 10, 2015, the Respondent entered into a Consent Order with Panel A
to resolve the charges. Under the terms of the Consent Order, the Respondent was
reprimanded and placed on probation for a minimum of two years. The Respondent
was ordered to successfully complete a Board-approved remedial course in medical
record-keeping. The Respondent was also ordered to successfully complete a Board-
approved course in pain management because she had shifted the focus of her practice
from surgery to pain management. The Respondent was further required to undergo a
peer review.
