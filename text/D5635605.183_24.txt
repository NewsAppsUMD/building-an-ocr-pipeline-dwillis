 

B. Respondent Telling Complainant 2 that Wanted to Spank Her
Complainant 2 testified that on one occasion she
walked out of the OR — towards the OR front desk to sit down. It
was near the end of my shift. Dr. Benalcazar shortly followed me
out saying that he wanted to, ‘take me over his knee and spank me.’”

Complainant 2’s testimony was corroborated by Individual 3, who testified that

Respondent told Complainant 2 that he wanted to spank her. The Respondent’s testimony on this
incident indicates that the Respondent is not a reliable witness.

C. The Respondent and Individual 4

When the Respondent was initially interviewed by Board investigators, he was asked
whether he was “familiar” with Individual 4 (an OR secretary), who was referred to by her first

of Individual 4. The Board investigators mentioned that she avoided the Respondent after the
Respondent began bringing her coffee. Still, the Respondent said he had no recollection of her.
The investigators mentioned that she asked him to stop bringing her coffee because it made her

uncomfortable and asked the Respondent whether he brought her coffee. The Respondent

responded that he did have a “very little recollection of this but certainly possible that that would
