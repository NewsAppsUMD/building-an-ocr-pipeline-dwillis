4. As part of its investigation, the Board obtained certain employment records
for the Respondent from the Agency. Included in the Respondent’s records was a “Drug
Consent” form that she signed on or about October 1, 2019, which stated in relevant part:

I understand that if any urine drug test results are dilute or dilute
negative, I will be required to take a second urine drug test within 24
hours of [the Agency’s] receipt of the result. I understand that if the
second urine drug test is also dilute or dilute negative, I will be
required to undergo blood drug testing. Blood drug testing must be
completed within 24 hours of [the Agency’s] receipt of the result.

5. Also included in the Respondent’s records that the Board obtained from the
Agency were a “Review Board Decision” and “Review Board Checklist,” both dated
February 6, 2020, and which noted that the Respondent “had 2 dilutes & refused a blood
draw.” The checklist form noted the Respondent was “non-rehirable.”

6. Also included in the Respondent’s records that the Board obtained from the
Agency were the results of two urine drug screens. The first result, dated February 4, 2020,
had a certified result of “dilute.” The second result, dated February 6, 2020, also had a
certified result of “dilute.”

7. On or about July 14, 2020, the Board sent a letter to the Respondent at her
address on file with the Board as well as to a second address found through a records search.
The Board’s letter notified the Respondent of the nature of the complaint filed against her
and directed her to file a written response within ten business days from the date of the

letter. The Board did not receive a written response from the Respondent.
