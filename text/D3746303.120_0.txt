Re: Surrender of License to Practice Medicine
Rita Judita Kolycius, M.D., License Number: D37463

Case Number: 2229-0035 A
Dear Dr. Bhandari and Members of the Disciplinary Panel A,

Please be advised that, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. (“Health Oce.”)
§14-403 (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2017 Supp.), Ihave decided to SURRENDER my license to
practice medicine in the State of Maryland, License Number: D37463, effective
immediately. 1 understand that upon surrender of my license, I may not give medical
advice or treatment to any individual, with or without compensation, and cannot prescribe
medications or otherwise engage in the practice of medicine in the State of Maryland as it
is defined in the Maryland Medical Practice Act (the “Act”), Health Occ. §§ 14-101 ef
seq. and other applicable laws. In other words, as of the effective date of this Letter of
Surrender, I understand that the surrender of my license means that J am in the same
position as an unlicensed individual in the State of Maryland.

I understand that this Letter of Surrender is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT, and upon
Disciplinary Panel A’s (“Panel A”) acceptance, becomes a FINAL ORDER of Panel A
of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”).

T acknowledge that the Board initiated an investigation that found the following:
On September 21, 2018, I completed the 2018 license renewal application. In this
application, I checked that I had completed the Criminal History Records Check
(“CHRC”), but in fact I did not complete the process. On January 22, March 6 and May
28, 2019, the Board notified me that it had not received the CHRC results and offered me
ten days to provide the requested information. I have decided to surrender my license to
practice medicine in the State of Maryland to avoid further investigation and prosecution
of these allegations and because I no longer wish to pursue renewal of my Maryland
license, due to the fact that 1 no longer reside in the United States. I recognize that for all
purposes relevant to medical licensure that these allegations shall be treated as proven
and that these allegations support a conclusion that I violated Health Occ. § [4-
404(a)(42), (“Fails to submit to a criminal history records check under §14-308.1 of this
title.)
