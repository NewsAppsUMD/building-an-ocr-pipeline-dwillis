and retrospective studies in his testimony, his acceptance of Dr. MacKoul’s self-serving
representations underscores the extent to which Dr. Prentice then ignored his distinctions and the
facts, reality, and context of Dr. MacKoul’s actions.

Considered against the backdrop of Dr. MacKoul’s statements in his October 31, 2016
manuscript from 2013 - 2016, and his testimonial description and explanations to the Board about
his surgical activities, Dr. Prentice’s belief that Dr. MacKoul’s only purpose was innovation and
the improvement of the quality of patient care does not hold up. His opinion is implausible and is
directly contradicted by the systematic nature and methods of Dr. MacKoul’s surgical
interventions and his research team’s accrual of detailed statistical data for that three-year period.

While Dr. MacKoul’s placement of Ethibond sutures may have had the incidental effect of
benefiting some of the 595 Ethibond patients in the study who may have been at risk for VCD, Dr.
MacKooul testified that he did not select patients based on their particular risks or medical histories
for the study. Dr. MacKoul’s primary motivation in his study was to obtain valid scientific data
about the efficacy or safety of Ethibond versus Vicryl sutures, and to compare success rates. Dr.
Prentice ignored Dr. MacKoul’s own sworn account of his surgical activities to the Board, which
provides no indication that his primary focus was innovation, quality improvement, the benefit of
individual patients, or a selection of high or low risk patients for those purposes.

Dr. MacKoul’s exceptions arguments overlook the strong factual and legal bases for Dr.
Shamoo’s opinion and the record evidence on which he relied. The Panel rejects Dr. MacKoul’s
claim that the ALJ arbitrarily deferred to the opinion of Dr. Shamoo and denies his exception on
this issue. As a physician licensed by the Board, Dr. MacKoul was ethically and legally required

to conduct human subject research in accordance with the protections afforded by the federal
