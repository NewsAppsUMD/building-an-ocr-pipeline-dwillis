Respondent's response to his refusal was “belligerent....and...threatening.” The loud,
angry tone of the Respondent's voice during the telephone conversation necessitated
that the CMO abruptly terminate the call.

20. On or about August 1, 2016, the CMO wrote a letter to the Respondent that
Hospital B had received a complaint the Respondent had been acting unprofessionally
in the presence of a patient (“Patient B”) that included “yelling” at Patient B with regard
to changing her code status. When Nurse A, Patient B’s assigned nurse, attempted to
speak with the Respondent about Patient B, the Respondent reacted by telling Nurse A
he was incompetent, taking his (the Respondent’s) hearing aids out, plugging his ears
with his fingers and walking away. The CMO described the Respondent’s conduct as
“concerning” and that he was being evaluated pursuant to Hospital B’s Disruptive
Medical Staff Member policy.

21. Also, on or about August 1, 2016 the CMO wrote a letter to the Respondent
notifying him that he had engaged in unprofessional behavior toward the nursing and
volunteer staff when he made condescending remarks and yelled at staff with regard to
another patient's care (“Patient C”). The CMO noted, “Dr. Rustagi has shown a period
of unprofessional behavior that has affected many staff members of late...”

22. On or about August 18, 2016, Board staff conducted an interview of the CMO.
He stated that Hospital B is presently evaluating the allegations with regard to the

Respondent's conduct indicating that recent behaviors “point to a larger issue.”
