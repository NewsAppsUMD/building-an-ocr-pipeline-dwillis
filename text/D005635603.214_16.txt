 

22. Following this interview, Respondent’s counsel informed Board staff that the
Respondent had recalled additional information. A second under-oath interview
of the Respondent was conducted on May 25, 2021. In this interview, the

Respondent stated:

a. That he initially did not recall Individual 4 because he called her by her
nickname “Strawberry.” He acknowledged bringing her coffee and stated
that the two of them began a romantic relationship outside of work. He
recalled an occasion wherein he invited her into his administrative office,
and she drove there specifically to have an encounter with him. The
Respondent stated that he ended the relationship after Individual 4
demanded money from him.

b. He could not tell Board staff the whole truth in the first interview not
because he could not remember, but because he had to “put some type of
coherent thing together.”
