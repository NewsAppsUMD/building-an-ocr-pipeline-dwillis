that the Respondent’s delivery of the glasses to the family’s mailbox is not consistent with
clinically appropriate behavior.

PATIENT-SPECIFIC FINDINGS

43. In addition to the above general findings, the peer reviewers concurred that
the Respondent failed to meet the standard of quality care for nine of the ten patients for
reasons including, but not limited to:

a. The Respondent diagnosed and treated pediatric patients with prism glasses,

in the absence of symptoms or clinical indications of strabismus (Patients | -7, 9 —

10). Both Peer Reviewers expressed concern regarding the Respondent’s frequent

use of unnecessary prism glasses to treat pediatric patients based primarily on

subclinical (“flick”) findings. The Respondent often merely documented “head tilt”

or left hypertropia with no numeric documentation of the degree of head tilt, or the

amount of deviation in prism diopters (Patients 1 — 7, 9-10). Ophthalmologists do

not diagnose or treat eye disorders based on head tilt alone;

b. The Respondent treated asymptomatic patients with prism glasses over a

long period of time, often several years. The Respondent “urged” patients to wear

the prism glasses full time and during frequent office visits regularly increased the
