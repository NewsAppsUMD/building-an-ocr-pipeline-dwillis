149. The pathology report prepared for the specimens submitted from November 5,
2012 noted that the biopsy specimens were “re-shave[s]”,“° yet Practice A (for Physician
A's services) again billed CPT code 11402 for two excisions conducted on the same
sites documented on October 18.

150. A few months later, on May 7, 2013, Patient O saw Physician A for a skin check,
and Physician A again conducted a shave biopsy of the same lesion on Patient O’s right
lower back (biopsied on October 18 and November 6, 2012). Again, Practice A (for
Physician A’s services) billed Patient O’s insurance company for an excision of a benign
lesion (CPT code 11402) instead of a shave biopsy (CPT code 11302).

151. The Respondent was the reviewing pathologist for the May 7, 2013 shave biopsy
specimen, and diagnosed the lesion as severe dysplastic nevus, requiring “complete re-
excision.” She billed Patient O’s insurance company for surgical pathology, gross and
microscopic ($180) and immunohistochemistry ($370).

152. There was no documented justification in Patient O’s record for the Respondent
to conduct immunohistochemistry staining.

153. Approximately one month later, on June 20, 2013, Physician A conducted a “re-
excision” of a right lower back lesion, which showed the margins to be free of residual
melanocytic lesion. The Respondent was the reviewing pathologist.

154. The Respondent was the principal owner of Practice A.

155. The Respondent, as owner of Practice A, received financial benefit from its

providers’ billing.

20 Re-shaves should have been coded as CPT code 11302.
