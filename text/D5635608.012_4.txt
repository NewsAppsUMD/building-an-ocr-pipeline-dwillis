13. The Respondent talked about how he could get people fired, which caused
Complainant 2 to be afraid to report him. Complainant 2 stated that she asked her supervisors to
change her schedule but did not state that it was because of the Respondent. She believed that
her supervisors knew the reason that she wanted to change because she had told them many
times before about how uncomfortable she was, but the supervisor did not ask for the reason.
Ultimately, Complainant 2 was able to get her schedule changed so she did not have to work with
the Respondent any longer. On October 16, 2018, Complainant 2 filed a complaint with the
Hospital’s Human Resources department.

Patient 1

14. On April 19, 2017, a female patient, Patient 1, was in the O.R. and unconscious
after being anesthetized. Patient 1 was positioned for a lumbar procedure on her spinal column.
Patient | was lying on her abdomen, face down, and her buttocks were fully exposed. From her
neck to her feet there were no clothes or sheets covering her. The Respondent came into the
room and did not like the way a physician assistant had taped the skin of the patient, and the
Respondent ripped the tape off the patient. The Respondent made comments about how good
Patient 1 looked and that her buttocks looked great. The Respondent then forcefully slapped
Patient 1’s buttocks, which made a loud noise. The Respondent then sang the verse “Baby Got
Back” and was giggling. The Respondent told Individual 9 (a physician assistant) to re-tape the
patient. At least three O.R. workers witnessed this incident: Individual 9, Complainant 2, and
Individual 5. There was no medical justification for the Respondent to slap the patient’s
buttocks.
