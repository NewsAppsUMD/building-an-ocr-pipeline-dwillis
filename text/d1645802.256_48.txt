Patient F

Patient F knew of the Respondent’s pain management practice prior to becoming a
patient of his due to the fact that his wife and two stepdaughters were patients of the practice.
Patient F is morbidly obese and has damaged knee tendons, knee cartilages, and tendons due to
repetitive gravitational trauma. He is not a candidate for gastric bypass surgery.

Patient F was prescribed a SAO, Percocet, even though he has chronic pain that has
lasted more than three months. Again, drug screens were not ordered to verify compliance with
prescribed medication. Other modalities of treatment were not mentioned in the medical records
and there is no other evidence that they were considered, including the use of anticonvulsants.
Patient G

Patient G came to the Respondent's practice from the American Spine Center. He had
been suffering for years with neck, lumbar, back, and shoulder pain as a result of a motor vehicle
accident. While at the American Spine Center, he was prescribed Methadone, 60 mg. daily. Dr.
Wright stated in her report that Methadone prescribed for this patient was given because the
patient must have had a history of opioid abuse. (State Ex. #32). The Respondent claims that
there was no suggestion that he was on methadone because he was an abuser, but most certainly
that he had in the past been on other opioids similar to morphine. (Tr. 317). I do not find the
Respondent’s testimony credible. The Respondent explained that it was his goal to immediately.
cease the methadone and replace it with a Fentanyl patch, which he deemed successful. The
Respondent explained that morphine based medications cause a stupefying effect that impacts
intellectual and mental abilities. I do not find it credible that the physicians at the American
Spine Center would place Patient G on methadone, knowing the side effects of this treatment,

when other treatments were available that did not have the impact on mental function that
