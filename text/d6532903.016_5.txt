 

was recorded on Caller ID. Patient A’s wife immediately called that number. Dr. Abassi
answered her call, and they spoke. Dr. Abassi requested that she ask Patient A to call him. Until
this telephone conversation, neither Patient A nor his wife had ever spoken with Dr. Abassi, ever
attempted to contact him, or knew who he was. There is no dispute that Dr. Abassi had never
met nor had any contact with Patient A or his wife prior to January 3, 2014. The testimony of
Patient A’s wife is consistent with the Hospital’s computer records.

Dr. Abassi’s versions of events are inconsistent and belied by the Hospital’s records. Dr.
Abassi had repeatedly denied that he accessed Patient A’s records. On February 28, 2014, Dr.
Abassi wrote to the Board, “I did not access any of [Patient A’s] records. I had no reason to
access [Patient A’s] records because he decided not to establish any relationship with my office.”
(Joint Exhibit 4, at 3.) Also, when Dr. Abassi testified before the hospital, he was asked whether
he accessed Patient A’s records and answered, “No, no, no. I was not accessing. I did not access.
And even in my response to the state, I had mentioned I did not access [Patient A’s] chart.”
(Joint Exhibit 10-30, Transcript, April 2, 2014, at 198.) And when Dr. Abassi testified before the
ALJ, he was asked whether he recalled accessing the hospital’s records associated with Patient A
and testified, “No, Your Honor. No, I do not.” (Transcript, July 22, 2015, at 346.) Later in his
testimony before the ALJ, however, Dr. Abassi changed his position, stating that, on January 3,
2014, he may have, or did, unintentionally access Patient A’s electronic record. (Transcript, July
22, 2015, at 395.)

The Panel finds that Dr. Abassi’s testimony is not credible. The Hospital’s computer
system recorded that Dr. Abassi accessed Patient’s electronic file. He accessed Patient A’s

electronic file approximately 85 minutes before Patient A’s wife saw Dr. Abassi’s telephone
