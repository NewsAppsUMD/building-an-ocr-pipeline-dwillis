in compliance.” Peer Reviewer 1 also found that the
Respondent relied too heavily on unwitnessed office-based
urine drug screens that were unreliable. As a result, “[The
Respondent] miss[ed] many opportunities to not only confront
his patients with their continued drug abuse but to mandate
professional addiction treatment. These patients were not
afforded the opportunity to confront their addictive behaviors
and potentially achieve sobriety.”

 

b. The Respondent prescribed CDS to these patients and risked
relapses and/or overdoses. He prescribed opioids to known
opioid addicts and benzodiazepines to an alcohol-dependent
patient.

c. The Respondent continued to prescribe Suboxone to patients
with known medical conditions such as liver disease and
pregnancy, when Subutex (pure buprenorphine) was a safer
alternative. He also continued to prescribe Suboxone to a
patient whose toxicology screens repeatedly showed non-
compliance.

vi. The Respondent did not have patients return for specifically
designated appointments to address chronic problems (ie,
hypertension, Hepatitis C, chronic pain and chronic cough) that often
require frequent visits to resolve or stabilize.

The Respondent’s Response

17. The Board provided the Respondent with the peer reviewers’ findings. By
letter dated November 20, 2019, the Respondent submitted his response. In his cover letter,
the Respondent stated, “working in the inner city of Baltimore has been my toughest and
most demanding challenge yet” and “the stress of working has left me with a burnt-out
feeling.” The Respondent also affirmed that he reviewed each urine drug screen for the

patients whose charts were peer reviewed.
