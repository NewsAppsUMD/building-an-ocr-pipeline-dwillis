electronic mail and overnight delivery, directing him to appear at MPRP on Tuesday,
April 9 at 1:00 p.m. for an intake evaluation. Respondent was advised that his
unreasonable failure or refusal to submit to an examination is prima facie evidence of a
licensed medical practitioner’s inability to practice medicine. -

stating “I need an attendant to accompany me due to my ambulation problems. ..it’s
_ beyond my control now...my housekeeper does not feel comfortable driving me to
Baltimore.” Respondent did not appear for the third scheduled evaluation.

23. On April 9, 2019, Respondent left two telephone messages with Board
staff, stating the reason he fell the night before was “the bed is too high for my physical

the rescue squad come.”

CONCLUSION OF LAW

 

Based upon the foregoing Investigative Findings, the Board concludes that the
public health, safety, or welfare imperatively requires emergency action, and that
pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2), Respondent's license must be

immediately suspended.
