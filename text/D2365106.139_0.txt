Re: Ernesto Torres, M.D.
Case No.: 2219-0183
License No.: D23651

Dear Dr. Torres and Counsel:

On May 28, 2019, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued
an ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE in
this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2018
Supp.). Dr. Torres was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing before
Disciplinary Panel A to show cause why that suspension should not be continued on June 12,
2019. Dr. Torres attended the hearing and was represented by counsel, Margaret Teahan. The
State was represented by Michael Brown, Administrative Prosecutor. At the hearing, Dr. Torres
agreed that his license should remain suspended at the present time, and therefore, neither party
presented any arguments in opposition to the continuance of the summary suspension.

After considering the presentations of the parties at the hearing and the investigative file,
Disciplinary Panel A determined that it would continue the summary suspension imposed on
May 28, 2019. The order of summary suspension is thus reaffirmed and will continue. COMAR
10.32.02.08H(1).

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board’s regulations, Dr. Torres has the right to request a full evidentiary hearing
before an Administrative Law Judge. This request will be granted if the Board receives a written
request for a hearing within TEN (10) days of the date of this letter. Any request for a hearing
