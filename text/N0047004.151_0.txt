Dear Mr. Muller and Mr, Gilbert:

On March 30, 2021, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
NUCLEAR MEDICINE TECHNOLOGY, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-
226(c)(2), concerning Mr. Muller’s license to practice nuclear medicine technology in Maryland.

On April 14, 2021, Disciplinary Panel A held the post-deprivation hearing by video-
conference. Mr. Muller appeared and represented himself. The State was represented by, Robert

license to practice nuclear medicine technology. See State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2)(i). The order of
summary suspension is, thus, reaffirmed, and Mr. Muller’s license to practice nuclear medicine
technology in Maryland remains summarily suspended. See COMAR 10.32.02.08H(1).
