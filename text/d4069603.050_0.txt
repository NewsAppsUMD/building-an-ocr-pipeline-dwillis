Re: Surrender of License to Practice Medicine
Christian Evans, M.D.

License Number: D40696

Case Number: 7720-0046

Dear Dr. Freas and Members of the Disciplinary Panel B

Please be advised that, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. (“Health Occ.”)
§4-403 (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2019 Supp.), I have decided to SURRENDER my license to
practice medicine in the State of Maryland, License Number D40696, effective
immediately. I understand that upon surrender of my license, I may not give medical
advice or treatment to any individual, with or without compensation, and cannot prescribe
medications or otherwise engage in the practice of medicine in the State of Maryland as it
is defined in the Maryland Physician Assistants Practice Act (the “Act”), Health Occ. §§
14-101 et seg. and other applicable laws. In other words, as of the effective date of this
Letter of Surrender, I understand that the surrender of my license means that ] am in the
same position as an unlicensed individual in the State of Maryland.

I understand that this Letter of Surrender is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT, and upon
Disciplinary Panel B’s (“Panel B”) acceptance, becomes a FINAL ORDER of Panel B
of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”).

I acknowledge that the Board initiated an investigation of my practice and on August 14,
2019, Panel B issued disciplinary charges against me under Health Occ. § 14-
404(a)(3)(ii) (unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine). I resolved these
disciplinary charges through entering into a Consent Order with Panel B, dated
November 12, 2019, in which Panel B found that I violated Health Occ. § 14-
404(a)(3)(ii). The Consent Order imposed a reprimand and placed me on probation for a
minimum of two (2) years with certain terms and conditions, including that I enroll in the
Maryland Professional Rehabilitation Program (MPRP), take a one-to-one tutorial in
professional workplace behavior, and pay a $5,000.00 fine. A copy of the Consent Order
is attached and incorporated herein as Attachment 1.
