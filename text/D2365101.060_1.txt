 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW _

Based upon the Findings of Fact, Panel B concludes that the Order for Summary
Suspension, issued on May 28, 2019, against Dr. Torres is imperatively required to protect the
public health, safety, and welfare. See State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2).

Panel B does not adopt the ALJ *s statements pertaining to § 14-404(a)(3)(i) and (ii) of the
Health Occupations Article, Annotated Code of Maryland (immoral or unprofessional conduct in
the practice of medicine). This proceeding does not concern § 14-404(a)(3) of the Health
Occupations Article, This proceeding, instead, concerns the adjudication of the summary
suspension under § 10-226(c)(2) of the State Government Article. The ALJ, therefore,
mistakenly addressed whether Dr. Torres engaged in immoral or unprofessional conduct in the
practice of Maryland. (ALJ’s Proposed Decision at page 20.) While summary suspension
proceedings are often consolidated with charges brought under § 14-404, that did not occur in
this summary suspension proceeding. Because § 14-404(a)(3) was not at issue in this
proceeding, Panel B does not adopt the ALJ’s references, discussion, findings, or conclusions
pertaining to § 14-404(a)(3).

Specifically, the Panel does not adopt the following language from the ALJ’s Proposed
Decision: (1) on page 1, “that the Respondent’s conduct is immoral or unprofessional in the
practice of medicine and”; (2) also, on page 1, “Md. Code Ann., Health Oce, § 14-404(a)(3)(4)
and (ii) (2014 & Supp. 2018)”; (3) on page 2, in the Issues, “Does a preponderance of the
evidence support the Board’s determination that the Respondent engaged in immoral or
unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine; and if so”; (4) on page 10, “the Respondent’s
action constituted immoral or unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, and”; (5) on

page 11, “the Respondent engaged in immoral ‘and unprofessional conduct in the practice of
