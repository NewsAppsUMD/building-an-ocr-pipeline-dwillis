panel STPs for Patient 9, which included tests that were excessive and irrelevant. (Dr. Jani, Tr.
92; Dr. Drelich, Tr. 249.)

The Respondent billed for a full Panel STP on Patient 10, which included an excessive
number of unnecessary testing for specific allergens. Dr. Drelilch testified, “I do not see an
indication for food allergy testing.” (Tr. 251.) Dr. Jani testified, “Again, an excessive number of
skin tests not supported by the patient complaints.” (Tr. 94.) Additionally, there was no
indication for the PT the Respondent performed on Patient 10. And, as mentioned previously,
the Respondent billed for more PT than he actually performed. The Respondent then failed to
show up for the subsequent two follow-up appointments, thus, the Respondent was not able to
read the results of the PT.

Performing the unnecessary and unindicated testing, as described above, constitutes gross
overutilization of health care services, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(19).

2. UNNECESSARY REPEAT SPTs

Patient 2 complained of chronic hives, which the patient had for approximately two years
prior to his first visit with the Respondent. The Respondent, nonetheless, performed SPT on at
least five occasions, and billing $2640 for SPTs on five occasions for a total of $13,200. Dr.
Drelich correctly explained that a patient with hives “would, in fact, make skin testing very
difficult to perform or interpret.” He further testified, there was “both excessive and unnecessary
allergy skin testing for environmental and food allergies in a patient with two years of chronic
urticarial [hives] which he — ultimately, dermographism does not merit any of that testing.” The
SPT results, in fact, were equivocal or generalized. During the first visit, the Respondent
performed a SPT with equivocal results, and RAST testing was obtained. After this visit, as Dr.

Drelich explained in his peer review report, “any further skin testing would not be necessary.”
