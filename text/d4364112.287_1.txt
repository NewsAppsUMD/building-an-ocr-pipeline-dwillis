31, 1992. He allowed his license to expire on September 30, 2017.7

2. The Respondent's primary self-designated concentrations are internal medicine
and pediatrics; however, he is not board-certified in any medical specialty.

Medicine (“D.C. Board”). He allowed his license to expire in 2010, following disciplinary

action that was initiated in 2005.°

4. The Respondent is not presently licensed to practice medicine in any State or
jurisdiction.
5. During all times relevant to this suspension, the Respondent was employed

approximately 40 hours weekly at an urgent care center located in Potomac, Maryland
(“Facility B”).*

6. On June 23, 2017, Panel A charged the Respondent under the Maryland Medical
Practice Act pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii)(unprofessional
conduct in the practice of medicine) and (27)(sells, prescribes, gives away, or
administers drugs for illegal or illegitimate medical purposes), based on investigative

? Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. II § 14-403 provides in pertinent part, “...the individual may not
surrender the license...nor may the license...lapse by operation of law while the individual is
under investigation or while charges are pending.”

3 On or about September 20, 2005, the D.C. Board summarily suspended the Respondent's
medical license for prescribing large amounts of CDS to a patient after terminating their
physician-patient relationship and without documenting the CDS prescriptions in a medical
record. Based on these investigative findings, by Order dated May 16, 2006, the D.C. Board
revoked the Respondent’s medical license. The D.C. Board terminated the Respondent’s
probation retroactive to December 31, 2008. The Respondent allowed his D.C. license to expire
in 2010. On August 27, 2008, the Maryland Board imposed reciprocal action based on the D.C.
Board’s Order, and placed the Respondent on one year of probation. By Order dated April 7,
2010, the Maryland Board terminated the Respondent’s probation.
