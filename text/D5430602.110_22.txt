(g) the Respondent failed to document or undertake a periodic assessment of
suicide risk.

Supplemental response

45. The Respondent submitted a written supplemental response to the Board,
dated May 24, 2019, in which he addressed the peer reviewers’ findings. The
Respondent stated that he was “dismayed by [his] performance,” but was “determined to
have a practice that is commensurate with the Board’s expectations.” The Respondent
acknowledged some of the deficiencies the reviewers noted, such as: his failure to obtain
laboratory testing for some of the psychotropic medications that he routinely prescribes,
and his failure to undertake other forms of monitoring when prescribing these
medications; the lack of comprehensiveness of his MSEs; and his failure to specifically
note a suicide assessment in his treatment notes. The Respondent acknowledged that it
would be beneficial for him to consult with a supervisor to address these deficiencies.
The Respondent stated, “I need to gain greater familiarity with treatment guidelines for
the various disorders I treat.”
