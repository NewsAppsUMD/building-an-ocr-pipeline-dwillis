subspecialty certifications in pain medicine. The reviewers evaluated the treatment the
Respondent provided to the patients whose charts were the subject of its May 6, 2021, SDT.

10. These patients (referred to infra as “Patients 1 through 10”) were adults for whom
the Respondent provided primary care and chronic pain management, typically for an extended
period of years. The Respondent typically prescribed immediate-release opioid medications (e.g.,
15 and 30 mg oxycodone, hydrocodone, Tramadol) for these patients, often in conjunction with
extended-release opioid medications (e.g. Fentanyl patch, OxyContin, MS Contin, hydrocodone
ER). In addition to the Respondent’s prescribing of these combinations of high-dose opioids (7.e.,
99 to 395 MME) for these patients, the Respondent often also prescribed other CDS, such as
benzodiazepines (e.g., alprazolam, diazepam), stimulants (e.g., methylphenidate) and/or
carisoprodol.

11. The reviewers independently concluded that in all ten cases reviewed, the
Respondent failed to meet appropriate standards for the delivery of quality medical care and failed
to keep adequate medical records. Examples of deficiencies include but are not limited to the
following:

(a) The Respondent inappropriately prescribed high-dose opioid medications (greater

than 90 MME) without appropriate justification or adequately documenting such

justification (Patients 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10);

(b) The Respondent inappropriately prescribed high-dose opioid medications, often

in conjunction with other CDS, without adequately documenting or undertaking sufficient

monitoring/oversight to ensure compliance, including urine drug screening and consulting

the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program;
