(Resp. Ex. 3). Dr RE forthe concluded:

 

(Ud.). As previously stated, I agree with Dr. i= the neurological tests which are
focused on cognitive ability bear more relevance to my determination than repeat mini mental
exams. I also consider that Dr as not testify at the hearing to explain the basis for the
conclusions reached and the reasons why further testing was not recommended, and did not
express an opinion of the Respondent’s competence to practice medicine,

: Dr sia provide an opinion on the Respondent’s competence to practice medicine.
He administered tests for the purpose of rendering an opinion in this case and opined that the
Respondent was “cognitively” competent to practice medicine. As already stated, on the issue of
cognitive testing, I have assigned more weight to Dr. S| testimony than to Dr. za
‘testimony. I do not believe that the limited tests upon which Dr. ics in rendering his
opinion are sufficient to make a proper determination. I also do not find these results to support

a conclusion that the Respondent is competent to practice medicine. Accordingly, I do not credit

Dr. Be orision on this issue.
