she knew what kind of surgery she was having.

67. After the Respondent interacted with Individual 10 in the pre-op room and the
anesthesia consent was signed, Individual 10 received the medication Midazolam, whose trade
name is Versed. Versed can produce amnesia. Individual 10 had not yet been administered the
Versed when she saw the Respondent or when she signed the anesthesia consent. She received
Versed either in the pre-op room after the interaction with the Respondent or on the way to the OR
or in the OR.

68. The cyst removal surgery was performed, after which Individual 10 was taken to
the recovery room. Her pain had vanished, but she was unable to stand. The Respondent was
called and said the nerve was angry but that would go away.

69. Individual 10 was discharged the same day, March 29, 2017.

70. Ina post-operative follow-up telephone call from a person at the Hospital, on March
30, 2017, Individual 10 rated her “overall experience” at the Hospital as “Excellent.”

71. On March 31, 2017, Individual 10 returned to the Hospital, where the Respondent
performed a second surgery. The reason for the second surgery was that, after the first surgery,
Individual 10’s pain continued to worsen when she stood and she had trouble walking from the
pain. On March 31, 2017, the date of the second surgery, Individual 10 asked the Respondent if
her former fiancé, a Medtronic representative, would be present during the operation. She asked
because the second operation involved the placement of screws and a tod to stabilize her back.
Individual 10’s first surgery did not involve screws and a rod, it involved only the removal of the

synovial cyst.
