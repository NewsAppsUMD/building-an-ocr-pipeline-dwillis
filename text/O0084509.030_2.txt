Hospital for “personal reasons.”
Based on the Respondent’s affirmative response to the character and fitness
questions, the Board opened an investigation.

BOARD INVESTIGATION
On or about July 15, 2019, Board staff sent a subpoena to the Hospital for the
Respondent’s complete personnel file, which the Board received on or about
July 30, 2019.
A review of the Respondent’s personnel file revealed that, on March 26, 2019,
the Respondent’s supervisor (the “Supervisor”) was informed by another staff
member that the Respondent was “nodding off at the treatment console and
slurring her words.” At this point the Supervisor sent the Respondent to have a
Fitness-for-Duty (“FFD”) evaluation based on these observations as well as
previous instances of similar conduct. The Supervisor noted that the Respondent
also nodded off during a staff meeting one day during the previous month, and
on another occasion had been observed “stumbling around and being clumsy and

dropping things.”
