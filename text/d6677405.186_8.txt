The Respondent ordered MRIs of Patient 2â€™s cervical and thoracic spine and x-
rays of her coccyx and lumbosacral spine.

Patient 2 then told the Respondent that she also had pain in her foot. The
Respondent entered some information on the computer in the exam room and
advised Patient 2 that he could not do anything about her foot pain. He referred
her for a podiatric consultation. He also prescribed prednisone, a corticosteroid
medication.

As the Respondent continued to enter information on the computer, someone
knocked on the closed examination room door and told the Respondent that he
was needed elsewhere. The Respondent replied that he was with a patient and
was almost finished.

The Respondent, who was seated on a rolling stool, instructed Patient 2 to
approach him. He positioned Patient 2 between his legs and instructed her to
pull down her pants. The Respondent put on a glove and once again inserted his
finger in her anus, this time further than the first insertion.

After removing his finger, the Respondent rose and washed his hands, repeating
to Patient 2 that he did not think that she had a broken bone.

At no time did the Respondent explain to Patient 2 the reason why he inserted
his finger in her anus on two occasions.

Patient 2 felt very uncomfortable after the Respondent had touched her and ran

to the bathroom to clean herself.
