record, indicates that the Respondent has failed to meet the standards of care in his treatment of
these ten patients.
Patient A

Patient A first visited the Respondent on October 19, 2012. He complained of back pain
and insomnia. He was first given Motrin but returned to the office claiming that it did not
alleviate the pain and made him nauseous, Patient A mentioned that the only thing that worked
for him was low dosages of Percocet (oxycodone). While this did raise a red flag to the
Respondent, he prescribed the medication anyway. The Respondent knew that Patient A had
been incarcerated and may have had a connection with a gang due to a tattoo that was a symbol
of a prominent gang. Although x-rays were taken, Dr, Wright indicated in her testimony that the
x-rays of Patient A were essentially normal. Furthermore, a MRI was not ordered that would
have likely identified the source of the pain so that it could be treated either surgically or through
other modalities such as physical therapy.

The Respondent deemed i it a success that Patient A was able to return to employment
driving a tow truck. The Respondent failed to mention that Patient A lost his job driving a tow
truck when he crashed two cars, (Tr. 237), The fact that he was involved in several accidents
while on opioids suggests that the drug may have been a contributing factor in these two crashes.
Patient A also complained of anxiety during all of his visits to the Respondent. The Respondent
prescribed Xanax for the anxiety. During the entire time that Patient A was a patient of the
Respondent, the Respondent did not order random drug screens, random pill counts, or
psychological screening to determine if he was diverting or abusing the medications. Patient A

was prescribed, in addition to Percocet and Xanax, Navane (antipsychotic) and Ambien. Patient
