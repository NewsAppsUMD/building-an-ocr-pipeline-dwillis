The pertinent provisions of the Board's regulations, Md. Code Regs. 10.32.02.14
provide:

.14 Proposed Orders; ...

A. Nothing in this chapter prohibits the issuance of a charging
document with a proposed order which will go into effect if the
respondent fails to request a hearing.

FINDINGS OF FACT
Panel A finds the following:

1. At all times relevant hereto, the Respondent was and is licensed to
practice radiography in the State of Maryland. The Respondent was initially licensed to
practice radiography in Maryland on July 27, 2016, under License Number R11742. The
Respondent's license is currently active and is scheduled for renewal on April 30, 2019.

2. On or about April 6, 2017, the Respondent initiated the process of
applying for renewal of her radiography license for the 2017 renewal period using the
Boardâ€™s online renewal application process. When a licensee applies online to renew
his/her license, a notice appears that informs the licensee that the Board may not renew
a license if it has not received the licensee's Criminal History Record Check ("CHRC")
information, which includes the licensee's submission of his/her fingerprints to the
Criminal Justice Information Services ("CJIS") before attempting to complete the
renewal application.

3, The Respondent submitted her online application (the "Application") on or
about April 6, 2017, along with the required renewal fee. The Application the
Respondent signed states, "Failure to submit to a... [CHRC] .. . may result in
disciplinary action." When submitting her online Application, the Respondent checked a
box attesting that she completed her CHRC.
