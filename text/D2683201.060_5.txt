conspiracy to commit Medicaid fraud is also a crime involving moral turpitude per se. See, e.g.,
Attorney Grievance Comm'n of Maryland v, Molovinsky, 300 Md, 291, 296 (1984) (the fact “that
the conviction was for conspiracy rather than the substantive offense is of little significance”),

Dr, Shaw-Taylor knowingly and willfully defrauded Medicaid and prescribed controlled
dangerous substances outside the scope of professional practice and without a legitimate medical
purpose. Panel B concludes that Dr. Shaw-Taylor was convicted of a crime involving moral
turpitude and the time for filing an appeal has passed, thus the revocation of Dr, Shaw-Taylor’s
license to practice medicine is required under Health Occ, § 14-404(b)(2),

ORDER

It is, on the affirmative vote of a majority of the quorum of Disciplinary Panel B, hereby

ORDERED that the license of Kofi Shaw-Taylor, M.D. to practice medicine in
Maryland, license number D26832, is REVOKED, as mandated by Health Occ. §14-404(b)(2);
and it is further

ORDERED that the summary suspension imposed on May 9, 2017, and affirmed on
June 29, 2017, is terminated as moot; and it is further

ORDERED that this final decision and order is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT.
