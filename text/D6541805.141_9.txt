2. Health Oce. § 14-404(a)(3) (1s guilty of: (i) Immoral conduct in the practice of
medicine; or (ii) Unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine);

3. Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(4) (Is professionally, physically, or mentally
incompetent);

4, Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(11) (Willfully makes or files a false report in the practice

The Respondent filed Exceptions, but he did not take exception to the ALJ’s Proposed
Conclusions of Law that he violated Health Occ, § 14-404(a)(2), (3), (11), and (36). The
Respondent, however, seems to have intended to take exception to the ALJ’s Proposed
Conclusions of Law that he violated Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(4), (17), and (27).

The Respondent did not contest the Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(2), (3), (11), or (36) charges

irresponsible prescribing practices.” (Charges at page 8). It does not appear the Respondent has
contested this Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3) charge related to his prescribing practices. Based upon
the State’s expert’s review of the relevant documents, the State’s expert’s opinion, concerning the
Respondent's prescribing, is that the Respondent is guilty of unprofessional conduct in the practice
of medicine. The Panel accepts this opinion and finds that the evidence related to his egregious
prescribing practices, discussed and described in this decision, proves a violation of Health Occ. §
14-404(a)(3).
