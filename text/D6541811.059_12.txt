 

4, At all relevant times, the Respondent held a permit to dispense certain drugs,
including CDS, from his practice.

5. Under Maryland law, the Respondent was authorized to dispense prescription
drugs to his patients at the location of his practice as long as he maintained forms which
contained the following information: a statement indicating a pharmacy was not conveniently
available to the patient; a statement indicating that the determination a pharmacy was not
conveniently available was made solely by the patient; and the patient’s signature and the date.
The form was to be signed by the patient prior to the first time any prescription drugs were
dispensed by the Respondent to the patient.

6. As part of his weight loss practice, the Respondent had access to phentermine and
phendimetrazine, both of which are appetite suppressants and CDS.

7, In his weight loss practice, the Respondent got into the habit of dispensing
prescription drugs to patients who did not have insurance and writing prescriptions for patients
who possessed health insurance.

8. The Respondent had multiple weight loss patients who were unwilling to allow
him to weigh them when they came to their appointments. As a result, the Respondent was often
unable to document their weight gain or loss in their charts.

9. In or around November 2017, and as a result of the difficulty he had with getting
his weight loss patients to cooperate with certain aspects of treatment (including allowing him to
weigh them) and the poor economic benefits of a weight loss practice in the Respondent’s
geographic area, the Respondent wound down and terminated his weight loss practice.

10. Once the Respondent closed the weight loss portion of his medical practice, he

stopped dispensing prescription drugs at the practice location.
