The Board recommended that the Respondent serve a thirty-day — euspendted :
pending completion of the following tems: 1) Within six months, pay a civil fine of $25,000.00:
2) Be placed on ee for three years; 3) Within six months, complete a course in ethics and
a — in professional boundaries; 4) Within fifteen days, water see a participant rehabilitation
aqreenent and plan with the Maryland Physician Rehabilitation — and comply with all of
the program’s rules, referrals and recommendations; and 4) Sign all disclosures necessary to
allow the Board to monitor his participation.

I found the Board’s recommendations to be mostly reasonable and appropriate for the
Respondent’s violations. A deferred suspension aud probationary period are reasonable so that

the Board can ensure that the Respondent is rehabilitated through participation in the

" recommended courses and participation in the Physician’s Rehabilitation Program. The

Respondent engaged in behavior that he knew to be in violation of the Act, in favor of his own

‘interest and desires, There is nothing in the record before me to indicate that the Respondent has

done anything to rehabilitate these behaviors. However, regarding the fine, the State did not
explain its rationale or provide any breakdown of its recommended $25,000.00. While this fine |
is within the range allowed for his violations, I found it to be high under the circumstances. The

Respondent did not cause any public harm. He has never been disciplined previously.

- Nevertheless, I conclude that a fine is warranted to deter the Respondent from ever engaging in

this behavior again, and because his behaviors damaged the integrity of the profession. I

recommend that the Board impose a fine of $15,000.00.

? The minimum fine for this violation is $10,000.00 and the maximum is $50.000.00. COMAR 10.32.02,10B(3)(b).
