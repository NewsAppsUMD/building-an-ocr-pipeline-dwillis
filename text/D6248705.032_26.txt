notes he provided in response to the Board’s subpoena, he said he wasn’t sure and that “[his]
memory is wiped.” According to Dr. Schnitzlein, he could not recall details about his treatment or
personal contact with the patient after her discharge and did not remember the content of his text
messages with her. When shown copies of the specific text messages, including heart emojis and
references to baths, he stated: “Good question; don’t know.” In response to a question about any
intimate contact with the patient, he answered: “I can’t because its wiped from my memory.” When
questioned about text messages that may have had sexual innuendo, Dr. Schnitzlein said that he
would have sent such messages to the patient for “her therapy.” He stated that he was trying to

admitted calling the patient in August 2019 and leaving her voicemails but could not recall what
he said.
