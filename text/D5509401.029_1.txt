Il. THE COMPLAINT

4. The Board initiated an investigation of the Respondent after receiving a
complaint, dated June 15, 2018, from a physician assistant (the “Complainant”)? who
practiced at an urgent care facility (the “Facility’) in the District of Columbia. The
Complainant reported that on June 15, 2018, the Respondent entered the Facility at
11:00 a.m. and slept in the Facility’s waiting room until 1:00 p.m., when medical
assistants there tried to rouse him, without success. The medical assistants asked the
Complainant to try to wake up the Respondent. The Complainant administered a
sternal rub to the Respondent, who continued snoring through the procedure. The
Complainant shook the Respondent, who briefly woke up. The Complainant informed
the Respondent that he had to complete paperwork and be seen or the Facility might be
forced to transport him to the emergency room for further evaluation. The Respondent
agreed but then fell asleep again briefly. The Complainant was forced to wake up the

Respondent again.

2 For confidentiality reasons, the names/identities of the Complainant, medical facilities and other
