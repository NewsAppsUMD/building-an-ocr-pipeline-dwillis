include Dr. Williams’s understanding of the nature of his violations, and his acceptance of
responsibility for these violations. Ifa disciplinary panel chooses not to reinstate the petitioner’ s
license, the. “disciplinary panel decision denying reinstatement may set out when, if ever, a
subsequent petition may be submitted.” COMAR 10.32.02.06B(8) (emphasis added),

As an-initial matter, the Panel notes the serious nature of Dr. Williams’s conduct and the
harm he caused to his patients. When revoking Dr. Williams’ license, the Panel explained that
he committed sexual violations against four patients and in doing so abused his professional
status and breached the trust his patients placed in him. Dr. Williams placed his fingers in a
patient’s anus, and in another patient’s vagina, and brushed his finger across another patient’s
clitoris. His conduct caused his patients significant distress. The State’s policy focus is
protecting the health, safety, and welfare of the public, as memorialized in Health Occ, § 1-
102(a), and thus the Panel must take into account that he exhibited a pattern of sexual abuse,
directly harming his patients.

Moreover, Panel A finds that Dr. Williams has not genuinely accepted responsibility for
his actions. His response to the Board’s follow-up questions did not acknowledge any
wrongdoing or specify any concerns other than a generic discussion about professionalism. In
responding to the specific question about his termination from employment, Dr. Williams
continues to deny that he did anything wrong, claiming that he was not advised that he needed a
chaperone present during his evaluations.

Though he states that he accepts responsibility for his actions, Dr. Williams’s failure to
acknowledge any misconduct does not instill confidence that he has sincerely taken

responsibility for his actions.
