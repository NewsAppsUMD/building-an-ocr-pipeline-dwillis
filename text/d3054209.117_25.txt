 

I find S.B.’s account of what occurred on February 22, 2016 to be credible and not
exaggerated. According to S.B., she had been to the Respondent’s office with clients on two
- occasions prior to February 22, 2016. There is no evidence of any histoty between the two of
them that indicates S.B. has a bias against the Respondent or any motive to falsely accuse him of
wrongdoing fi is S.B.’s supervisor iim corroborated.
S.B.’s testimony that the Respondent pushed her and pushed a wheelchair into her legs.
According to Mr. a: B. called him on February 22, 2016, in tears, and advised him (1)
someone needed to come retrieve Patient B from the Respondent’s office, and (2) the
_ Respondent pushed her and-hit her with a wheelchair. (Tr., p. 132.)
Contrary to the Respondent’s argument that S.B. is the only person who testified about
the whestchsis, Mc MMM bors S.B. on this point, and he indicated she made the
‘report to him contemporaneously with the incident. Critically, ves a favorable
history with the Respondent; the Respondent used to be his physician. That Mr. F |
despite a favorable history with the Respondent, nevertheless provided negative testimony about
the Respondent, lends credibility to S.B.’s assertion the Respondent pushed her and struck her
. with a wheelchair. I give more weight to the testimony of S.B. and Mr. an I do to
either the Respondent fT... both claimed the Respondent never touched S.B. in
any manner. The Respondent has a vested interest in downplaying the negative aspects of his
interactions with S.B. ws: the Respondent’s longtime employee! and, therefore, likely
has a favorable bias towards the Respondent. I find it more likely than not that the Respondent
pushed S.B. in the shoulder and pushed the wheelchair into S.B. while in the process of yelling at

"ber to get out of his office.
