her next visit, which was scheduled for October 2015. Patient A experienced continuing
distress from the Respondent’s behavior and overtures toward her.

9. During its investigation into the Respondent's actions toward Patient A, the
Board reviewed a prior complaint it closed through a non-public Advisory Letter, dated
November 28, 2012. The Advisory Letter stated that if additional allegations of a similar
nature arose, the Board would reopen this investigation.

10. This complaint was filed by an adult female ("Patient B") who, for a period
of time, was in treatment with a physician with whom the Respondent was professionally
affiliated. When Patient B was unable to obtain an appointment from the Respondent's
professional associate, she saw the Respondent in 2011 on two Office visits, primarily for
medication refills. During the first visit, the Respondent made inappropriate personal
remarks to Patient B. During the second visit, the Respondent again made sexually
oriented remarks to Patient B, touched her on the shoulders in a non-clinical manner,
requested to meet her for a social purpose, and hugged and kissed her, which made her
feel very uncomfortable. Because of the Respondent's actions, Patient B decided not to
see him further for treatment. Patient B was re-interviewed by Board investigators and
reaffirmed the statements she made in her complaint.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Panel A concludes as a matter of law
