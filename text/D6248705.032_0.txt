Re: — Surrender of License to Practice Medicine
Robert Schnitzlein, M.D.
License Number: D62487
Case Number: 7722-0045

Dear Dr. Freas and Members of Disciplinary Panel B:

Please be advised that, pursuant to Md, Code Ann., Health Occ. (“Health Occ.”)
§14-403 (2021 Repl. Vol.), I have decided to SURRENDER my license to practice
medicine in the State of Maryland, License Number D62487, effective immediately. |
understand that upon surrender of my license, I may not practice medicine, with or
without compensation, in the State of Maryland as it is defined in the Maryland Medical
Practice Act (the “Act”), Health Occ. §§ 14-101 et seq. and other applicable laws. In
other words, as of the effective date of this Letter of Surrender, I understand that the
surrender of my license means that I am in the same position as an unlicensed individual
in the State of Maryland.

I understand that this Letter of Surrender is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT, and upon
Disciplinary Panel B’s (“Panel B”) acceptance, becomes a FINAL ORDER of Panel B
of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”).

I acknowledge that the Board summarily suspended my license to practice
medicine on January 14, 2020 based on concerns about my ability to practice safely. On
February 5, 2020, Panel B charged me with violating Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(i) and
(ii) and with violating the Board’s sexual misconduct regulations, COMAR 10.32.17. I
resolved these disciplinary charges through a Consent Order with Panel B, dated May 20,
2020, that terminated the summary suspension, suspended my license for a minimum of
one (1) year, reprimanded me, and required that I comply with certain terms and
conditions during the suspension. A copy of the Consent Order is attached and
incorporated herein as Attachment 1.

On November 19, 2021, the Board issued an Order On Petition to Terminate
Suspension of Medical License that denied my petition to terminate the suspension
