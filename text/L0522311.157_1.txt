NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, you have the right to request a full evidentiary hearing
before an Administrative Law Judge. This request will be granted if the Board receives a written
request for the hearing within TEN (10) days of the date of this letter. Any request for a hearing
should be sent to Christine Farrelly, Executive Director, at the Board’s address. If such a hearing
is requested, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set the hearing to begin
within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08 I, though that 30-day requirement may
be waived.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel A resulting from

formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely yours,
i
