ORDER AFTER SHOW CAUSE HEARING
Introduction

The issue in this case is whether Andrea N. Bailey, M.D. (“Dr. Bailey”) has violated the
conditions of the Consent Order executed on August 25, 2016 (“2016 Consent Order”) by the
Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”). The Consent Order required Dr. Bailey to
enroll in the Maryland Professional Rehabilitation Program (“MPRP”), and to comply with the
requirements of any MPRP Rehabilitation Agreement and Rehabilitation Plan. Disciplinary
Panel B (‘Panel B”) of the Board is issuing this order after consideration of the presentations
made by the State and Dr. Bailey at the show cause hearing held on September 27, 2017. Dr.
Bailey admitted that she self-prescribed and refilled medications under a fictitious name while
enrolled in MPRP, conduct that violated her MPRP Rehabilitation Agreement and the 2016

Consent Order, and for which she was terminated for cause from the program on June 12, 2017.

FINDINGS OF FACT

Licensure, Professional, and Employment Background
Dr. Bailey was originally licensed by the Board in 1993. Following the expiration of her
license in 2009, Dr. Bailey submitted an application for reinstatement in October 2014, and the
Board reinstated her license in December 2014. Dr. Bailey has also held medical licenses in New
York and Virginia. Dr. Bailey does not hold any hospital privileges and is not board-certified by

the American Board of Medical Specialties. Pediatrics is her self-reported area of specialization.
