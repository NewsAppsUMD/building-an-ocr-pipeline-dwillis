paperwork that had the wrong name on it, he prescribed a medication that she was
allergic to, and the medication prescribed did not address the reason for her visit.°

Assistant made the decision to alert the RMD of the Respondent’s concerning behavior.

longer permitted to see patients, he sat at his desk for the rest of the day and slept. The

CRNP explained that

wake up and pull a patient — almost like he forgot he wasn’t
supposed to take the patient . . . I think that happened twice, and I
spoke to my manager, I said, you know, he took another patient. And
[the RMD] called him right away, told him not to see that patient...
So I took the patient.

the Center:
