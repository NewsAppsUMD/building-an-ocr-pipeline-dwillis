 

daughter nor Friend 1 took Patient 4’s complaints about the Respondent seriously. (Test. Patient
4 at 419; Test. Friend 1 at 472-74; State’s Ex, 12 at 53-54.)

140. On July 24, 2014, Patient 4 returned to me. to have the
Respondent perform an epidural steroid injection in her cervical spine. Because of ber prior
experience with the Respondent, Patient 4 returned to the Respondent with some reluctance. She
ultimately decided to allow him to give her an epidural steroid injection because she wanted
relief from her back pain. (Test. Patient 4; T. at 415, 420; State’s Ex. 46 at 001619.)

141. On July 24, 2014, a nurse assisted the Respondent when he performed the ,
epidural steroid injection in Patient 4’s cervical spine. That procedure went forward without
incident. (Test. Patient 4; T. at 416, 422; State’s Ex. 46 at 001002001005.)

142. Onor about April 12, 2016, Friend 1 called Patient 4 to tell her that the Channel
9 news”! was reporting that the Respondent had been brought up on charges for molesting his
patients. Patient 4 performed an Internet search using Google to verify that the Respondent was,
in fact, the physician brought up on these charges. (Test. Patient 4, T. at 424-26, 433-34.)

143, Patient 4 located an article on the Internet that described the charges that the
Board had filed against the Respondent up to that time; that article also provided the telephone
number of Administrative Prosecutor Victoria Pepper. Remembering her experience from 2014
and believing that that the way the Respondent performed the caudal steroid injection in between
her buttocks on May 8, 2014 constituted possible misconduct by him, Patient 4 left a message for
Ms. Pepper. She left that message because it was after business hours and all State offices were

closed. (Test. Patient 4, T. at 425-26.)

?° According to Patient 4, her original attempt at submitting her complaint by facsimile failed, and Board
Investigator Doreen Noppinger asked her to resubmit it by scanning it and then sending it. Ms. Noppinger was
responding to the telephone message that Patient 4 left for Ms. Pepper. (Test. Patient 4, T. at 426.) Therefore, Patient
4 surmised that she most likely received the call from Friend 1 on April 12, 2016. (Test. Patient 4, T. at 433.)

*! Friend 1 identified Fox 5 as the television station that broadcast the news report about the Respondent’s alleged
misconduct. (Test. Friend 1, T. at 475.)
