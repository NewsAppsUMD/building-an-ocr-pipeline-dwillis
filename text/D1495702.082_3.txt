investigation and subpoenaed Patient B’s medical records. After completing the investigation,

EXCEPTIONS

Dr. Smith raises five arguments in his exceptions. Dr. Smith argues that: (1) the State did
not provide adequate notice of the allegations against him; (2) the AMA Opinion 8.19 does not
prohibit prescribing to family members in situations such as this; (3) Patient B was a former
patient and there is no prohibition on sexual relationships with former patients; (4) he did not
mislead the Board when he answered that he had not had a sexual relationship with patients
whom he was treating; and (5) the Program deemed him fit to practice, so the Board should
allow him to continue to practice medicine.

1. The State’s Notice was Adequate.

Dr. Smith first argues that the State failed to give sufficient notice of the allegations
against him prior to the hearing. Dr. Smith states that at the OAH hearing, the State referenced
“unrelated prior interactions with the Board that did not result in charges.” Dr. Smith does not
specifically describe what interactions he is referring to, but the State’s response explains that he
appears to be referring to the State’s expert’s testimony about two instances where Dr. Smith was
investigated and received advisory letters, but was not charged with violating the Medical
Practice Act. Dr. Smith also argues that he was not given sufficient notice related to his
treatment of Patient B’s husband while he was having a sexual relationship with Patient B.’

First, Dr. Smith has waived these arguments because he did not object to the discussion
of the advisory letters or his treatment of Patient B’s husband at OAH. “Ifa party fails to object,

> The State did not raise this issue in its case in chief, rather this was information provided by Dr. Smith
during cross-examination by the State.
