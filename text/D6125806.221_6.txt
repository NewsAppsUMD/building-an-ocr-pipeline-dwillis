“reeled in” by Dr. Singhal. Finally, the State argues that Dr. Singhal had discussions with
Patient | about Patient 1’s sex with his wife.

Patient 1’s inconsistent statements

First, the Panel finds that the inconsistencies in Patient 1’s testimony were generally
either insignificant differences or based on Patient 1°s speculation rather than dishonesty. In
contrast, Dr. Singhal consistently was dishonest, downplaying his wrongdoing and fabricating
mitigating conduct. Only when it was revealed that his testimony would be contradicted did Dr.
Singhal testify truthfully.

The ALJ notes that Patient 1’s complaint stated that the sexual relationship began while
he was a patient, but he later acknowledged that it did not. The ALJ, thus, concludes that Patient
1 was embellishing the details in his complaint. However, based on its evaluation of Patient 1's
interview with the Board, the Panel finds that Patient 1’s inconsistent statements about whether
the treatment and sexual relationship overlapped stem not from dishonesty or embellishment, but
rather Patient 1’s uncertainty as to when his wife’s sexual relationship with Dr. Singhal began.
In his interview with the Board, Patient 1 stated both that the sexual relationship began in June
2016, which was after his treatment ended, and also that Dr. Singhal visited him to show off his
car while he was a patient and when the sexual relationship had already begun. These
inconsistencies reflect Patient {’s lack of memory of when Dr. Singhal visited his house and
when the sexual relationship started rather than Patient 1’s intent to mislead the Board. Patient
1's error is understandable. He did not know about the sexual relationship between Dr. Singhal
and his wife until a year and a half after it began, and only found out about the details of the

relationship second-hand from his wife, which explains his imprecise statements to the Board.
