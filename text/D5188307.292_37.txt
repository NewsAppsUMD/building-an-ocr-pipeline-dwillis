Sanctions

The purpose of imposing sanctions under section 14-404 of the Maryland Medical
Practices Act is not to punish, but rather to protect. As the Court of Appeals of Maryland
explained in McDonnell v. Comm'n on Medical Discipline:

The purpose of disciplinary proceedings against licensed professionals is

not to punish the offender but rather as a catharsis for the profession. and a

prophylactic for the public. See Maryland St, Bar Ass’n v. Agnew, 271 Md. 543,

318 A.2d 811 (1974); Bar Ass’n v. Marshall, 269 Md..510, 307 A.2d 677 (1973).

See also Unnamed Physician v. Comm'n, 285 Mad. 1, 400 A.2d 396 (1979),

quoting In re Kindschi, 52 Wash.2d 8, 319 P.2d 824 (1958).

301 Md. 426, 436 (1984) (emphasis added). ,

rehabilitative conditions as a part of the sanction. Health Occ. §14-404(e); COMAR
10,32.02.09A(5).

The Board has promulgated a sanctioning matrix to guide it ih the consideration of the
appropriate sanction and any fine. COMAR 10,32.02.10; see also COMAR 10.32.02.09. Upon
consideration of aggravating and mitigating factors, the sanction ultimately imposed by the

_ Board may depart from the guidelines. COMAR 10.32.02.09A(8), (9), B.

Under the guidelines, the sanction for a physician who is guilty of unprofessional conduct

in the practice of medicine, consisting of non-sexual ethical violations, ranges from a minimum

sanction of a reprimand to a maximum sanction of revocation. The fine ranges from a minimum
