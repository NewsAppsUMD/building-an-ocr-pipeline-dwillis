Terri Welter testified on behalf of Dr. MacKoul. She is a management consultant for the
healthcare industry who assists with managed care contract negotiations and deals between
providers and payors. According to Ms. Welter, billing codes in the thirty-thousands were
generally used for cardiac procedures. A CPT code .in the fifty-thousands were used for OB/GYN
procedures. She stated that Dr. MacKoul was explicitly allowed to use CPT 37617 based on his
fee schedule contracts with payors. She understood that Dr. MacKoul’s procedures were complex
cases with large fibroid tumors that required ligation of the artery and were performed “in a
separate space.” In her opinion, this was not “unbundling”, rather, the ligation was a separate
procedure from the hysterectomy that was performed only because of the complexity of the
hysterectomy,

Dr. MacKoul acknowledges that CPT 37617 is not a common gynecologic code, but states
that he had negotiated it as one of the fees that the insurers would pay for. He noted that the
insurers reimbursed for this code, sometimes at levels higher than the hysterectomy itself. He also
represented that he takes out very large uteri, up to 5,000 to 7,000 grams, and that his procedure,
even with the additional billing code is still cost effective compared to a robotic procedure.

The ALJ framed the issue as whether Dr. MacKoul’s contract with CareFirst authorized
him to bill CPT 37617 in addition to the general hysterectomy code and, if so, whether it was
appropriate under the contract. Noting that the size of a regular uterus is 70 grams, and that the
patients’ uteri were: 43.9, 150, 155, 184, 459, and 620 grams, the ALJ found that, except for one,
these uteri were all double the size of a normal sized uterus. The ALJ concluded that Dr.
MacKoul’s billing was appropriate and regardless was a contractual dispute with CareFirst and

recommended dismissal of the charges related to this issue.
