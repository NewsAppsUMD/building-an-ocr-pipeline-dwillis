 

7. Upon the Respondent’s arrival, Facility staff members observed the
Respondent to be disheveled with the bottom of his pant leg tucked into his sock, his hair
unkempt and his shirt stained with deodorant. Facility staff members noticed the
Respondent’s speech was disjointed and slow. The Respondent proceeded to perform the
scheduled procedure and was observed to be “hyperfocused on each step of the procedure,
as if he was trying to remember what was to come next.” The Respondent performed the
procedure without any issues, but a Facility staff observed him to be rude when speaking
with the patient.

8. The Facility administrative staff decided not to allow the Respondent to
perform anymore procedures after the first patient. While Facility staff members were
speaking with the Respondent about his behavior in a consulting room, the Respondent
began retching and vomiting.

9. At approximately 1:00 p.m., the Respondent was driven by a Facility staff
member to another health care facility where he submitted a blood test for toxicology
screening. The result of the toxicology screening indicated that the Respondent was
impaired with an elevated blood alcohol content.

10. On or about October 20, 2023, the Respondent submitted a written response
to the Board in which he admitted to drinking more alcohol than he thought the night before
the stated incident on August 28, 2023, and also admitted that his blood alcohol level was

elevated on that date.
