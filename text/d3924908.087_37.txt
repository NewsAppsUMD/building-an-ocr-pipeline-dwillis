in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(19); failed to meet the appropriate standards as

determined by appropriate peer review for the delivery of quality medical care performed in this

State, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(22); and failed to keep adequate medical records as

determined by appropriate peer review, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(40).
SANCTION

The ALJ recommended the revocation of the Respondent’s license. The ALJ found that
the Respondent’s over-billing was deliberate and included billing for testing he did not perform.
The ALJ also emphasized that his over-billing was not isolated and that he made no efforts to
rectify it. According to the ALJ, his “offenses were part of a pattern of detrimental conduct.”

The Respondent filed an exception to the ALJ’s recommended sanction. The Respondent
states that the Respondent has no prior disciplinary history and that “no patient was harmed.”
The Respondent argues he has rehabilitative potential and his conduct “was not committed in the
deliberate fashion with which the ALJ concluded.” The Respondent claims that his poor
recordkeeping skills “undeniably contributed to the ALJ’s finding of deliberate conduct.” The
Respondent contends that his practice could improve through a comprehensive recordkeeping
course and a supervisor for his billing and medical records. The Panel finds this inadequate.

The Panel finds the Respondent’s practices disturbing and intolerable. Certainly, the
Respondent’s over-billing was not isolated. It consumed his practice. His practice was replete
with different schemes to bill for services that were not performed and for services that were
performed but not indicated. And there is no doubt his conduct was deliberate. The Panel also
finds unacceptable the number of inaccurate, contradictory, and false documents he produced.

The Panel agrees with the ALJ that revocation is appropriate.
