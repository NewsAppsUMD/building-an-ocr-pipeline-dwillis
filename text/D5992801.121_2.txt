 

is licensed to practice medicine in Maryland, board-certified in otolaryngology, and the
Section Chief of Otolaryngology at a university-operated hospital, reviewed six records of
patients whom the Respondent treated at the Hospital. Physician A noted quality of care
concerns with five out of six records he reviewed and summarized his findings as follows:

All of the poor surgical outcomes with these cases are worrisome
individually but together are very troubling. Overall, it’s my opinion
{the Respondent] is not technically competent to perform these
surgeries. He doesn’t seem to have kept up or been adequately trained
in new technology and new surgical techniques which were available
for him to use in the operating room for these cases. These cases are
extremely concerning and I think patients are in imminent danger and
it’s unsafe for him to continue to operate.

8. On or about June 16, 2020, Board staff discussed the external peer review
report with Physician A. He confirmed his comments and concerns included in the peer
review report that he previously submitted to the Hospital. Physician A also opined that
the Respondent is not technically competent to perform surgeries on the upper airway such
as tonsillectomy or any nasal or sinus surgery that needed to be done under sedation.

9. On or about July 23, 2020, at the direction of a Board-approved program, the
Respondent underwent an independent evaluation to determine his present fitness to safely
practice medicine. On or about August 24, 2020, the Board received the report from the
Evaluator. Based on his comprehensive testing and evaluation, the Evaluator concurred
with Physician A’s earlier opinion that the Respondent “cannot safely perform the types of
operations that resulted in poor surgical outcomes.” The Evaluator recommended further

testing be done to determine the underlying cause of the Respondent’s present condition.
