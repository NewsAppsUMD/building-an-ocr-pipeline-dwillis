On July 11, 2017, Patient C had a “meet and greet” with the Respondent
at the Practice. Patient C complained that she was having pain in her liver,
and that she was not getting any relief from Tramadol or ibuprofen. The
Respondent prescribed oxycodone and ordered an x-ray.

On or about October 3, 2017, the Respondent called Patient C and stated
that he wanted to stop by with another order for an x-ray. The Respondent
then asked her if she had picked up her order for oxycodone. After Patient
C told him that she had not picked up the prescription, the Respondent
said that he would drop off the order for the x-ray on another day.
Toxicology Screening Results

The Respondent was subpoenaed to the Board for an interview on March
7, 2018. The Subpoena required the Respondent to appear at the Board
and give testimony in the form of an interview. The Respondent arrived at
the Board with counsel, but he refused to answer any questions under
oath. The Respondent's counsel advised him not to respond to the

interview questions.

After the March 7th meeting with the Board, the Respondent went for a
toxicology screen per the Board's instructions. The results of the screening
indicated that the Respondent tested positive for opiates and various

opioid medications.
