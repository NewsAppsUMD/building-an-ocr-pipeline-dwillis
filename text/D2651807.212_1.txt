FINDINGS OF FACT
Panel B finds the following:
Background/Licensing Information
1. The Respondent was originally issued a license to practice medicine in Maryland on
June 17, 1981, under License Number D26518. The Respondent has retained
continuous licensure in Maryland since that time. The Respondent’s license expires on

September 30, 2022, subject to renewal.
2. The Respondent is board-certified in pediatric medicine and dermatology.

3. At all relevant times, the Respondent practiced at a health care facility (the “Facility”)

in Maryland.

The Complaint
4. The Board initiated an investigation of the Respondent after reviewing a Mandated
10-Day Report (the “Report’”’) from the Facility, received by the Board on September 21,
2021. The Report stated that effective September 3, 2021, the Respondent “voluntarily
resigned his medical staff membership and clinical privileges at [the Facility] while under
investigation for concerns raised that he continued to engage in clinical practice while on

a medical leave of absence.”

Board Investigation
5. As part of its investigation, the Board obtained the Respondent’s quality assurance
file from the Facility, interviewed several staff members from the Facility, and referred the

Respondent for an evaluation.
