Before this Panel, Dr. Williams stated that he would use a chaperone to protect himself
from further accusations, but he did not express any sympathy towards the patients whom he
harmed. The Board’s Order revoking his license noted significant aftereffects of patients who
were sexually abused by Dr. Williams. For instance, Patient 2 suffered from night terrors and
sought psychiatric treatment to deal with her trauma based on Dr. William’s conduct. And
Patient 5 sought sexual assault counseling on a weekly basis. Dr. Williams’s responses are not
sufficient to assure the Panel that his conduct would not be repeated.

In the ALJ’s proposed decision, on the adjudication of the charges, the ALJ
recommended a permanent revocation of Dr. Williams’s license. The Panel, instead, simply
revoked his license, without any restriction on reapplying to practice medicine. Having
considered all of the foregoing information, the Panel concludes that Dr. Williams has not
satisfied the Panel that he is fit to return to the practice of medicine, reinstatement is not in the
interest of the health and welfare of the general public, and reinstatement would not be consistent
with the best interest of the profession. The Panel has no confidence that Dr. Williams will ever
be safe to practice in this State again. The Panel will, therefore, deny his application for

reinstatement and will not permit him to reapply.
