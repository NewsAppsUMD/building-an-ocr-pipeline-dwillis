Prior disciplinary history

4. On or about February 4, 2014, the Board charged the Respondent with
violating disciplinary provisions under the Act after its investigation determined that he
inappropriately prescribed high doses of opioid medications to patients without appropriate
justification or monitoring. The investigation also determined that the Respondent was
guilty of unprofessional conduct with respect to his storage of medical records and
conditions in his office.

5. The Respondent resolved the Board’s charges by entering into a Consent
Order, dated April 29, 2014, in which the Board found as a matter of law that the
Respondent violated the following provisions of the Act under Health Occ. § 14-
404(a): (3) Is guilty of: (ii) Unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine; (22) Fails
to meet appropriate standards as determined by appropriate peer review for the delivery of
quality medical and surgical care performed in an outpatient surgical facility, office,
hospital, or any other location in this State; and (40) Fails to keep adequate medical records
as determined by appropriate peer review.

6. Under the Consent Order, the Board reprimanded the Respondent and
permanently prohibited him from: practicing physical medicine and rehabilitation or pain
medicine; and treating any patients on an ongoing basis with controlled dangerous
substances (“CDS”) for pain management or for detoxification from CDS. The Board also
permanently restricted the Respondent’s ability to prescribe Schedule II CDS and imposed

a series of non-permanent terms and conditions.
