On May 25, 2017, the Board received a written response from Dr. Bailey in which she

stated that she did not realize until after she had completed the ethics course that self-prescribing

with any other name than her own “would get [her] into trouble.” She also stated that she wrote

the prescriptions for herself to “continue my therapy with medications previously prescribed to

me for [certain] . . . diagnosed conditions.” >

On June 12, 2017, MPRP notified Dr. Bailey in writing that she was being discharged

from MPRP “for cause.” The causes cited by MPRP included Dr. Bailey’s failure to comply with

conditions of her Rehabilitation Agreement and Rehabilitation Plan as follows:

a.

Her arrest on May 10, 2017 resulting in MPRP’s inability to monitor her for at least
nine days;

Her admission in a phone call on May 19, 2017, that she had been self-prescribing for
the duration of her participation in MPRP since September 2016, which is a violation
of Provision 12° of her Agreement.

Her termination as a patient by her psychiatrist due to non-compliance in treatment;
MPRP’s inability to meet with her; and

Her refusal to sign a practice cessation agreement that was sent to her on May 30,

2017, followed by two additional reminders that were sent by email and two by
telephone.

A subsequent Board investigation confirmed Dr. Bailey’s arrest for prescription fraud in

Virginia in 2017 and the termination of her employment by the pediatric practice on Maryland’s

Eastern shore. Dr. Bailey also admitted to self-prescribing in a sworn Board interview.

Provision 12 of Dr. Bailey’s MPRP Agreement states: I will neither self-prescribe nor provide my own

medical care or treatment.
