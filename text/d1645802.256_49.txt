There were no drug screens performed to determine compliance with the treatment
program. Additionally, there were requests for early refills of medication which were honored

counting or other methods to determine if the patient was diverting his medication.

Most importantly, the Respondent acknowledges that he did not treat the underlying
cause of the pain in this patient. He stated that “No disability was removed, but there was
progress towards improving the quality of his life.” (Tr. 322). The patient did have an
improvement in the quality of his life, especially since he was taken off of methadone, but the
Respondent failed to refer the Patient to qualified medical practitioners to treat the underlying
source of his pain and to determine if treatments other than opioid therapy could be utilized to
either reduce the need for opioids or eliminate them entirely, Addressing pain through drug
therapy is only one means of treating a patient, Other treatments or modalities were not
considered or if they were, not recommended by the Respondent in the case of Patient G.

from a neurologist or psychiatrist to confirm these findings,
