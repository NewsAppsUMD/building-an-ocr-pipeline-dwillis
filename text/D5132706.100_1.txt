NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, Dr. Doh has the right to request a full evidentiary hearing
before an Administrative Law Judge at the Office of Administrative Hearings. This request will
be granted if the Board receives a written request for the hearing within TEN (10) days of the
date of this letter. Any request for a hearing should be sent to Christine A. Farrelly, Executive
Director, at the Boardâ€™s address. If Dr. Doh requests such a hearing, the regulations require that
an Administrative Law Judge set the hearing to begin within 30 days of the request, see COMAR
10.32.02.081, though Dr. Doh may waive that 30-day requirement.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel A resulting from

formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely yours,

Signature on File

Christine A. Farrelly, Rxebutive Diredtor
Maryland State Board of Physicians
