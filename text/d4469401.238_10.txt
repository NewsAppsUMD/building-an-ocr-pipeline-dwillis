discharge of Dr. Bailey for cause was based on that violation of her Rehabilitation Agreement
and her failure to comply with other conditions of her Rehabilitation Plan. In addition, the State
highlighted the fact that Dr. Bailey was no longer under the care of a mental health provider
because her psychiatrist had terminated her as a patient due to her non-compliance with
treatment. The State also pointed out the serious concerns of MPRP’s clinical team regarding Dr.
Bailey’s inability to make progress in the program.

Dr. Bailey stated that she was now under the care of a primary care physician who is
responsible for prescribing her medications, and that she was making progress in another
program since the summary suspension hearing.

By self-prescribing and refilling medications under a fictitious name, by being terminated
from the pediatric practice where she had been employed, by being terminated from outpatient
therapy by her psychiatrist, and by being terminated for cause by MPRP, Dr. Bailey failed to
comply with Provision 12 of her MPRP Rehabilitation Agreement and the therapy, check-in,
meeting, vocational and toxicology monitoring requirements of her MPRP Rehabilitation Plan.
Based upon all of the information presented at the show cause hearing, Panel B finds that Dr.
Bailey failed to comply with Condition 1 of her probation and the 2016 Consent Order. Dr.
Bailey’s violation is undisputed.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Disciplinary Panel B concludes that Dr. Bailey violated Condition 1 of her probation and

the 2016 Consent Order.
