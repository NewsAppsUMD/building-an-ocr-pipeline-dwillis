I. The Complaint

4. On or about August 15, 2016, the Board received a complaint from a former
patient of the Respondent ("Patient A")' who expressed concerns about the Respondent’s
conduct during an office visit. Patient A complained that Respondent kissed Patient A on
the cheek and while hugging her “was massaging [her] back as [she] cried which he had
never done before." Patient A also complained that Respondent also made inappropriate
comments to her about offering to "find her a boyfriend" and stating that he was "available"
for that purpose. Patient A also recounted that after her last office visit, the Respondent
contacted her by telephone and informed her that he was “attracted” to her and was
“available.” |

5. After reviewing this complaint, the Board initiated an investigation of this
matter. While investigating this complaint, the Board reviewed a previous complaint
against the Respondent that alleged similar misconduct. The Board's investigation
determined that the Respondent engaged in inappropriate boundary violations with
female patients, which constitute violations of the Act and the Board’s sexual misconduct

regulations.
