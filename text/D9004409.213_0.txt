FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
PROCEDURAL HISTORY

Oluwatobi A. Yerokun, M.D., was licensed to practice medicine in the State of Maryland
on July 20, 2020, under License Number D90044. On September 21, 2022, in the United States
District Court for the Western District of Missouri, Dr. Yerokun pled guilty to one count of
Conspiracy to Make False Statements Related to Health Care Matters, 18 U.S.C. § 371 (U.S.A v.
Oluwatobi Alabi Yerokun, Case # 22-cr-221-HFS).!

On February 2, 2023, the Office of the Attorney General filed with the Maryland Board of
Physicians (the “Board”) a petition to suspend Dr. Yerokun’s license to practice medicine (the
“Petition to Suspend”) and a proposed show cause order pursuant to section 14-404(b)(1) of the:
Maryland Medical Practice Act. On May 19, 2023, Board Disciplinary Panel A issued an Order
suspending the license of Dr. Yerokun, pursuant to Health Occ. § 14-404(b)(1).?

On March 13, 2023, Dr. Yerokun was sentenced to five years of supervised probation and

ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $399,021.00. On August 4, 2023, the Office of the

' 18 U.S.C. § 371 states in pertinent part:

If two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud
the United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such
persons do any act to affect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be fined under this title or
imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

? At the time the Petition was filed in this case, Dr. Yerokun had not yet been sentenced. Accordingly, the Petition to
Suspend Dr. Yerokun’s license was filed pursuant to Health Occ. § 14-404(b)(1) instead of a petition to revoke
pursuant to Health Occ. § 14-404(b)(2), which is now warranted after the completion of sentencing.
