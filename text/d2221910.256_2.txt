that there was no fetal heart rate and the fetus was already deceased, Dr. Alexander injected
digoxin’ and lidocaine,‘ administered mifeprex,' and inserted laminaria‘ to cause fetal demise and
induce labor. Around midnight, Dr. Alexander administered midazolam,’ a sedative medication,
to Patient A, released Patient A to her husband, and they went to a nearby hotel. About four
hours later, Patient A called Dr. Alexander and told him that she was going into labor. Dr.
Alexander met Patient A at his office around 5:00 a.m., on March 1, 2014, administered
misoprostol,’ and delivered the stillborn fetus at 9:00 a.m.
EXCEPTIONS
I Standard of Care
The ALJ found Dr. Alexander violated the standard of care by performing a medically
induced abortion at his private office instead of referring the patient to a higher level facility. Dr.
Alexander takes exception to this finding and argues that medically induced abortions can be
safely performed in outpatient settings up to 34 weeks as long as the physician has specialized
training and experience. The State argues, however, that the procedure was not an abortion, but
rather, the delivery of a stillborn fetus, which required labor and delivery to occur at a higher

level facility, in accordance with the usual obstetric protocols.

> Digoxin is used to induce fetal demise and, generally, would be used before a surgical abortion or a second
trimester medical abortion.

* Lidocaine is a local anesthetic.
* Mifeprex is a medication that is taken orally and is approved for use in early non-surgical abortion procedures.
‘ Laminaria is used to dilate the cervix and induce labor and delivery.

* The medical records reflect that midazolam was also administered the following day, on March 1, 2014, at 5:00
a.m., 7:00 a.m., and 9:00 a.m.

* Misoprostol is used in conjunction with mifeprex in early non-surgical abortion procedures to induce labor and
ripen the cervix prior to delivery.
