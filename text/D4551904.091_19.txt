 

Ms, Dicken subpoenaed M.P.D. and M.S.A.0.’s patient records from the Respondent and

reviewed them. She noted that the information in the record was consistent with the patient

- complaints in terms of the exams completed, and the dates of the most recent and final _
appointments. In the records, which were introduced into the record as Board Exhibits 17 and
18, the Respondent had drawn pictures of breasts throughout to indicate the dates that MPD.
and M.S.A.0. were scheduled for appointments.

On February 21, 2019, Ms. Dicken interviewed both M.P.D. and MS.A.0. M.P.D.
