Physician A is board-certified in internal medicine and maintains an office

employed and could reliably be seen on time;

Respondent was never in the office seeing patients when Physician A was
present;

On occasion, the office manager handed a prescription to a patient, when
Respondent was not in the office; and

appointments.
