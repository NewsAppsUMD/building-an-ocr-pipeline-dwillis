On or about May 1, 2015, the Respondent transmitted to the Board a form
entitled, “Application for Licensure for Polysomnographic Technologists —
Applicant's Preferred Date of License” and a money order in the amount of
$200.00.

The form submitted by the Respondent was not a licensure renewal application
which is required to renew a licensee’s license.

The Respondent's license expired on May 30, 2015.

By letter dated September 15, 2015, the Respondent was notified by the Board
that his license had expired on May 30, 2015, and that he was no longer
authorized to practice polysomnography. The letter further advised the
Respondent that he was required to apply for reinstatement of his license.
Appended to the Board’s letter was an Application for Reinstatement of
Polysomnographic Technologist License.

On or about October 5, 2015, the Respondent completed and transmitted to the
Board the Application for Reinstatement.

Effective December 8, 2015, the Respondent's license to practice
polysomnography was reinstated and he was notified by the Board of the
reinstatement.

Panel B’s investigation revealed that the Respondent practiced polysomnography
from May 31, 2015 through December 7, 2015. Specifically, the Respondent

performed technician services for approximately 163 patients during that period.
