33. While the Respondent examined Patient 1 on January 24, 2014, Person 1 was
seated in a chair to the left of the bed on the opposite side of the cubicle from where the
Respondent was examining Patient 1. The Respondent closed the curtains. Person 1 was outside
the curtains. (Test. Patient 1, T. at 209.)

34. On January 24, 2014, the Respondent began his examination of Patient 1 by
having her stand with her arms spread out in front of her. With gloves on his hands, he sat on a
movable stool and started palpating at the base of Patient 1’s legs and continued to move his
- hands up her body until they reached underneath her hospital gown. He kept moving up until his

hands touched Patient 1’s vagina. Once there, the Respondent put his fingers inside Patient 1’s
vagina, and while doing so, his knuckles touched Patient 1’s clitoris. (rest Patient 1, T. at 209—
10, 212.) .

35. When Patient 1 felt the Respondent’s fingers inside her vagina, she became
annoyed. She asked the Respondent “Why are you doing this? You already determined there’s
nothing there triggering any pain. So, why you keep doing this?” The Respondent did not
respond. He ignored her and continued to feel around Patient 1’s vagina. (Test. Patient 1, T. at
209-11; Test. Person 1, T. at 288; State’s Ex. 8 at 22.)

36. After completing his examination of Patient 1, the Respondent took off his gloves,
sniffed them, rolled them up, and threw them in the trash. The Respondent sat on the stool for a
little while, then exited to the hallway, throwing his arms in the air as he walked away from the
examination cubicle. (Test. Person 1, T. at 289; State’s Ex. 9 at 13.)

37. After the Respondent examined Patient 1, he took Patient 1 to the ASC and
administered the steroid injection/cooled radiofrequency ablation of lateral branch to her in her

lower back under sedation. (State’s Ex. 41 at 140-68.)
