Re: — Surrender of License to Practice Respiratory Care
Thomas F, Fahey, Jr., RCP
License Number: L06311
Case Number: 7724-0017

Dear Dr. Ajrawat and Members of Disciplinary Panel B:

Please be advised that, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. (“Health Occ.”)
§14-5A-16 (2021 Repl. Vol.), I have decided to SURRENDER my license to practice as
a Respiratory Care Practitioner in the State of Maryland, License Number L06311,
effective immediately. I understand that upon surrender of my license, | may not give
advice or treatment to any individual, with or without compensation, and cannot engage in
the practice of Respiratory Care in the State of Maryland as it is defined in the Respiratory
Care Practitioners Act (the “Act”), Health Occ.§§ 14-5A-01 et seg. and other applicable
laws. In other words, as of the effective date of this Letter of Surrender, I understand that
the surrender of my license means that I am in the same position as an unlicensed individual
in the State of Maryland.

I understand that this Letter of Surrender is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT, and upon
Disciplinary Panel B’s (“Panel B”) acceptance, it becomes a FINAL ORDER of Panel B
of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”).

I acknowledge that the Board initiated an investigation based on my violation of
my Participant Rehabilitation Agreement (“PRA”) and Participant Rehabilitation Plan
(“PRP”) with the Maryland Professional Rehabilitation Program (“MPRP”) and the Order
Terminating Suspension and Imposing Probation issued on July 9, 2021. On September 8,
2023, Panel B issued an Order After Show Cause Hearing that placed me on a new
probation period for a minimum of three (3) years and required that I continue to participate
in MPRP based on a second instance of failure to comply with my PRA and PRP.
