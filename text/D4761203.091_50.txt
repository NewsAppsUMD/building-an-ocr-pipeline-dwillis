oncologists are trained in this procedure. The Respondent, as a GYN oncologist, received
training and is skilled in this procedure.

6. The Respondent contracts with various insurance companies to receive
reimbursement after performing procedures, Various medical procedures are assigned Current
Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. When making a claim to an insurance company, the

_ provider will utilize the CPT code associated with the procedure performed. The insurance
company will then, pursuant to its contract with the provider, reimburse the provider for the
procedure associated with that CPT code.

7, CPT codes in the 50,000 range concern OB/GYN procedures. CPT codes in the
30,000 range concern cardiology procedures.

8. . The CPT code for uterine artery ligation is 37617. Typically providers will only
bill the CPT code for hysterectomies when performing that procedure. The Respondent would
typically bill the CPT codes for both the hysterectomy procedure and the uterine artery ligation. .

9. Removal of the uterus during a hysterectomy creates an opening between the
interior of the vagina and the portion of the body cavity where the uterus was once located, This
opening is called the vaginal cuff. A surgeon must suture the vaginal cuff closed to prevent the
contents of the body cavity (e.g, the bowels) from entering the vagina.

10. There are a variety of sutures from which a GYN surgeon can choose to close the
vaginal cuff. Examples of sutures are absorbable, which do not require removal and non-
absorbable, which require removal. Vicryl is a common absorbable suture used to close vaginal
cuffs. Ethibond is a common non-absorbable suture. Ethibond is a suture approved by the Food

and Drug Administration (FDA) for soft tissue closure. Ethibond and Vicryl are similar in feel

and look.
