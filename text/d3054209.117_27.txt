Sanctioning Recommendation

Having found the State proved the Respondent engaged in unprofessional conduct in
the practice of medicine, I now turn to the question of what sanction, if any, is appropriate, The
State recommended a one-year suspension of the Respondent’s license, along with a referral to
the MPRP, The State further recommended the Respondent submit to a neurocognitive
evaluation, the results of which could enable the Board to address his conduct more decisively.
Alternatively, if I find there is no purpose in attempting remediation, the State recoramended a
revocation of the Respondents license.

The Respondent recommended a sanction that is remedial or rehabilitative in nature
and argued a lengthy suspension would essentially be the end of his career as a physician. The
Respondent is willing to be referred to the MPRP and willing to comply with any conditions or
requirements imposed by the Board and related to addressing his propensity for being easily
provoked. The Respondent further indicated that he has enrolled in an anger management
program (see Resp. Ex. 6) and he is willing to submit to a neurocognitive evaluation.

The guiding regulations in this matter; found at COMAR 10.09.32.09B, provide in
pertinent part as follows:

B. ‘“Ageravating and. Mitigating Factors.

(1) Depending on the facts and circumstances of each case, and to the extent

fhat the facts and circumstances apply, the disciplinary panel may consider the

aggravating and mitigating factors set out in §B(5) and (6) of this regulation

and may in its discretion determine, based on those factors, that an exception

should be made and that the sanction in a particular case should fall outside the

range of sanctions listed in the sanctioning guidelines.

(5). Mitigating factors may include, but are not limited to, the following:
