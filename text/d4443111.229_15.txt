that he pressed the stethoscope against the patient's chest under her shirt. The Panel accepts the
ALJ's finding that the medical assistant's testimony was not credible.

Moreover, the father’s testimony that he did not go back to the examination room is
convincing.

The Panel finds that Patient A's father did not go to the examination room during the
October 29, 2015, visit and that the Respondent did not discuss Patient A's condition with her
father that day.

Medical Urgency

The Respondent takes exception to the ALJ's findings addressing the urgency of his
examination of Patient A. The crux of the Respondent's argument seems to be that, because of the
urgency of the matter, the Respondent was medically justified in conducting an examination
without waiting for the presence of Patient A’s father. For example, the Respondent takes
exception to the ALJ's finding of fact 8 that [for anaphylaxis to be present, two major anatomical
systems, such as skin, respiratory or cardiac, must exhibit some allergic reaction.". The ALJ
premised this finding on the testimony of the Respondent's expert witness, who testified:

..., the serious allergic reactions in the context of having gotten a known

injection with something you're allergic to involves two systems being

involved. So we're looking particularly for evidence of hives in the skin

and a respiratory component or a cardiavascular component with regard

to change in blood pressure or pulse.
(T. 338.) The Respondent argues, notwithstanding this testimony from his own witness, that the
ALJ's finding is a "material oversimplification.” Ultimately, the dispute as to whether the
Respondent groped Patient A's breasts does not turn on whether there was a medical urgency for

an examination or whether the Respondent reasonably believed there was medical urgency. And

it certainly does not turn on the indicators for anaphylaxis. The dispute turns on the credibility of
