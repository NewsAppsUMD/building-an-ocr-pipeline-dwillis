C. Individual 10

The ALJ found that when Individual 10 was a patient of the Respondent, the Respondent
grabbed her breasts at his private practice office and touched her vagina during pre-op ‘at the
Hospital. The Respondent mentions the informed consent procedures and administrative duties
at the Respondent’s office in what appears to be an attempt to show that Individual 10 was not left
alone with the Respondent. The Respondent states, “[Individual 10]’s account had Respondent
involved in these activities which conflicted with the medical records and Respondent's role in
patient encounters.” The Respondent does not identify the “medical records” he mentions, nor
does the Respondent identify what account by Individual 10 relates to this issue. The ALJ decision
discussed the medical records in extensive detail, but the Respondent does not address the specific
records the ALJ analyzed nor the ALJ’s discussion of those records.

In any case, the office visit medical record for Individual 10’s March 16, 2017, visit was
generated by the Respondent and identifies the Respondent as the provider. This document
describes the assessment/plan, stating that the Respondent recommends a “synovial cyst resection
and hemilaminectoiny,” and it also mentions the Respondent’s discussion of pars fractures that
could some day require “fusion.” This medical record, which was generated by the Respondent,
then states, “J discussed the risks benefits and alternatives with the patient including lumbar fusion
however despite the risks, the patient would like to proceed.” (Italics added.) The Respondent
makes a further claim concerning “[Individual 10]’s report” and “informed consent and pre-

operative interviews.” This claim also does not cite to the evidentiary record.
