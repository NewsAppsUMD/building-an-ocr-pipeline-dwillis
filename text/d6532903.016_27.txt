DISCUSSION
Applicable Law/Policies

The Board has charged the Respondent with violating section 14~-404(a)(3)(ii) of the Act.
The relevant grounds for reprimand or probation of a licensee, or the suspension or revocation of

- alicense under the Act include the following:

(a) In general. — Subject to the hearing provisions of § 14-405 of this subtitle,
a disciplinary panel, on the affirmative vote of a majority of the quorum of
the disciplinary panel, may reprimand any licensee, place any licensee on
probation, or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee:
(3) Is guilty of
Gi) Unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine[.]
Mad. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii) (2014).

While the Act fails to provide any standard for or definition of the phrase “unprofessional
conduct,” the Maryland Court of Appeals reasonably defined the term to include conduct that
breaches rules or ethical codes of professional conduct or conduct unbecoming to a member in good

standing in the profession. Finucan v. Maryland Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance, 380 Md. 577,
