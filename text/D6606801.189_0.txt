Re: Surrender of License to Practice Medicine
Brandt E. Rice, M.D. License Number: D66068
Case Number: 2218-0156B

Dear Dr. Freas and Members of Disciplinary Panel B,

Please be advised that, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. (“Health Occ.”)
§14-403 (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2018 Supp.), I have decided to SURRENDER my license to
practice medicine in the State of Maryland, License Number D66068, effective
immediately. I understand that upon surrender of my license, I may not give medical advice
or treatment to any individual, with or without compensation, and cannot prescribe
medications or otherwise engage in the practice of medicine in the State of Maryland as it
is defined in the Maryland Medical Practice Act (the “Act”), Health Occ. §§ 14-101 ef seq.
and other applicable laws. In other words, as of the effective date of this Letter of
Surrender, I understand that the surrender of my license means that I am in the same
position as an unlicensed individual in the State of Maryland.

I understand that this Letter of Surrender is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT, and upon
Disciplinary Panel B’s (“Panel B”) acceptance, becomes a FINAL ORDER of Panel B of
the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”).

I acknowledge that the Board initiated an investigation of my practice and on
September 14, 2018, Panel B issued disciplinary charges against me under Health Occ. §
14-404(a)(3)(ii) (unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine) and (33) (failure to
cooperate with a Board investigation). Specifically, Panel B alleged that I prescribed and
obtained large amounts of opioids for over two years for a fictitious individual and failed
to produce patient records or appear for an interview with the Board. A copy of the charges
is attached as Attachment 1. I have decided to surrender my license to practice medicine in
the State of Maryland to avoid further investigation and prosecution of these disciplinary
charges.

I wish to make it clear that I have voluntarily, knowingly and freely chosen to
submit this Letter of Surrender to avoid further prosecution of the disciplinary charges. I
