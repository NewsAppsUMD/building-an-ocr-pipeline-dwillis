federal regulations at 45 C.F.R. § 46, Subpart A (Common Rule), and 21.C.F.R. §§ 50 and 56.
(Resp. Exh. 4)

In any event, the guidance belatedly embraced by Dr. MacKoul in his exceptions does not
compel or even suggest a contrary analysis of the regulatory provisions on human subject research
and IRB requirements. Like Dr. MacKoul’s arguments at the evidentiary hearing, the guidance to
which he cites presupposes that his Ethibond versus Vicryl study from 2013 to 2016 involved
quality improvement, clinical innovation, and retrospective record review. His exceptions
arguments depend entirely on these same representations that the ALJ rejected as not credible. The
ALI did not find Dr. MacKoul’s representations persuasive or credible because he determined that
they were inconsistent with the nature of the actions taken by Dr. MacKoul from 2013-2016. Prop.
Dec. at 55-59, The Panel agrees. Dr. MacKoul’s description of his activities in his exceptions as
quality improvement, clinical innovation, and retrospective record review does not make them so.
His strained legal arguments and reliance on OHRP guidance as a novel substitute for the
applicable federal regulations and Maryland law are without merit. The Panel gives no weight to
these arguments. Pursuant to State Gov’t § 10-213(i), the Panel has used sits experience, technical
competence, and specialized knowledge” in evaluating the evidence in the documentary and
testimonial record, including Dr. MacKoul’s own account of his actions to the Board in 2016 and
2017. As set forth below, this evidence contradicts his representations.

1. Written Response to the Complaint and Board Interview

There was no dispute that Dr. MacKoul responded to a complaint from a health insurance
company by submitting to the Board a document dated October 10, 2016 that was entitled “Vaginal
Cuff Dehiscence After Laparoscopic Hysterectomy: Comparing Absorbable to Nonabsorbable
Sutures.” (St. Exh. 3) In April, 2017, Dr. MacKoul subsequently submitted a similar but updated

version of this document dated October 31, 2016, with the same title. (St. Exh. 4, PM3638-3652)
