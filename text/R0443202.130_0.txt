Case No.: 2219-0187
License No.: R04432

Dear Mr. Khan, Mr. Molloie, and Mr. Gilbert:

On January 28, 2020, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF RADIOGRAPHY LICENSE in this
case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2019 Supp.).

Pursuant to the Order, on February 12, 2020, Disciplinary Panel A held a post-deprivation
hearing to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. Mr. Khan and his counsel,
Zachary Molloie, Esq. attended the hearing on that date. The State was represented by Robert
Gilbert, Deputy Counsel. Both parties presented oral arguments at the hearing.

After considering these arguments at the hearing and the investigative file, Disciplinary
Panel A determined that it would continue the summary suspension imposed on January 28,
2020. Disciplinary Panel A thus will not lift the summary suspension order. Disciplinary Panel A
finds that the public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires the suspension of Mr. Khan’s
license. See State Gov’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i). The order of summary suspension is thus reaffirmed
and continues. See COMAR 10.32.02.08H(1).
