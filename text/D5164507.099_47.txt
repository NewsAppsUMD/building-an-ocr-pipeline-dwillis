Patient 2 testified that she was “very shocked” and “it just blew me away” upon learning
" that the Respondent had a “romantic” relationship with Person. 1.

Patient 1 told the Board her sessions with the Respondent changed after he started
“dealing” with Person 1. She explained that he spent less time with her in sessions or she did not
have to come to his office because he said she could just “call” him. .

. The Board offered no legal authority to support its contention that a psychiatrist’s sexual
relationship with a consenting adult who is a non-key third party of a patient violates section 14-
404(a)(3)(ii) of the Business Occupations Article. I do not find Patient 2’s reactive shock or
blown mind transforms what was.not sexual misconduct into unprofessional conduct in the
practice of medicine.

- In regard to Patient 1, there was no evidence to corroborate her testimony that the
Respondent's treatrnent of her changed in any way due to the Respondent’s sexual relationship
with Person 1. ,

Was the fight between the Respondent and Person 1 unprofessional conduct in the practice
of medicine? :

Just as above, the Board did not contend that the fight between the Respondent and
Person 1 was, by itself, unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine. It contended that the
fight’s negative impact of the Respondent’s therapeutic relationship with Patients 1 or.2 is what
" made the fight professional misconduct in the practice of medicine in violation of section 14-

404(a)(3)(ii) of the Business Occupations Article.”*

 

26 COMAR 10.32.17.02 addresses a sexual misconduct by licensed physicians, It prohibits sexual impropriety with
a “key third party,” which is “an individual who participates in the health and welfare of the patient concurrent with
the physician-patient relationship.” COMAR 10.32.17.02B(1)(a). The Board did not contend that Person 1 was a

“key third. party” for either Patient 1 or Patient 2,
