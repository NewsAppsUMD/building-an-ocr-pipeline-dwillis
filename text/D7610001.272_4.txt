wake him when he was sleeping at the desk. On that date, the Respondent disclosed to
her that he had taken his pain medication that day.

14. On August 30, 2021, the Assistant explained how she once again found the
Respondent sleeping at his desk and tapped him on the shoulder to inform him that a
patient was waiting for him.

15. It was approximately 10:00am when the Respondent was asked to stop
seeing patients and to consent to a breathalyzer. The Assistant explained that at 4:42pm
she was asked to perform a breathalyzer on the Respondent. The first breathalyzer was
positive (BAC .182) and so was a second conducted at 4:45pm (BAC .175).

16. On January 7, 2022, the CRNP was interviewed by Board staff under oath.
The CRNP stated that she had worked with the Respondent approximately ten (10) times
including on August 30, 2021. The CRNP added that the Respondent would often come
to work “very drowsy” and would be “an hour or two late.” On one occasion,
approximately one month prior to the incident, the CRNP asked the Respondent why he
was so sleepy. The CRNP recalled the Respondent saying that he had knee surgery and
had taken his Percocet around 3:00am or 4:00am that morning.

17. Recalling August 30, 2021, the CRNP explained that on other occasions
when the Respondent fell asleep at work, she could easily wake him to remind him that
he had patients waiting, however on that day, it was different. The CRNP added:

[H]e was harder to arouse . . . nothing was startling him. Like if you

try to wake him . . . he’d be right back to sleep. So, it’s, like, he
wasn’t even there. Like, he didn’t hear you at all.
