it may seem unlikely the Respondent could earn ten CME credits in twelve days, the fact of the
matter is that at the time the Board issued the Charges, the Respondent was not yet in violation of
the CME requirement. I decline to find the Respondent violated section 12-102(c)(2)(i)(4)(M)
of the Pharmacy Act .

Willful Making of a False Record or Report and Willful Making of a False Representation
When Seeking a License

Under section 14-404(a)(11) of the Medical Practice Act, the Board is authorized to
discipline a physician who willfully makes or files a false report or record in the practice of
medicine, Section 14-404(a)(36) authorizes discipline when a physician willfully makes a false
representation when seeking or making application for licensure or other application related to
the practice of medicine. The State argued the Respondent violated these provisions of the
Medical Practice Act when, on April 26, 2013, he signed the attestation on the Application for
Physician’s Permit to Dispense Prescription Drugs. The attestation states as follows: “I am
thoroughly familiar with the statutes and regulations which govern physician dispensing of ,
prescription drugs, including Health Occupations Article §§ 12-102, 12-505, and 12-604 ... and
[COMAR] 10.3.01, 10.19.03.04, 10.19.03.05, and 10.19.03.07.” (Joint Ex. 1, p. 1.)

According to the State, when the OCSA inspector conducted her site visit on February
21, 2017, there were several requirements related to dispensing with which the Respondent
seemed unfamiliar. Additionally, during the Board’s investigation, there were a number of times
when the Respondent conceded he was not familiar with the statutes and regulations related to
the dispensing of prescription medication. (Joint Exs. 7, 8, 12.) The State took the position that
because the Respondent admitted he was unaware of the statutory and regulatory dispensing
requirements during the investigation, it was more likely than not he was unaware of the

requirements at the time he signed the dispensing permit application on April 26, 2013.
