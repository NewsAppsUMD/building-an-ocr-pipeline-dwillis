Patient 1 told the Board that the Respondent told Person 1 that she (Patient 1) was really
sick and crazy and had a “split personality.” Patient 1 also said that the Respondent described
Patient 2 as “suffering with depression” and had “OD” or “ODC,” was “crazy as hell,” and was
“bipolar”

Patient 2 testified that Person 1 told her the Respondent talked about her Catient 2’s)
diagnosis and talked about how she would “constantly ask [the Respondent] to change {her}
medication.” Patient 2 also told the Board that the Respondent told Patient 1 cnet RR ws
“retarded” and he felt sorry for Patient 2.

The Respondent denied disclosing “private health information” about-Patients 1 or 2 to
anyone, He specifically denied telling Person 1 that Patient 1 was like a trapped “rat” in a cage
that would destroy or kill or was crazy 3 .

In defending against the allegation that he disclosed confidential information about
Patient 2, the Respondent argued Patient 2 had a close social relationship with Person | and
Patient 1, suggesting that Patient 2 talked about her mental health status and treatment with them
as their friend. In support of this defense, the Respondent pointed out that Patient 2 was a client
at the hair salon, and she admitted she formed a friendship with Person 1 and Patient 1 that grew
closer over time.

The Respondent’s argument fits into his broader defense that the complaints filed against
him filed with the Board are the fruition of Person 1’s threats to ruin his life, if he did not submit
to her extortionist demands. According to the Respondent, his decision in early August 2016 to
stop giving in to Person 1’s extortionist demand for money triggered the false complaints against
him. In this theory, Patient 2 is presumably either knowingly or unwittingly complicit in this

nefarious plan; that is, she told Patient 1 and Person 1 about her‘diagnosis and the Respondent’s

23 person 1’s testimony was that the Respondent referred to Patient 1 as a “wreck,” not as a “rat.”
