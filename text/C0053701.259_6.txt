5. On receipt of the complaint, the Board initiated an investigation which included
issuing a subpoena for a PDMP report of the Respondent’s prescribing, issuing
subpoenas to Facility A for a total of ten patient records and issuing a subpoena to
Hospital A for Patient 4’s records.

6. On or about March 24, 2017, the Board notified the Respondent of the complaint
filed relating to Patient 4 and requested a written response.

7. On or about April 14, 2017, the Respondent submitted a written response to the
Board regarding Patient 4. The Respondent stated that he had no knowledge of Patient
4’s prescription(s) by her primary care provider for oxycodone, or that she had been
treated for an overdose at Hospital A. Shortly thereafter, the Respondent submitted
“summaries of care” for all ten patients as requested by the Board.

8. On or about July 5, 2017, Board staff interviewed the Respondent under oath at
the Board’s offices. The Respondent acknowledged that he had not completed any
coursework or specialized training in pain management. The Respondent stated that
although his supervising physician is available anytime and has access to the medical
records of the patients the Respondent sees, he does not “typically” call him as he (the
Respondent) has been seeing patients as a PA for 38 years.

9. In furtherance of its investigation, on or about October 24, 2017, Board staff
transmitted ten patient records and other relevant investigative documents to Permedion
requesting that a peer review be conducted of the Respondent's practice. On or about
January 9, 2018, the Board received the peer review report regarding the Respondent's

care and treatment of Patients 1-10.
