date of this letter. Any request for a hearing should be sent to Christine A. Farrelly, Executive
Director, at the Boardâ€™s address. If Mr. Dailey requests such a hearing, the regulations require
that an Administrative Law Judge set the hearing to begin within 30 days of the request, see
COMAR 10.32.02.08I, though Mr. Dailey may waive that 30-day requirement.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel B resulting from

formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely yours,

Signature on File

Ellen Douglas Smith, Deputy Director
Maryland State Board of Physicians
