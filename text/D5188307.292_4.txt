boundaries. Further, Dr. Mikhail’s treatment was informal, outside of the office, and he failed to
treat Family Member 1 as he treated other patients as demonstrated by his failure to keep
progress notes (medical records), including for his prescribing of medications including CDS.

Treatment of Family Member 2

Dr. Mikhail also prescribed medication for Family Member 2 from 2013 to 2020. Again,
the treatment was not emergency care, short term care, or care rendered until another provider
became available. Family Member 2 resided in another country and Dr. Mikhail did not make
periodic examinations, maintain records, or even speak with Family Member 2’s primary treating
physician, instead relying on Family Member 2 to keep him updated about other medications that
Family Member 2 was taking.

Dr. Mikhail, however, did not write prescriptions to Family Member 2, Instead of
writing prescriptions in Family Member 2’s name, Dr. Mikhail wrote the prescriptions for
Family Member 1 who would then fill the prescription locally at a pharmacy and then transport
the medication to Family Member 2 abroad through intermediaries who happened to be traveling
to Family Member 2’s location outside the United States. Dr. Mikhail intentionally wrote those
prescriptions in the wrong name. “Willfully” making a false report “requires proof that the
conduct at issue was done intentionally, not that it was committed with the intent to deceive or
with malice.” Kim v. Maryland State Bd. of Physicians, 423 Md. 523, 546 (2011). Dr. Mikhail
acknowledged that he knowingly, willingly, and voluntarily made untrue statements in writing
that the prescriptions in Family Member 1’s name when the medications were intended for

Family Member 2 to use.
