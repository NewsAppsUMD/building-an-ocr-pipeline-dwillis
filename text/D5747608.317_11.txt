did not return the prescriptions. Dr. Dickinson’s partner also took
possession of one of Dr. Dickinson’s patient’s prescriptions for Subsys
and did not deliver the medication to the patient. Dr. Dickinson
documented destroying a third patient’s Subsys prescription, but the
medication, labeled to that third patient, was found in Dr. Dickinson’s
home. Dr. Dickinson similarly took possession of the Subsys
prescriptions of a fourth patient in her care.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Panel B adopts the ALJ’s proposed default order issued pursuant to COMAR
28.02.01.23A. Panel B thus finds the Respondent in default based upon the Respondent’s failure
to appear at the Office of Administrative Hearings for the Prehearing Conference scheduled for
July 6, 2017. See State Gov’t § 10-210(4). Based upon the findings of fact, Panel B concludes
that the Respondent is guilty of unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation
of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii); the Respondent was addicted to, or habitually abused, any
narcotic or controlled dangerous substance as defined in § 5-101 of the Criminal Law Article, in
violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(8); and the Respondent provided professional services
while using any narcotic or controlled dangerous substance, as defined in § 5-101 of the Criminal
Law Article, or other drug that is in excess of therapeutic amounts or without valid medical
indication, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(9)(ii).
Sanction
The ALJ recommended the revocation of the Respondent’s license to practice medicine
in Maryland. Panel B adopts the ALJ’s recommendation.
