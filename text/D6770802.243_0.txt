Consent Order dated December 14, 2017, in which Disciplinary Panel A (“Panel A”) suspended
her medical license and required her to enroll in the Maryland Professional Rehabilitation Program
(“MPRP”) after concluding that she violated certain provisions of the Medical Practice Act; (2)
an Order Terminating Suspension and Imposing Probation dated May 25, 2018 (“May 2018
Order”) in which Panel A terminated the suspension, imposed probation for a minimum period of
three years, and required Dr. Andrews to comply with specific terms and conditions, including
continued enrollment in MPRP and compliance with a Participant Rehabilitation Agreement and
Participant Rehabilitation Plan; and (3) the November 2019 Order following Dr. Andrews’s
violation of the May 2018 Order and her admission of her non-compliance with her Participant
Rehabilitation Agreement at a show cause hearing held before Panel A in October, 2019. The 2019
Order reprimanded Dr. Andrews, imposed a new period of probation for a minimum of three years,
required her to remain enrolled in MPRP, and to fully comply with the requirements of a new
