emergency situations. Dr. Dooley acknowledges that a disciplinary panel has broad discretion in
sanctioning licensees and that the permissible sanction for a standard of care violation ranges
from a reprimand to a revocation. COMAR 10.32.02.10B(22). Dr. Dooley argues that the
mitigating factors in his case warrant a less severe sanction than a suspension. Panel B
disagrees.

The ALJ correctly recognized that Dr. Dooley’s care and treatment had the potential for
patient harm, The evidence shows that Dr. Dooley failed to address the underlying cause of his
patients’ pain before he resorted to prescribing opioids. Dr. Dooley’s pain management practices
made his patients more dependent on opioids, rather than less dependent. The ALJ concluded
that because Dr. Dooley “did not acknowledge any wrongdoing, his practice of issuing opioid
prescriptions would likely continue if he were permitted to return to his pain medicine practice.”
The Panel agrees. For all ten patients, a consistent pattern of serious deficiencies permeated Dr.
Dooley’s treatment regimen.

In his exceptions, Dr. Dooley cites several consent orders where the Board imposed less
severe sanctions on licensees for substandard pain medicine practice. Dr. Dooley, however, is
not similarly situated to practitioners who entered into consent orders as a result of settlement
negotiations.

After considering all of the evidence in this case, including the additional exhibits that
Dr. Dooley presented, Panel B denies Dr. Dooley’s exception to the ALJ’s proposed sanction.
