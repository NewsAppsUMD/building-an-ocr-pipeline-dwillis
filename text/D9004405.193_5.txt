Dr. Yerokun’s Crimes Involved Moral Turpitude.

Dr. Yerokun argues that the crime he pled guilty to is not a crime involving moral

defraud is an essential element of the crime that Dr. Yerokun pled guilty to. A “significant

characteristic of conspiracy to commit a crime is that the defendant, to be found guilty of

conspiracy, must have a specific intent to commit the offense which is the object of the
