represented by the administrative prosecutor, moved for a default judgment against the
Respondent and offered the exhibits that it had planned to offer into evidence if the matter had
proceeded to a merits hearing. The ALJ admitted those exhibits into evidence so that the
disciplinary panel of the Board would be able to consider them in reaching its final disposition.
Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 14-405 (2014).

Under OAH’s Rules of Procedure, “[i]f, after receiving proper notice, a party fails to
attend or participate in a prehearing conference, hearing, or other stage of a proceeding, the judge
may proceed in that party’s absence or may, in accordance with the hearing authority delegated
by the agency, issue a final or proposed default order against the defaulting party.” COMAR
28.02.01.23A. Similarly, the Health Occupations Article provides, in pertinent part:

(d) If after due notice the individual against whom the action is

contemplated fails or refuses to appear, nevertheless the hearing officer

may hear and refer the matter to the Board or a disciplinary panel for

disposition.

(e) After performing any necessary hearing under this section, the

hearing officer shall refer proposed factual findings to the Board or a

disciplinary panel for the Board’s or disciplinary panel’s disposition.
Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 14-405 (2014). Read in conjunction with the OAH Rules of
Procedure, subsection 14-405(d) which provides that the ALJ “may hear” the matter if the
individual fails to appear, and subsection (e), which uses the language “any necessary hearing,”
clearly contemplate situations such as defaults where no hearing is required. See also COMAR
28.02.01.23A.

The ALJ found the Respondent had proper notice of the July 6, 2017, Prehearing

Conference and failed to appear and participate in the Prehearing Conference.
