Physician-2

32. | When interviewed, Physician-2 stated that the Respondent failed to follow
Facility policies with respect to the January 26, 2022, scan, which would have included
flagging the CT report, noting the time of the review, communicating with the ordering
providers, and noting the time she communicated with those providers and the name of the
person with whom she communicated.

33.  Physician-2 noted prior concerns about the Respondent’s performance and
professionalism dating back to 2016, including her interpretation of vascular and cardiac
studies and her failure to respond to telephone, email and beeper messages. Physician-2
stated that the Respondent failed to accept responsibility for her performance lapses and
did not sufficiently respond to the Facility’s remediation efforts. Physician-2 stated that
the Respondent’s performance issues and unavailability were so serious that in or around
December 2021, the Facility imposed practice limitations on her.

34. Physician-2 stated that with respect to the January 26, 2022, CT scan report,
the Fellow informed Physician-2 that he attempted to speak to the Respondent about the
CT study but that the Respondent was distracted and did not communicate with him but
signed off on the report. Physician-2 stated that it was the Respondent’s responsibility to
place the critical finding documentation on the report and communicate with the ordering

provider(s) and document those discussions in the report.
