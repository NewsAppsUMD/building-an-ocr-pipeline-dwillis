On March 5, 2021, Panel A issued a Violation of Board Order and Notice to Show Cause,
alleging a violation of the terms and conditions of the September 3, 2020 Consent Order for
failing to comply with the terms of the Participant Rehabilitation Agreement she entered into
with MPRP. This Violation of Board Order and Notice to Show Cause was mailed to Ms. Hyler
at the address of record on file with the Board. The Violation of Board Order and Notice to
Show Cause stated: “Please be advised that Panel A is providing you with an opportunity to
appear before it and SHOW CAUSE why it should not impose sanctions against your license.
This Show Cause Hearing has been scheduled for WEDNESDAY May 12, 2021, at 1:00 p.m.
before Panel A at the Board’s offices, 4201 Patterson Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland 21215.”

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the hearing was scheduled to take place remotely
via the Zoom platform. On April 29, 2021, a Board staff member sent an email to Ms. Hyler
with instructions about the Zoom meeting and an invitation to attend a Zoom “test” on May 4,
2021, to allow Ms. Hyler to familiarize herself with the Zoom platform prior to her hearing on
May 12, 2021. Ms. Hyler did not respond to the email or attend the test. A Board staff member
sent Ms. Hyler another email, on May 6, 2021, offering her a second opportunity to participate in
a Zoom test call and giving the instructions for appearing remotely at the May 12, 2021 show
cause hearing. Again, Ms. Hyler did not respond to the email.

On May 11, 2021 at 5:10 p.m., the day before the scheduled hearing, Board staff sent to
Ms. Hyler’s email address a link to the Show Cause hearing through the Zoom platform and an
alternate telephone number along with instructions for how to join the meeting. Ms. Hyler did
not respond. On May 12, at 12:01 p.m., an hour before the scheduled Show Cause hearing,
Board staff again sent a link and alternate phone number to the Show Cause hearing to Ms.

Hyler’s email address, and the email further instructed Ms. Hyler to sign in 10 to 15 minutes
