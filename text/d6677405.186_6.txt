which included a discussion of the necessity for and benefits of chaperones for
both patient and physician.

In his under-oath interview with Board staff, Physician 2 stated that in addition to
instructing the Respondent to attend the chaperone CME seminar, he had
personally discussed with the Respondent the importance of chaperones and
had instructed the Respondent to have a chaperone present whenever he was
examining a female patient. Physician 2 told the Respondent that family
members were not to be used as chaperones.

In his interview, Physician 2 stated that the Respondent had affirmed his
understanding of the directive that a chaperone was to be present any time the
Respondent examined a female patient. Physician 2 stated that the Respondent
had told him that he (the Respondent) had learned a valuable lesson from
Patient 1’s complaint.

The Respondent told Medical Group personnel that he had attended the
chaperone seminar. The Respondent, however, failed to complete the process
by which to obtain certification for the seminar.
