d. Typically, when she does an initial visit with a patient she administers a
urine drug screen. However, she does not administer any additional
screens after the initial drug screen “if they’re not showing any life
problems.”

e. When asked how she knew her patients were not using illicit drugs if
she was not doing drug contracts or conducting urine drug screens, the
Respondent explained that her private practice patients were “normal
working people, good family people” and “don’t have any problems at
all that suggest drug use or drug abuse” because “when people use illicit
drugs, their life is messed up.” She further explained that she does
conduct routine urine testing for her patients from the Clinic “because
this is an entirely different population from my mostly upper middle
class private patients.”

f. The Respondent admitted that for several years she would write
Patient | three prescriptions at a time but would leave the date blank on
two of the prescriptions, and then the patient would fill the date in
before taking the prescriptions to the pharmacy to be filled. The
Respondent explained her actions by stating, “[t]his patient was, was a
responsible worker, had a steady, reliable life, was, had a, you know,
decent family life. There were no signs of drug abuse. He never lost his
prescriptions, the dog never ate his prescription and he never asked for

more. He was totally reliable.”
