The Panel further notes that this misstatement was not based on Dr. Smith’s mistaken
belief that the relationship was concurrent. When first asked about why he answered that he had
not had a personal relationship with a patient he was treating, Dr. Smith explained that he “was
in the mindset of the contemporary period. [Dr. Smith’s] relationship with [Patient B] was 13-15
years ago.” This is clearly not what the investigator was asking when she asked “Did you ever
have” such a relationship. At the hearing and exceptions, Dr. Smith changed his answer, and
now claims that he never had a concurrent sexual and patient relationship, because the patient
relationship had ended. The Panel does not believe Dr. Smith’s new explanation. The Panel
concludes that Dr. Smith intentionally withheld the prior overlapping sexual relationships and
patient relationships, which includes both his relationship with Patient B, but also his treatment
of his family members, to avoid a harsher sanction.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Panel B concludes that Dr. Smith is guilty of unprofessional conduct in the practice of
medicine, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii), for providing medical treatment to his
family members and also based on his sexual relationship with Patient B. Panel B concludes that
his sexual relationship with Patient B also violated the Board’s sexual misconduct relegations,
under COMAR 10.32.17.03. Panel B concludes that Dr. Smith is guilty of willfully making or
filing a false report in the practice of medicine, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(11), and
failing to cooperate with a lawful investigation conducted by the Board or a disciplinary panel, in
violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(33), for falsely stating that he had not had a prior sexual

relationship with a patient.
