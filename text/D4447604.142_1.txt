NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, Dr. Syme has the right to request a full evidentiary hearing
before an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Administrative Hearings. This request will
be granted if the Board receives a written request for the hearing within TEN (10) days of the
date of this letter. Any request for a hearing should be sent to Christine A. Farrelly, Executive
Director, Maryland Board of Physicians, 4201 Patterson Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland 21215. If
Dr. Syme requests such a hearing, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set
the hearing to begin within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08I, though Dr. Syme
may waive that 30-day requirement.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel A resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely yours,

Maryland State Board of Physicians
