 

28. Parent 3 subsequently sought a second opinion from a vision therapist who
advised that Child 2’s vision issues were attributable to the need to develop processing
skills, not an eye misalignment.

IV. RELEVANT EYE DISORDERS

A. Amblyopia

29. The American Academy of Ophthalmology (the “AAO”) describes
amblyopia as “an important public health problem because of its prevalence among
children and because visual impairment from amblyopia is lifelong and can be
und... With rare exception, amblyopia results in lifelong visual loss if it is untreated
or inadequately treated in early childhood.” AAO Preferred Practice Pattern (“PPP”)
Amblyopia, 2017.

30. The AAO PPP further states:

Treatment of refractive error alone can improve the visual acuity in children

who have untreated anisometropic and strabismic amblyopia. Visual acuity

of children who have bilateral refractive amblyopia also can substantially

improve with refractive correction alone. Additional treatment of patching

and atropine drops would not be indicated until amblyopia did not resolve
with the treatment of glasses alone.

31. Amblyopia, as determined by the AAO PPP, is a diagnosis based on best
corrected vision with more than a two-line or greater difference of optotype between the
eyes. In other words, if the difference between the vision in a child’s eyes is less than two
lines, the child does not have amblyopia.

B. Strabismus

32. If untreated or treated inadequately, strabismus may cause amblyopia.
