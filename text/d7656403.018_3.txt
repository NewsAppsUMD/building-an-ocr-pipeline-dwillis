On October 27, 2017, pursuant to the terms of the Consent Order, Dr.
Rajaratnam enrolled in MPRP. On November 8, 2017, Dr. Rajaratnam sent an email to
MPRP staff stating “i [sic] hereby revoke any consents made under duress.” MPRP
reported this to the Board as a “critical event.” On November 13, 2017, Dr. Rajaratnam
contacted Board staff, stating that he “dofes] not want to continue with renewal of [his]
Maryland Medical License.” On or around November 14, 2017, Dr. Rajaratnam was
instructed to schedule an appointment with Dr. A, a psychiatrist. On November 16,
2017, Dr. A contacted MPRP and informed MPRP staff that Dr. Rajaratnam stated that
he only wanted to meet with Dr. A to discuss professional issues and not personal
matters. Dr. A explained to Dr. Rajaratnam that a psychiatric evaluation could not be
restricted in that way. Dr. Rajaratnam did not schedule an appointment with Dr. A and
did not meet Dr. A. On November 17, 2017, MPRP closed Dr. Rajaratnam’s case for
cause. MPRP listed the following reasons for his discharge: “1) [Dr. Rajaratnam’s]
refusal to grant consent to correspond with treatment providers; 2) [his] lack of timely
responses; 3) dictating the terms of [his] psychiatric evaluation; and 4) continuing to
view our clinical case management process in a legal manner (for example, insisting on
recording our clinical meetings).”

On December 7, 2017, the Attorney General's Office issued a Violation of
Consent Order and Notice to Show Cause. On January 10, 2017, Disciplinary Panel A
held a Show Cause hearing at which Dr. Rajaratnam and his counsel appeared. At the
hearing, Dr. Rajaratnam argued that there were mitigating circumstances and asked
that his Consent Order be modified to permit him to continue his rehabilitation in

California. He stated that he would agree not to renew his license.
