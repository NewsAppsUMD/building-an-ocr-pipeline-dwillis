Individual D

16.

In October 2017, she first met the Respondent at a business
networking event. In subsequent meetings between October and
December 2017, the Respondent met with her privately and after
hours at the Practice as well as on drives in his car where he discussed
employment opportunities for her at the Practice, provided and

encouraged her to drink alcohol and made sexual advances towards
her.

In November 2017, the Respondent saw her as a patient and during
her appointment, kissed her and groped her left breast when the nurse
left the examination room.

In December 2017, she told the Respondent that she was not interested
in a romantic relationship with him and, thereafter, he no longer
discussed business opportunities at the Practice with her.

On May 8, 2020, Board investigators interviewed a human resources

employee at the Practice from March of 2018 until February of 2020 (“Individual D”). In

the under-oath interview, Individual D stated:

Shortly after she began working at the Practice, and during the course
of her employment, the Respondent made comments to her regarding
her physical appearance, invited her to have wine with him so they
could “get to know each other better and unwind,” initiated
conversations about sex and disclosed his sexual desires with her.

She told the Respondent that his behavior was inappropriate and made
her feel uncomfortable but the Respondent was “relentless.”
