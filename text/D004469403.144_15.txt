rehabilitation program. She also altered the date of her 2014 application to 2016 and contradicted
her sworn testimony to the Board on November 12, 2015 stating that she failed to disclose her
Virginia criminal history because she “thought the charges were going to be dismissed.” Dr.
Bailey’s culpability for her false answers on her applications to the Maryland and New York
licensing boards is not diminished by her obfuscation of the facts in her latest reply and her
“impression” that these boards were somehow aware of her guilty pleas and the information she
chose to withhold. In 2014, the Board had no knowledge of her 2013 guilty pleas to prescription
fraud in Virginia® and relied on the veracity of her answers.

Similarly, Dr. Bailey’s latest claim that MPRP was unfair in its statements of her non-
compliance in 2017 further underscores the contradictions between her admission in her June
2023 answer to the Board that she self-prescribed refill medications under a fictitious name while
enrolled in MPRP and her admissions of those criminal actions to MPRP and the Board in 2017.
In Dr, Bailey’s view, she fulfilled much of the MPRP testing and appointments, but her health
conditions prevented her full compliance. Her reply not only ignored MPRP’s concern that she
violated the most critical condition of her Rehabilitation Agreement not to self-prescribe or self-
treat but trivialized her violation. Her claim of unfairness by MPRP demonstrates that she
continues to minimize the criminal nature and illegality of her conduct.

Successive pediatric evaluation reports from 2016 to 2017 in Dr. Bailey’s MPRP records
also contradict her September 2023 reply regarding her pediatric employment. Although she
received an excellent employer evaluation rating on her October 2016 vocational report, the
subsequent quarterly reports, from December 2016 to May 2017, reveal a gradual and discernible
deterioration in Dr. Bailey’s punctuality, work performance and quality, stress management, and

5 In 2015, the Maryland General Assembly enacted § 14-308.1, a provision requiring a criminal history records
check (“CHRC”) by all applicants for licensure and reinstatement. See 2015 Md. Laws, § 2, ch. 34, Acts 2015.
