CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Panel B adopts the ALJ’s Proposed Default Order. Panel B finds Dr. Adams in default
based upon his failure to appear at the Office of Administrative Hearings for the prehearing
conference scheduled for January 9, 2017. See State Gov’t § 10-210(4). Based upon the
foregoing findings of fact, Panel B concludes that Dr. Adams is guilty of unprofessional conduct
in the practice of medicine, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii), and failed to cooperate
with a lawful investigation conducted by the Board or a disciplinary panel, in violation of Health
Occ. § 14-404(a)(33).

SANCTION

Panel B adopts the sanction recommended by the ALJ, which is to revoke Dr. Adams’s

medical license.
