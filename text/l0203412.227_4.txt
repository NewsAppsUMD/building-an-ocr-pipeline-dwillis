board’s review of the conduct of its licensee, the concept of moral turpitude is rather broad.”
Oltman v. Maryland State Bd. of Physicians, 162 Md. App. 457, 483 (2005).

Health Occ. § 14-5A-17(c) grants a disciplinary panel of the Board the authority and, at
the same time, gives the panel discretion to determine whether a crime involves moral turpitude
for licensing and disciplinary purposes. In Mr. Opoku’s case, the crime of fourth degree sex
offense does not, on its face, establish that the crime involves moral turpitude. In determining
whether this crime involves moral turpitude, Panel A must consider “the facts present in the
individual case at hand.” Walman, 280 Md. at 462.

The Court of Appeals has established that “[a] guilty plea is an admission of conduct that
constitutes all the elements of a formal criminal charge” and that “[b]y entering a plea of guilty,
the accused is not simply stating that he did the discrete acts described in the indictment; he is
admitting guilt of a substantive crime.” Metheny v. State, 359 Md. 576, 599 (2000) (internal
citations and quotation marks omitted). A guilty plea “also serves as a stipulation that no proof
by the prosecution need [be] advanced. . . . It supplies both evidence and verdict, [thus] ending
[the] controversy.” Jd.

Mr. Opoku entered a guilty plea to fourth degree sex offense. His conduct in engaging in
sexual contact with Health Care Worker A without her consent undermines the public’s
confidence in the respiratory care profession. See Stidwell v. Maryland State Bd. Of Chiropractic
Exam’rs, 144 Md. App. 613, 619 (2002) (a criminal offense that undermines the public’s
confidence in a profession may be a crime of moral turpitude if so determined by the appropriate
licensing board). Mr. Opoku’s admitted sexual assault of an employee at his workplace while he
was on duty working as a respiratory care practitioner meets the “base, vile, and shameful”

definition of moral turpitude. Jd.
