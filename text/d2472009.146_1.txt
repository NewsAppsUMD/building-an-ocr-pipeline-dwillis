BACKGROUND

1. At all times relevant, the Respondent was a physician licensed to practice
medicine in the State of Maryland. The Respondent was initially licensed in Maryland
on or about February 11, 1980, and his license is presently active through September
30, 2017.

2. The Respondent, trained as a cardiologist, is not board-certified. At all times
relevant, he practiced internal medicine and cardiology in a private practice with
locations in Bowie and Cheverly, Maryland, and held hospital privileges at two Prince
George’s County hospitals, Hospitals A and B.”

3. On or about May 13, 2016, the Board received a 10-day Mandated Report from
Hospital A (the “Report’) notifying the Board that the Respondent’s privileges had been
suspended on May 6, 2016 for 14 days because he “presented an imminent danger to
the health and safety” of Hospital A’s patients and staff, and his conduct interfered with
the orderly operations of Hospital A. The suspension was based on multiple complaints
that had been received alleging the Respondent had engaged in disruptive conduct with
patients and staff at Hospital A including berating staff and patients, disrupting orderly
hospital operations, inappropriately documenting personal complaints in patient records,
and inflicting pain on a patient by squeezing her wrist until she screamed, despite her
prior objection that his actions had caused pain to her wrist.

4. Based on the Report, the Board initiated an investigation, and on or about July

13, 2016, notified the Respondent and requested a written response to the allegations.

2 In order to maintain confidentiality, facility, patient and employee names will not be used in this
document, but will be provided to the Respondent on request.
