Dr. MacKoul estimated the weight before the pathologist weighed the fibroids, and his
records on the weight, after the pathologist weighed the fibroids, was consistent with the
pathologist report. The Panel agrees with Dr. Udoff that the exact number of fibroids was irrelevant
to the diagnosis. Additionally, as Dr. MacKoul points out, the photograph itself was a part of the
records, meaning that subsequent physicians could see for themselves the sizes and number of
fibroids. With respect to Patient 3, the Panel finds that Dr. MacKoul kept adequate medical
records.

B. Patients 1, 2, 4,5, 6, and 9

The ALJ did not find inadequate medical recordkeeping pertaining to Patients 1, 2, 4, 5, 6,
and 9. The AT.J found that the State’s expert’s testimony was conclusory. The State did not file
exceptions to these findings. The Panel adopts the ALJ’s finding that Dr. MacKoul did not keep
inadequate medical records for Patients 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9.

VI. Dr. MacKoul’s Statements to Patient 10

On December 2, 2015, Dr. MacKoul performed a myomectomy’ on Patient 10. Following
the procedure, Patient 10 was in pain. Patient 10 and her mother called Dr. MacKoul’s office
several times to express her pain. Dr. MacKoul prescribed Percocet and recommended ibuprofen
and Acetaminophen, but the patient continued to experience agonizing pain, and, on December 9,
2015, a week after the surgery, Patient 10 went to the emergency room at Hospital A, which
performed an x-ray and told Dr. MacKoul that they thought the patient had an abscess. Dr.
MacKoul transferred Patient 10 to Hospital B where he had privileges. When Dr. MacKoul first
entered the patient’s hospital room, he first stated to Patient 10 “This is overkill.” He then told

Patient 10 that he did not trust the doctors at Hospital A and that this was the first time something
