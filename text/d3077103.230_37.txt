Respondent not credible for the following reasons. The Respondent testified as follows:
Q. Aside from the Braintree research project, had you
provided medical services to [Individual A] in the last five

A. No, I have not.
Q, And what was the Braintree Project?
A, It was a clinical trial trying to show that a new

Individual A. Individual A’s name is indicated in plain English on the line that reads “Patient

indicate that a specimen was collected on July 22, 2016. In the lab result report, Individual A’s
name appears on the line that states “Patient Name.” The Respondent is identified as the
“Ordering Physician” and the document was electronically signed by the Respondent on July 25,
2016 (Bd. Ex. A2, p, 58). .

When Ms. Westphal, the Board Investigator, interviewed Individual A, she was
