Burke’s request to address the Panel at the DCCR may be interpreted as a request for a hearing,
Board Disciplinary Panel B (“Panel B”) declines to grant Dr. Burke’s request for a hearing
pursuant to the Code of Maryland Regulations (“COMAR”) 10.32.02.07E(3).°

Having reviewed and considered the entire record in this case, Panel: B issues this Final

Decision and Order.

FINDINGS OF FACT
Panel B finds the following:

1, On March 2, 2018, the grand jury in the Circuit Court for Harford County returned a
sixty-two count indictment against Dr. Burke, in case number 12-K-18-00271, charging
him with unlawful possession of a Controlled Dangerous Substance (“CDS”) and drug
paraphernalia, conspiracy to distribute CDS, distribution of CDS, and unlawfully

_ prescribing CDS outside of the standards of the provider’s profession.

2. On January 28, 2019, Dr. Burke entered into a negotiated plea agreement wherein he pled
guilty to five counts (counts 13, 16, 40, 47 and 59) of prescribing, administering,
manufacturing, distributing, dispensing, or possessing CDS not in the course of his
regular professional duties and not in conformance with Title 5 of the Criminal Law
Article and the standards of the profession, in violation of Crim. Law § 5-902(c).’ In
exchange for his plea of guilty, the remaining charges were dismissed.

 

has explained, the procedure is different for resolution of cases under Health Occ. § 14-404(a) and cases under
Health Occ. § 14-404(b) where there has already been an opportunity for a hearing and an adjudication on the
criminal charges, See Maryland Bd. of Phys. Quality Assurance vy, Felsenberg, 351 Md, 288, 292-95 (1998). Unlike
cases charged under Health Occ. § 14-404(a), a limited evidentiary hearing is discretionary for cases charged under
Health Oce, § 14-404(b). See infra, pp 4-S; COMAR 10.32.02.07E(3).

> In 2013, pursuant to Health Occ. § 14-401, the Board was divided into two disciplinary panels to resolve
disciplinary actions against physicians, See House Bill 1096, ch. 401, 2013 Md. Laws 3542, This case was
considered and decided by Disciplinary Panel B of the Board.
