The American Psychiatric Association: “The Principles of Medical Ethics” (2013
Edition).

Section 2

A physician shall uphold the standards of professionalism, be honest in all
professional interactions and strive to report physicians deficient in character or
competence, or engaging in fraud or deception to appropriate entities.

1. The requirement that the physician conduct himself/herself with
propriety in his or her profession and in all the actions of his or her
life is especially important in the case of the psychiatrist because the
patient tends to model his or her behavior after that of his or her
psychiatrist by identification. Further, the necessary intensity of the
treatment relationship may tend to activate sexual and other needs and
fantasies on the part of both patient and psychiatrist, while weakening
the objectivity necessary for control. Additionally, the inherent
inequality in the doctor-patient relationship may lead to exploitation

of the patient. Sexual activity with a current or former patient is
unethical.
