and careful that his/her conduct does not physically, sexually, psychologically, spiritually or
financially exploit or harm the patient.” APA Commentary on Ethics in Practice 3.1.1. If the
Board tolerated betrayal of patient trust by finding that a psychiatrist who discussed a patient’s
sensitive personal matters and began a sexual relationship with a patient’s spouse mere months
after the treatment sessions had ended was not a violation of Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3), it
would degrade the medical profession by reducing the trust that patients place in their providers,

the road for a few minutes and then took a longer ride with Patient 1’s wife to get ice cream that
took between one and two hours. During the car ride, with Patient 1’s wife successfully
separated from Patient 1, Dr. Singhal told Patient 1’s wife that he had a dream about her. When
they returned, Patient 1 was upset it had taken so long and said something to Dr. Singhal to
express his displeasure about the length of time it had taken. Dr. Singhal brushed off Patient 1’s

Both experts opined that this visit and the car ride with Patient. 1’s wife crossed
boundaries, but while the State’s expert found that this rose to the level of unprofessional

conduct in the practice of medicine, Dr. Singhal’s expert found it did not. The ALJ was more
