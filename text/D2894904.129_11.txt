Consent Order’s requirement that he permanently close his practice, however, was not contingent
on his selling the practice. Dr. Baltatzis’s attempt to downplay the nature of his violation is
disconcerting. The panel denies his exception.

Throughout his exceptions, Dr. Baltatzis also ignores the nature and extent of his
disciplinary history since 1993, and the multiple standard of care and record keeping deficiencies
identified by peer reviewers leading to disciplinary orders and corrective action in 1995, 1998,
2005, 2009, and 2015. He further ignores the Board’s decades-long interim efforts to re-educate
him on the core medical competencies directly relevant to his internal medicine practice, and
discounts his inability or unwillingness to improve his knowledge and skills in diagnosing and
treating common medical conditions, and in promoting preventive care. As is evident from the
2015 Consent Order, the type of standard of care violations identified during the many peer
reviews revealed that he could not or would not conform his medical care, treatment, and
documentation to appropriate professional standards, and that factor was foremost in the panel’s
considerations when it required him to permanently close his practice in May 2017. Dr.
Baltatzis’s unequivocal assurance that he would do so was the basis for the panel’s remarkable
forbearance in allowing him to retain his license in 2015. He did not permanently close his
practice in May 2017, or even make timely efforts to do so. Instead, he not only kept the practice
open way beyond the May 2017 deadline, but continued to see, treat and prescribe for patients,
and to engage in the practice of medicine.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Based on the findings of fact and discussion of Dr, Baltatzis’s exceptions, as set forth

above, Disciplinary Panel B concludes that Dr. Baltatzis violated the November 5, 2015 Consent

Order by failing to comply with a condition of that required him to permanently close his
