ORDER ON PETITION TO TERMINATE SUSPENSION

On May 18, 2022, Disciplinary Panel B (“Panel B”) of the Maryland State Board of
Physicians (the “Board”) charged Bernard Cohen, M.D., a pediatric dermatologist, with being
professionally, physically, or mentally incompetent, in violation of Md. Code Ann., Health Occ.
(“Health Occ.”) §14-404(a)(4). The charges were based on a March 22, 2022 evaluation (the
“March 2022 Evaluation”) that determined that his medical condition “almost certainly precludes
his ability to independently practice medicine.” !

On July 21, 2022, Dr. Cohen signed a Consent Order with Panel B to resolve the charges
against him wherein Panel B concluded that Dr. Cohen was professionally, physically, or mentally
incompetent. The Panel ordered the suspension of Dr. Cohen’s medical license and ordered Dr.
Cohen to undergo a comprehensive evaluation by the Maryland Professional Rehabilitation
Program (“MPRP”) to determine his fitness to practice medicine safely. The Consent Order further
provided that:

After the evaluation by MPRP and/or its agents is complete, the evaluation shall be

teviewed by Panel B. The parties may be required to appear before Panel B to

discuss whether the Respondent is fit to practice medicine and, if so, if probationary
conditions are necessary. If the disciplinary panel determines that it is safe for the

Respondent to return to the practice of medicine, the suspension will be terminated
through an order of Panel B and Panel B may impose any terms and conditions it

' For confidentiality reasons, the specific details and medical diagnoses contained in the reports
will not be disclosed in this document.
