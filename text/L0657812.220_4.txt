(“Panel A”) adopts these ALJ findings.

On October 26, 2020, the ALJ issued a Proposed Default Order, based upon the OAH
proceedings described above, which the ALJ recounted in the proposed order. The ALJ
proposed, pursuant to § 10-214(4) of the State Government Article and COMAR 28.02.01.23:

lL. that the Respondent be found in default;

2. that the factual allegations be found as factual findings;

3, that the Respondent be found to have violated Health Occ. § 14-5A-17(a)(1), (3),
(10), (26), and (28); and

4, that the Respondent’s license to practice respiratory care in Maryland be revoked.

Copies of the ALJ’s Proposed Default Order were mailed to the Respondent, the
Administrative Prosecutor, and the Board. The proposed order notified the parties that they may
file written exceptions to the proposed decision but must do so within 15 working days of the
date of the proposed order. Neither party filed exceptions.

The case came before Panel A for the final disposition.
