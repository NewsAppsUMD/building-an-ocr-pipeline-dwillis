Patient 1 was initially examined by the Respondent on or about November 21,
2012. Patient 1 presented with complaints of low back pain and had previously
undergone a surgical fusion of her sacroiliac joint.

The Respondent documented that Patient 1 had_left_posterior buttock/hip/groin
pain. The Respondent noted that Patient 1 had declined surgery in the past, but
“[a]t this time symptoms (sic) reduction may be achieved with [TFESI] procedure
to address the symptoms.”

At Patient 1’s initial office visit on November 21, 2012, the Respondent explained
the TFESI procedure to Patient 1, advising her that he would anesthetize her
during the procedure. Patient 1 had undergone previous spinal injections and
had found them to be very painful. She agreed to the Respondent's treatment
plan in large part because he represented that he would anesthetize her during
the procedure.

On November 21, 2012, Patient 1 was escorted to an examination room by a ,
staff person and was told to wait for the Respondent. Patient 1 remained in her
street clothes. A female chaperone was not present at any time during the
examination. While examining Patient 1’s back, the Respondent instructed
Patient 1 to lower her pants. The Respondent, who was not wearing gloves,
separated the cheeks of Patient 1’s buttocks and “went inside [Patient 1’s]
behind,” but did not digitally penetrate her anus . The Respondent then reached
around and came close to, but did not touch Patient 1’s vagina. The Respondent
did not explain to Patient 1 what he was doing or the purpose of this type of

examination.
