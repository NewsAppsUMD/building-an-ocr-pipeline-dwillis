29. On November 30, 2020, the Board received Complainant 2’s second complaint

Respondent examined her lower back.

Complaint 4, filed by Complainant 2 (Other Comments and Behavior
that the Respondent Subjected Complainant 2 to)

30. Complainant 2 took maternity leave sometime after the Respondent’s examination
of her back. When she returned to work, the Respondent told her how good she looked after just
giving birth. He also asked her how her sex life was after having the baby. She kept her answers
short, saying it was fine and everything was great.

31. On one occasion when Complainant 2 mistakenly handed the Respondent’s small

blade to him he told her to hand him the big blade, saying that he is a big boy and that she would

prefer his big boy over her husband. Complainant 2 interpreted the comment comparing a surgical —

instrument to male genitalia.

32. Around Halloween one year, the Respondent showed Complainant 2 a photo ofa
sexy nurse costume and suggested she buy and wear it for Halloween. She responded that the
costume was not her style or taste.

33. On another occasion, the Respondent commented on Complainant 2’s bra and bra
strap, saying that it must be her favorite one because she wore it often.

34. On one occasion, the Respondent followed Complainant 2 out of the OR toward
the front desk. In proximity to the OR secretary, the Respondent said that he wanted to take

Complainant 2 over his knee and spank her.
