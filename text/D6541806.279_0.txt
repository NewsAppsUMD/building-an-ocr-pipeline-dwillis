Re: Vitalis Ojiegbe, M.D.
Case No.: 2219-0113
License No.: D65418

Dear Dr. Ojiegbe and Counsel:

On June 18, 2019, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued
an ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE in
this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2018
Supp.). Dr. Ojiegbe was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing before
Disciplinary Panel B to show cause why that suspension should not be continued on June 26,
2019. Prior to the scheduled hearing Dr. Ojiegbe’s counsel, Mr. Dunne, contacted the Board and
stated that Dr. Ojiegbe waived his right to the post-deprivation hearing. Due to the waiver, Panel
B did not hold a post-deprivation hearing in this matter, the summary suspension continues, and
the parties may proceed to the summary suspension appeal. COMAR 10.32.02.08E.

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board’s regulations, Dr. Ojiegbe has the right to request a full evidentiary
hearing before an Administrative Law Judge. This request will be granted if the Board receives
a written request for a hearing within TEN (10) days of the date of this letter. Any request for a
hearing should be sent to Christine A. Farrelly, Executive Director, at the Board’s address. If
such a hearing is requested, the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set the
hearing to begin within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08 I, though that 30-day
requirement may be waived.
