The ALJ did not believe Dr. Smith’s claim that the relationship had ended before his
personal and sexual relationship began. Neither does the Panel. The Panel finds that Dr. Smith
began treating Patient B in 1998, began a sexual relationship with Patient B in 2005, and that his
sexual relationship and the physician-patient relationship overlapped. The documentary
evidence, Dr. Smith’s own testimony, and Dr. Smith’s prior statements to the Program and
subsequent letter to the Board indicate that the sexual relationship was concurrent with his
treatment of Patient B.

Regarding the documentary evidence, Dr. Smith never issued a discharge letter to Patient
B and Dr. Smith’s medical records from Patient B’s last visit indicated an intent that she would
return for care for a follow-up visit to review laboratory test results. Nothing in the records
suggested that her treatment ended. Further, the medical records were incomplete because, in
2013, Dr. Smith “thinned” his file.

Dr. Smith himself testified that he refilled prescriptions for long term therapies for Patient
B even after their sexual relationship began.

Dr. Smith’s claim that his professional relationship with Patient B ended prior to the
sexual relationship was also inconsistent with his prior statements to the Program. In his
interview with the Program on March 4, 2020, Dr. Smith admitted that his sexual relationship
began in “2005 and continued until 2007 while she was still a patient of his.” In a letter, dated
August 20, 2020, the Board sought additional clarification from Dr. Smith regarding the
relationship. On August 27, 2020, Dr. Smith sent a response letter to the Board where he
claimed that the social friendship began shortly after 2000, and then five years later became “an
occasional intimate relationship that extended over two years. . . . I continued to see her

occasionally as a patient thereafter.”
