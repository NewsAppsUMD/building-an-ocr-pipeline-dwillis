Standard of Care

45. The standard of care for a patient twenty-eight weeks pregnant with an
intrauterine fetal death is to refer that patient to a facility with a higher level of care, such a
surgical facility or a hospital, because the patient faces a higher risk of infection, excessive
bleeding, uterine rupture, and other complications, and the potential need for surgical
intervention if there were difficulty delivering the fetus.

46. The Respondent violated the standard of care by performing a medically induced
abortion on Patient A in his medical office instead of referring her to a higher level of care

facility.
