FINDINGS OF FACT

In his written exceptions, Dr. Hill does not take exception to the ALJ’s Proposed
Findings of Fact. The ALJ found that Dr. Hill intentionally answered falsely that he did not have
pending charges in his license renewal application. Further, it is undisputed that the Virginia
Board disciplined Dr. Hill for various violations of the Virginia practice act. The Panel adopts
