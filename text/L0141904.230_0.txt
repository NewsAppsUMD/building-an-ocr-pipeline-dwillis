Case No.: 7720-0062
License No.: L01419

Dear Mr. Dailey and Mr. Brown:

On April 8, 2020, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians issued
an ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE in
this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Goy’t § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl. Vol.). On April
22, 2020, Mr. Dailey was given an opportunity to attend a hearing before Disciplinary Panel B to
show cause why that suspension should not be continued. Mr. Dailey attended the hearing on
that date. The State was represented by Michael Brown, Assistant Attorney General,
Administrative Prosecutor. Both parties presented oral arguments at the post-deprivation
hearing.

After considering these arguments at the hearing and the investigative file, Disciplinary
Panel B determined that there exists a substantial risk of serious harm to the public health, safety
or welfare in Mr. Dailey’s continued practice. Disciplinary Panel B thus will not lift the
summary suspension order and the summary suspension imposed on April 8, 2020 is reaffirmed
and continues. See COMAR 10.32.02.08H(1).

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, Mr. Dailey has the right to request a full evidentiary hearing
before an Administrative Law Judge at the Office of Administrative Hearings. This request will
be granted if the Board receives a written request for the hearing within TEN (10) days of the
date of this letter. Any request for a hearing should be sent to Christine A. Farrelly, Executive
