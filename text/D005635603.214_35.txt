1. STATE’S EXCEPTIONS

A. Whether the Respondent Posed a Continuing Danger Requiring
the Order for Summary Suspension

The State took exception to the ALJ’s finding that the Respondent did not pose a danger
at the time the order for summary suspension was issued. The crux of the ALJ’s decision is that
any real danger the Respondent may have posed had disappeared by the time the order for
summary suspension was issued. The ALJ found that there is no evidence of the Respondent’s
misconduct after he was issued a Letter of Reprimand from the Hospital, demonstrating, to the
ALJ, that the Letter of Reprimand by the Hospital was sufficient to suppress any threat of serious
harmful conduct by the Respondent. There are, however, a number of flaws in the ALJ’s
proposed finding.

To support the finding that the order for summary suspension was not imperatively
required, the ALJ attempted to distinguish the Mullan case. Board of Physician Quality
Assurance v, Mullan, 381 Md. 157, 173 (2004). In Mullan, the Board summarily suspended the
license of a pediatrician, Dr. Mullan, because Dr. Mullan treated patients while intoxicated. Id.
at 161. The Court of Appeals affirmed the summary suspension. Jd. at 173. The ALJ’s
reasoning in the Respondent’s case was that no new allegations of wrongdoing after the Letter of
Reprimand was issued demonstrated no continuing danger. The ALJ contrasted that to Mullan,
finding that, in Mudlan, unlike in the Respondent’s case, “there was no evidence that the situation
had been ameliorated in any way.” (ALJ’s Proposed Decision (“PD”) at 13.) In Mullan,
however, there was only one episode of proven wrongdoing, which was that, on one day, April
10, 2000, Dr. Mullan treated patients while intoxicated. There were no complaints of Dr. Mullan

treating patients while intoxicated other than the one complaint about April 10, 2000, which
