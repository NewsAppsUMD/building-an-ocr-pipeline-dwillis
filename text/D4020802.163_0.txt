License Number: D40208
Case Number: 7723-0001

Dear Dr, Freas and Members of Disciplinary Panel B:

Please be advised that, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. (“Health Occ.”)
§14-403 (2021 Repl. Vol.), I have decided to SURRENDER my license to practice
medicine in the State of Maryland, License Number D40208, effective immediately. I
understand that upon surrender of my license, I may not practice medicine, with or
without compensation, in the State of Maryland as it is defined in the Maryland Medical
Practice Act (the “Act”), Health Occ. §§ 14-101 et seg. and other applicable laws. In
other words, as of the effective date of this Letter of Surrender, I understand that the
surrender of my license means that I am in the same position as an unlicensed individual
in the State of Maryland.

I understand that this Letter of Surrender is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT, and upon
Disciplinary Panel B’s (“Panel B”) acceptance, becomes a FINAL ORDER of Panel B
of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”),

I acknowledge that the Board opened an investigation based upon a complaint
received from the Maryland Office of Controlled Substances Administration (‘OCSA”)
which alleged that I inappropriately prescribed controlled dangerous substances. On
January 21, 2022, Panel B issued charges alleging that I failed to meet appropriate
standards as determined by appropriate peer review for the delivery of quality medical

location in this State; and failed to keep adequate medical records as determined by
appropriate peer review[.], in violation of Health Occ.§ 14-404(a)(22) and (40). As a
resolution to the charges, I entered into a Consent Order with Panel B on July 12, 2022,
that concluded, as a matter of law, that I violated the disciplinary grounds alleged, Health
Oce.§ 14-404(a)(22) and (40). The Consent Order reprimanded my license to practice
medicine in. the State of Maryland, placed me on probation for a minimum of two (2)
