Farrelly, Executive Director, at the Boardâ€™s address. If Dr. Rustagi requests such a hearing, the
regulations require that the Office of Administrative Hearings schedule a hearing within 30 days
of the request for hearing, but Dr. Rustagi may waive the 30-day requirement. See COMAR
10.32.02.08 I.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel B resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely yours,
