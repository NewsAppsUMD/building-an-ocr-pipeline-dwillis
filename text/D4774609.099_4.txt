circumstances that led to his guilty plea at the DCCR scheduled for September 25, 2019.°
Consideration of mitigating factors, however, is prohibited by the Board’s regulations. See
COMAR 10.32.02.04E(2)(d). This prohibition also comports with the intent of the statute to
“direct{] summary treatment of a charge based on the conviction of a crime of moral turpitude.”
Felsenberg, 351 Md. at 288. The only issue for Panel B to resolve, therefore, is whether
prescribing CDS not in the course of regular professional duties and not in conformance with

Crime of Moral Turpitude

Health Occ. §14-404(b)(2) mandates the automatic revocation of a physician’s medical
license when a disciplinary panel concludes that a physician was convicted of a crime involving
moral turpitude. “Ordinarily, the question [of whether a crime involves moral turpitude] arises in
the case of witnesses who have been convicted of infamous crimes or those involving moral
turpitude and whose credibility is impeached by the asking whether they have been so
convicted.” Board of Dental Exam’rs v. Lazzell, 172 Md. 314 (1937). Accordingly, in defining
the concept of moral turpitude, “‘it is settled that whatever else it may mean, it includes fraud
and that a crime in which an intent to defraud is an essential element is a crime involving moral

turpitude.’” Oltman v. Maryland State Bd. of Physicians, 162 Md. App. 457, 486 (2005)
(quoting Attorney Grievance Comm’n of Md. v. Walman, 280 Md, 453, 459-60 (1977))
(emphasis in original),

Under Health Occ. §14-404(b)(2), a disciplinary panel has the obligation to determine
what types of crimes are crimes of moral turpitude for licensing and disciplinary purposes.
