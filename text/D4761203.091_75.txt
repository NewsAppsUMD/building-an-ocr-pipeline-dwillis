The weights” of the uteri removed from the suture patients were as follows:
Patient 1 - 184 grams (Bd. Ex. 7, at PM 3672)
Patient 2 - 620 grams (Bd. Ex. 11, at PM 3762)
Patient 4-155 grams (Bd. Ex. 17, at PM 4063)
Patient 5-150 grams (Bd. Ex. 19, at PM 4118)
Patient 6 - 43.9 grams (Bd. Ex. 22, at PM 4204)
Patient 9 - 459 grams (Bd Ex. 31, at PM 4392)

With the exception of Patient 6, all uteri are at least twice the weight of an average
seventy gram uterus. Looking at this data from the suture patients and assuming the
Respondent’s contract with CareFirst allowed him to bill code 37617 for larger uteri at the ASC,
or when just performing procedures at the ASC, the Respondent appears to have, in general,
appropriately billed code 37617. The language of the Respondent’s contract with CareFirst
seems to allow him leeway with regard to making informed medical decisions in the best
interests of his patients. However, per the contract, those decisions are subject to review and veto
by CareFirst. |

At the hearing, the State, on cross examination, questioned both the Respondent and Ms.
Welter concerning a peer review CareFirst performed in 2015 of the Respondent’s billing of
code 37617 (2015 peer review). The State alleged that as a result of the 2015 peet review,
CareFirst ultimately denied billing for code 37617. Both Ms. Welter and the Respondent denied
knowledge of the 2015 peer review one way or another. I did not find their testimony on this
issue credible. Ms. Welter performed her “look back” in 2016. I do not find it credible that the
look back-would not reveal the presence (or absence) of the 2015 peer review. The Respondent

testified clearly and concisely about his billing practices and procedures. However, when
