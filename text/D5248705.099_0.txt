Re: Surrender of License to Practice Medicine
Paul R. Johnson, M.D. License Number: D52487 (expired)
Case Number: 2219-0012B

Dear Dr. Freas and Members of the Disciplinary Panel B,

Please be advised that, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. (“Health Occ.”)
§14-403 (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2018 Supp.), I have decided to SURRENDER my license to
practice medicine in the State of Maryland, License Number D52487,' effective
immediately. I understand that upon surrender of my license, I may not give medical advice
or treatment to any individual, with or without compensation, and cannot prescribe
medications or otherwise engage in the practice of medicine in the State of Maryland as it
is defined in the Maryland Medical Practice Act (the “Act”), Health Occ. §§ 14-101 ef seq.
and other applicable laws. In other words, as of the effective date of this Letter of
Surrender, I understand that the surrender of my license means that I am in the same
position as an unlicensed individual in the State of Maryland.

I understand that this Letter of Surrender is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT, and upon
Disciplinary Panel B’s (“Panel B”) acceptance, becomes a FINAL ORDER of Panel B of
the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board”).

I acknowledge that on or about July 10, 2018, and August 31, 2018, the Board
received a Mandated 10-Day Report from Hospital A notifying the Board that my
privileges had been summarily suspended on June 29, 2018, based on a patient incident
involving a patient safety issue. In lieu of appealing the suspension of my hospital

' My license expired on September 30, 2018; however, pursuant to Health Occ. §14-403, unless a
disciplinary panel agrees to accept the surrender of a license, the individual may not surrender a license
while the individual is under investigation.
