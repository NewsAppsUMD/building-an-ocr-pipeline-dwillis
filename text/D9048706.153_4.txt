Physician Supervisor

14. On May 17, 2023, Board staff conducted an under-oath interview of a
physician (“Physician Supervisor”) who deals with issues regarding the medical staff at the
Facility.

15. The Physician Supervisor met with the Respondent. The Respondent
admitted that she had been using controlled dangerous substances for three to four months
and admitted to diverting the medication. The Respondent specifically admitted to using
Dilaudid, Fentanyl, Versed and Propofol. The Respondent stated that she would provide
the patient with what was needed and save the remaining medication in a clean syringe and
use it at a later time. The Respondent would then inject saline in the syringe to make it
appear that the medication was being properly discarded pursuant to the proper waste
procedures. |

16. The Respondent submitted a one-year leave of absence from the Facility.
Respondent’s Admission

17. The Board notified the Respondent of its investigation by letter dated April
26, 2023 and directed her to provide a written response.

18. By letter dated May 11, 2023, the Respondent, through counsel, provided a
written response to the Board.

19. In the response, the Respondent admits that “when she collapsed during a
procedure on March 20, 2023, she was found with a syringe and IV catheter attached to
her foot.” The Respondent “acknowledges and understands that there is no excuse for such

behavior - especially while providing patient care.”
