Dr. McLean’s criminal violations also undermine the public’s confidence in the medical
profession. See Stidwell v. Maryland State Board of Chiropractic Examiners, 144 Md. App. 613,
619 (2002)(a criminal offense that undermines the public’s confidence in a profession may be a
crime of moral turpitude if so determined by the appropriate licensing board). In addition, Dr.
McLean’s repeated fraudulent billing was “an act of baseness, vileness, or depravity in the
private and social duties which man owes to his fellow man, or to society in general, contrary to
the accepted and customary rule of right and duty between man and man.” Board of Dental
Examiners v. Lazell, 172 Md. 314, 320 (1937). In the panel’s view, Dr. McLean’s exploitation of
a health care plan to this extent, as well as the long-standing and repetitive nature of his criminal
conduct, disparaged professional principles, and were a disgrace to the medical profession.
Under any definition of the term of Maryland law, Dr. McLean’s crime constituted a crime of
moral turpitude, in violation of H.O. §14-404(b)(2).
