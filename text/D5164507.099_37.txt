First, the Respondent did not invite Person 1 to his office.on the day of the fight. Person
| arrived angry; she wanted money from the Respondent and to confront him about his
“infidelity.”

Second, Person 1 made it clear to the Respondent that she was “fed-up” with ‘him; she
was ready “to kill or be killed” and to “fuck{]” him up.

Third, upon learning Person 1 ‘was in the office, the Respondent ushered her into the
stairwell, away from his office and possible contact with patients, This action protected his
patients and staff. ,

Fourth, after the fight in the stairwell, the Respondent sought assistance fom the
building’s security staff, He also instructed Ms. White to call 911. These actions are
inconsistent with that of an aggressor, but fully consistent with the behavior of a victim.

‘Finally, the policeman who arrived at the scene only placed Person 1 in handcuffs
because she was out of control and aggressive: the Respondent was calm.

Despite the disparity in the injuries between the Person 1 and the Respondent, and the
disconnect between the Respondent’s description of his relatively subdued behavior and Person
1’s injuries, I find that it is more likely than not that Person 1 was the aggressor. Moreover, I
find that the Respondent attempt to protect patients and his staff from what he had good reason
to believe might be an ugly scene.

Payment to Patient 1 for babysitting Person 1’s children

Ms. Miller accurately testified that Patient 1 stated in her interview that that the

Respondent paid her up to $250.00 to babysit Person 1’s children while Person 1 did video
_ shoots for the Respondent, Person 1 testified that the Respondent paid Patient 1 to babysit her
children whenever she went out with the Respondent. During the Board’s interview and at the

hearing, the Respondent specifically denied that he paid Patient 1 to babysit Person 1’s children.
