Complainant to have “endless” meetings with him in attempts to rectify the Respondent’s
late submission of reports.

alcohol problem about three-to-four years ago when the Respondent collapsed in the office
and had to be hospitalized for alcohol abuse and malnutrition. The Complainant stated that
after this hospitalization, the Respondent was rehospitalized for alcohol abuse after he
collapsed in the office.

involving loss of a bodily function when the Respondent was treating a patient in the office,
requiring the Facility to close the office in order to clean it.

16. The Complainant stated that he wanted to help the Respondent and offered
to buy him new clothes, go to Alcoholics Anonymous with him and handle his finances for
him. The Complainant stated that he did this so that the Respondent “didn't have extra
money to get himself in trouble.” In addition, the Complainant stated that he counseled the
Respondent on a weekly basis and questioned the Respondent if he was drinking while
working, which the Respondent denied. The Complainant expressed safety concerns about
the Respondent, stating that he required an assistant to be present in the room when the
Respondent was with a patient. The Complainant also stated that the Respondent had
attendance problems when he was scheduled to work.

be taking care of patients and has concerns about the Respondent’s ability to practice

medicine safely, stating, “J wouldn’t send anyone I know to him.”
