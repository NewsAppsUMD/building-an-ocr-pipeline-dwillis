lack of competency based on his | abilities to practice medicine rather than any
diagnosis label.

Dr. Dabela speculates that if there were true concerns about his mental status or
competence at least one patient, employee, staff member, referring physician, or family member
would have reported their concerns. The Panel rejects this supposition. Dr. S, an expert evaluator
deemed Dr. Dabela not competent to practice medicine. A lack of additional complaints does not
alter the potential for patient harm, The Panel does not have to wait for patient harm to occur in
order to act. See Pickert v. Maryland Bd. of Physicians, 180 Md. App. 490, 505 (2008) (“No
proof of injury or harm is required to take disciplinary actions against a physician’s license.”).
Based on the reports of the experts and Dr. Dabela’s own testimony, the nature of Dr. Dabela’s
impairments indicate that he cannot practice medicine safely.

Dr. Dabela’s Partner

Dr. Dabela takes exception to the ALJ’s finding that the testimony of Dr. Dabela’s
partner was immaterial to the proposed conclusions and disposition in the case. He argues that
the ALJ ignored his partner’s testimony and that the ALJ failed to consider Dr. Dabela’s
partner’s ulterior motive because his business partner stood to gain financially by filing a
complaint with the Board regarding Dr. Dabela’s competency. The ALJ did, however, consider
that Dr. Dabela’s partner might have filed the complaint against Dr. Dabela to take over the
medical practice for one dollar. The ALJ stated, “Even if [Dr. Dabela’s partner] did, in fact,
fabricate the allegation that the Respondent is no longer competent to care for patients due to
ma impairment, the State has presented independent, credible evidence that the
Respondent has | which renders him unsafe to continue in the practice of medicine.” The

Panel agrees with the ALJ. Regardless of the reason the complaint was filed, the Board
