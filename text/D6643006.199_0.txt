Re: Surrender of License to Practice Medicine
Craig Wilder, M.D., License Number: D66430
Case Number: 2219-0001B

Dear Dr. Freas and Members of Board Disciplinary Panel B,

Please be advised that, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 14-403 (2014
Repl. Vol. & 2017 Supp.), I have decided to SURRENDER my license to practice
medicine in the State of Maryland, License Number D66430, effective upon the signature
of the Executive Director of the Maryland State Board of Physicians (the “Board’”). I
understand that upon surrender of my license, | may not give medical advice or treatment
to any individual, with or without compensation, and cannot prescribe medications or
otherwise engage in the practice of medicine in the State of Maryland as it is defined in the
Maryland Medical Practice Act (the “Act”), Health Occ. §§ 14-101 ef seg. and other
applicable laws. In other words, as of the effective date of this Letter of Surrender, I
understand that the surrender of my license means that I am in the same position as an
unlicensed individual in the State of Maryland.

I understand that this Letter of Surrender is a PUBLIC DOCUMENT, and upon
Disciplinary Panel B’s (“Panel B”) acceptance, becomes a FINAL ORDER of Panel B of
the Board.

I acknowledge that, and, on March 15, 2019, Panel B issued disciplinary charges
against me under Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(1) (fraudulently or deceptively obtains... a
license for the applicant), (3)(ii) (is guilty of unprofessional conduct in the practice of
medicine), and (36) (willfully makes a false representation when seeking or making
application for licensure). Specifically, Panel B alleged that I falsely answered “no” on my
August 17, 2017 license renewal application filed with the Board to the question asking
whether a licensing board had investigated me for any reason. Additionally, I was charged
with violating Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(21) (is disciplined by a licensing authority for an
act that would be grounds for disciplinary action under this section), specifically with
grounds (3)(ii), (22) (fails to meet appropriate standards for the delivery of quality medical
care), and (40) (fails to keep adequate medical records). A copy of the charges is attached
