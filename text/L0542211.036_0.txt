Case No.: 2016-0916A
License No.: L05422

Dear Ms. Bloomfield and Ms. Rubin:

On October 18, 2016, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t II, § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014
Repl. Vol.). On November 2, 2016, Ms. Bloomfield was given an opportunity to attend a hearing
before Disciplinary Panel A to show cause why the suspension should not be continued. Ms.
Bloomfield attended the hearing on that date and the State was represented by Dawn Rubin,
Assistant Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor. Both parties were in agreement that the
summary suspension should be continued at this time.

After considering the presentations at the hearing and the investigative file, Disciplinary
Panel A determined that Ms. Bloomfield’s continued practice would present a substantial risk of
serious harm to the public health, safety or welfare and, therefore, affirmed the summary
suspension imposed on October 18, 2016. Disciplinary Panel A, through its counsel, advised Ms.
Bloomfield of this decision orally on the hearing date.

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Ms. Bloomfield has the right to request a full evidentiary hearing before an
Administrative Law Judge. This request will be granted if the Board receives a written request
for the hearing within ten days of the date of this letter. Any request for a hearing should be sent
to Christine Farrelly, Executive Director, at the Board’s address. If Ms. Bloomfield requests such
a hearing, the regulations require that the Office of Administrative Hearings schedule a hearing
