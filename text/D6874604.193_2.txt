From in and around spring 2013 and continuing through at least
early-2016, in the Eastern District of Virginia and elsewhere, RALEY
knowingly and willfully did combine, conspire, confederate and agree with
... others, known and unknown, to commit the following offenses against
the United States: (1) violating Title 42, United States Code, Section 1320a-
7(b)(1)(A), by knowingly and willfully soliciting or receiving remuneration
in return for referring patients to specific pharmacies for the furnishing,
and/or arranging for the furnishing, of items and services for which payment
was made, in whole or in part, under a Federal health care program, namely
TRICARE, Medicare, and Medicaid; and (2) violating Title 18, United
States Code, Section 1343, by knowingly and with the intent to defraud,
devising and intending to devise, a scheme and artifice to defraud insurance
companies and for obtaining money and property by means of materially
false and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises; transmitting
and causing to be transmitted by means of wire communication in interstate
commerce, certain writings, signs, signals, and sounds for the purpose of
executing the scheme or artifice.

[As detailed more specifically in the statement of facts,] RALEY
and [ ] entered into agreements with pharmacies to send prescriptions for
lucrative compound medications to the pharmacies and agreements with
durable medical equipment (“DME”) companies to utilize specific
companies’ DME in surgeries in exchange for payments from these
companies, which represented significant percentages of the profits these
companies were receiving from federal health benefit programs, ie.,
impermissible kickbacks. At all relevant times, RALEY knew that these
pharmacies and DME companies were submitting claims to federal health
benefit programs for payment for the prescriptions or the DME, and that
paying or receiving kickbacks violated the terms of the agreements these
companies had with the federal health benefit programs and/or the
prescription benefits managers (“PBMs”) that administered the programs
on the federal health benefit programs’ behalf. At all relevant times,
RALEY also knew that this conduct was prohibited by federal law.

In total, RALEY agrees that [ ] it was reasonably foreseeable to him
that the conspiracy generated a net profit of approximately $2,914,197.77
from payments made by TRICARE for compound prescriptions to [ ].

4. On November 18, 2022, the Court sentenced Dr. Raley to thirty-six months of
incarceration, to commence after January |, 2023, followed by three years of
supervised release. |
