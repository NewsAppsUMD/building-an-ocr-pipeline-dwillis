 

7. Amblyopia, commonly referred to as “lazy eye,” is a disorder of sight in
which the brain fails to process inputs from one eye and over time favors the other eye,
resulting in decreased vision.

8. Parent 1 alleged that the Respondent advised that Patient 1’s right eye was
dominant and he would lose his sight in his left eye if the right eye was not patched
(occlusion therapy) or treated with atropine drops (atropine penalization) to dilate the eye.

9. Atropine drops weaken the focusing mechanism of the stronger eye, reducing
the near vision to such an extent that the child’s brain “chooses” the image from the
amblyopic eye rather than the biurred image from the stronger eye. The therapeutic goal
of atropine penalization is to improve the visual acuity of the amblyopic eye.

10. Parent 1 further alleged that in 2017, the Respondent diagnosed Patient 1
with strabismus.

11, Strabismus, a condition commonly referred to as “cross-eyed,” is a problem
with eye alignment, in which both eyes do not look at the same place at the same time.

12. The Respondent advised that Patient 1’s left eye was now dominant and
needed to be corrected because his eyes were not lining up correctly.

13. The Respondent placed prisms in Patient 1’s glasses to treat his diagnosis of
strabismus.

14. | The Respondent increased the prism strength at regular intervals from two
prism diopters to 15 prism diopters.

15. Parent 1 alleged that the Respondent was planning to perform surgery on

Patient 1’s right eye to fix the muscle in place once the prisms corrected his right eye.
