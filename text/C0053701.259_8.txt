INADEQUATE MEDICAL RECORDKEEPING
12. The peer reviewer found the Respondent's record keeping was inadequate for
eight patients (Patients 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10), for reasons in whole or in part as follows:
e The Respondent failed to accurately list current medications the patient was
being prescribed (Patients 1, 2);

mental health providers to justify the diagnoses documented as rationales
for prescribing CDS (Patients 1, 2, 4, 5, 10);
e The Respondent failed to adequately document the patient’s progress on
the medication regimen (Patients 6);
e The Respondent failed to document an adequate evaluation of the patient
including the subjective symptoms (Patients 6, 7, 9, 10); and/or
e The Respondent used a repetitive chronic low back care plan although the
complaint was not complaining of back pain (Patient 7).
13. The Respondent's actions and inactions as outlined in pertinent part above in

Health Occ. § 15-314(a)(40).
