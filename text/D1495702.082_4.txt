‘he will not later be heard to complain that the evidence should not have been admitted.’” Rosov
v. Maryland State Bd. of Dental Exam’rs, 163 Md. App. 98, 112 (2005) (quoting Ginn v. Farley,
43 Md. App. 229, 236-37 (1979)). See also Swoboda v. Wilder, 173 Md. App. 615, 641 (2007)
(“the Protestants did not object to the testimony of [the witness] and therefore waived their
objection to the Board’s consideration of it”); Maryland Rule 4-323 (“An objection to the
admission of evidence shall be made at the time the evidence is offered or as soon thereafter as
the grounds for objection become apparent. Otherwise the objection is waived.”). Based on Dr.
Smith’s failure to object during the hearing at OAH, the Panel finds that he has waived any
claims regarding insufficient notice regarding the advisory letters and the testimony regarding
treatment of Patient B’s husband. |

Even if the Panel considered these arguments, the Panel would find that the State
complied with the necessary requirements for notice. The standards for notice are set forth in
State Gov’t § 10-207, which states that an “agency shall give reasonable notice of the agency’s
action,” and the notice shall, among other things “state concisely and simply the facts that are
asserted” or “the issues that are involved.” State Gov’t § 10-207(a)(b)(1)(i) & (ii). In Reed y.
Baltimore, 323 Md. 175, 184 (1991), the Court held that the notice requirement should be “in
sufficient detail to enable the [party] to marshal evidence and arguments in defense of the
assertions.” In Regan v. Board of Chiropractic Examiners, 355 Md. 397, 420 (1997), the Court
of Appeals explained that the “gist of the charges” has to mirror the “gist of the Board’s
findings.”

Here, the Board’s finding of a violation is not based on the advisory letters and the
treatment of Patient B’s husband. Rather, Dr. Smith was found in violation due to his

prescribing to family members, his sexual relationship with Patient B, and his false statement
