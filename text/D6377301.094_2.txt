follow-up care with the Respondent. The Complainant stated that the Respondent
improperly filled out the Patient’s insurance paperwork, necessitating the Patient to return
for a follow-up visit to correct the error. When the Patient brought the error to the
Respondent’s attention, the Respondent became “furious and belittled [the Patient’s] well-
being and instability.” The Complainant referred to the Respondent’s conduct as being
“unethical and inhumane.”

Board Investigation

6. As part of its investigation, the Board obtained the Respondent’s written
response to the Complaint, interviewed the Respondent, reviewed documents the
Respondent submitted to the Board, obtained a portion of the Respondent’s medical
records, and referred the Respondent for an evaluation after the Respondent acted in an
aberrant manner during the investigation.

Respondent’s written response

7. By letter dated March 1, 2023, the Board notified the Respondent that a
complaint had been filed against her and that it had opened a preliminary investigation into
the matter. The Board provided the Respondent with a copy of the complaint and requested
that she address the Complaint in a written response.

8. By email to the Board dated March 13, 2023, the Respondent submitted her
written response to the allegations that were set forth in the Complaint. The Respondent’s
response was incoherent and did not directly address her behavior toward the Patient.
When commenting on her documentation, the Respondent stated, “Didn’t realize how

sparse my note was until I looked at it.”
