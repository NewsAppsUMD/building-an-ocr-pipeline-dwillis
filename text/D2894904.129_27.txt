take oxygen onto a commercial airplane; all he did for Patient D was to sign the form
reauthorizing his CPAP machine. According to the Respondent, he did not have to examine
either patient to sign those forms and he did not examine them when they came in because he
was aware he was not allowéd to practice under the Consent Order.

The Respondent argued he made a “good faith effort” to close his practice. He had the
intent to comply with the Consent Order and he attempted to comply with the Consent Order by
hiring Dr. | work in a transitional capacity and by making arrangements with ia
to sell the practice to her. The Respondent conceded the possibility he committed a “technical
violation” of the Consent Order, He argued that to the extent it was only a technical violation,
it does not rise to a level which requires the revocation of his license. The Respondent
recommended a dismissal of the charges.

The Consent Order is, as the State correctly noted, direct and unambiguous. It provided

that the Respondent “shall ... permanently close his practice in May 2017 and ... shall provide to
