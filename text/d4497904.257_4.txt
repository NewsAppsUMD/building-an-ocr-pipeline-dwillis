Respondent. These results constitute violations of the “Consent for
Chronic Opioid Therapy” agreements each patient signed when
initiating treatment with the Respondent; however, the Respondent
failed to take appropriate action to address results that were
inconsistent with her prescribed regimen. Patient 3, Patient 5 and
Patient 6

The Respondent prescribed sedatives, benzodiazepines, muscle
relaxants and/or sleep aids to patients to whom she prescribed high
dosages of opioids The combination of these medications with opioid-
potentiating effects increases the risk for opioid-related adverse events
such as respiratory depression and death. Patient 1, Patient 2,
Patient 5 and Patient 6

Patient 2 and Patient 3 are a married couple who reside at the same
address. During their one-year course of treatment, the Respondent
massively increased each patient’s daily dosage of oxycodone to 200
mg in the absence of medical justification. The Respondent failed to
address red flags including: Patient 2’s report that one of her
prescriptions and identification had been stolen; and Patient 3’s reports
that he had exhausted his monthly allotment of medication and that he
had taken some of Patient 2’s OxyContin before the Respondent
began prescribing it to him. The Respondent increased each of the
patient's dosages without ordering additional urine drug testing to

ensure that they were complying with her prescribed regimen.
