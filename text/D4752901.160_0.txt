Dear Dr. Joseph, Mr. Morrow, and Ms. Kenyon:

On January 8, 2020, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl.
Vol. & 2019 Supp.).

Pursuant to the Order, on January 15, 2020, Disciplinary Panel A held a postdeprivation
hearing to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. Dr. Joseph and his counsel,
Thomas Morrow, Esq. attended the hearing on that date. The State was represented by Katherine
Vehar Kenyon, Assistant Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor. Both parties presented
oral arguments at the hearing.

After considering these arguments at the hearing and the investigative file, Disciplinary
Panel A determined that it would continue the summary suspension imposed on January 8, 2020.
Disciplinary Panel A thus will not lift the summary suspension order. Disciplinary Panel A finds
