After consideration of the parties’ presentations, Disciplinary Panel B determined, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the health, safety, and welfare of the public imperatively
required the disciplinary panel to summarily suspend Dr, Wiggins’s license and there exists a
substantial risk of serious harm to the public health, safety, and welfare in Dr. Wiggins’s
continued practice, Disciplinary Panel B thus will not lift the summary suspension order, and the
summary suspension imposed on February 14, 2022 is reaffirmed and continues in effect, See
COMAR 10,32.02.08H(1).
