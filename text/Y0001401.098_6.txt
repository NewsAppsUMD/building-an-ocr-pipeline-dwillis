terminated the Respondent's employment as a perfusionist for habitually being late and
making "mistakes" that could have endangered patient safety. The Board initiated an

“singled out" by her co-workers because she was being monitored by MPRP.

personnel file from the Facility. A review of the Respondent's personnel file showed the
following:
