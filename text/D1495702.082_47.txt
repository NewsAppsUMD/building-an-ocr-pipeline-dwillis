The Respondent failed to ever acknowledge wrongdoing or understanding that what he
did was unethical. He believed he could compartmentalize his personal from his professional.
‘He admitted that he did not keep up with the updates to regulations. And although his
misbehavior may have begun many years ago and gone unnoticed, most of the improprieties
continued throughout the last twenty years while COMAR 10.32.17, prohibiting sexual
misconduct with patients, was in existence.

The Board has provided substantial justification for its recommendation and the
appropriate sanction is revocation of licensure. Md. Code Ann., Health Oce, §. 14-404(a) (Supp.
2020), COMAR 10.32.02.09A, B(6); COMAR 10.32.02.10.

PROPOSED CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

 

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact and Discussion, I conclude as a matter of law
that the Respondent violated the alleged provisions of the law. Md. Code Ann., Health Occ.
§ 1-212; Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3)(ii), (11), and (13) (2014 and Supp. 2020),
COMAR 10.32.17.03. Asa result, I conclude that the Respondent is subject to disciplinary
sanction of revocation for the cited violations. Id., COMAR 10.32.02.09A, B(6).
