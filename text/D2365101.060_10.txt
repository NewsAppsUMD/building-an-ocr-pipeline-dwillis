The Respondent listened to the Patient’s heart with a stethoscope, and checked her
eyes and ears,

Then the Respondent had the Patient lie down to feel her lower abdominal area.

~ The Respondent, when performing a physical examination, normally felt the

Patient’s lower abdominal area for swelling or abnormalities,

The pants (leggings) the Patient was wearing were tight and high-waisted: In order
for the Respondent to reach her lower stomach area his hands had to be under her
waistline, He pushed on the area of the Patient’s lower stomach, and proceeded to
ask the Patient questions about a recent anxiety attack she experienced when she had
to appear before her field hockey team coaches. He began to lower his hand to the
upper part of her vagina, just above but not actually touching the clitoris, between
the labia majora and clitoris, For one or two minutes; which felt longer to the
Patient, his hand rubbed there.

The Patient was unable to answer the Respondent’s questions about her anxiety
because she was so distracted. The Respondent handed the Patient tissues, and she
tried to blow her nose, as she was crying. As she was lying down she could not
breathe, and leaned or sat up to blow her nose,

The Respondent stopped touching the Patient and gave her a hug once she sat up.
The Respondent continued conversing with the Patient, talking about her self-
esteem, and also about politics, a dream he had, and about an internal “judge.” He
said that patients with anxiety have a judge in their head like an inner voice. He _
asked the Patient which of her parents was her judge, who was always pushing her

to do better, She said it was her father,
