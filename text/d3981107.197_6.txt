The Board’s investigation revealed that Patient A was involved in a motor
vehicle accident on or about July 21, 2015 in which Patient A hit a motorcyclist.
Patient A was driving a vehicle that was later identified as belonging to [Dr.
Adams].

On January 22, 2016, a member of the Board’s staff interviewed Physician
A, the owner of Practice A. According to Physician A, she confronted [Dr.
Adams] regarding Patient B’s allegations. [Dr. Adams] denied the allegations,
however, [Dr. Adams] later admitted to giving Patient A money for food, cash
and suboxone’ and to having knowledge that Patient A was a drug addict. Further,
according to Physician A [Dr. Adams] also admitted to her that he took Patient A
to Florida to celebrate Patient A’s sobriety and that Patient A lived with [Dr.
Adams] for a period of time. The Board’s investigation further revealed that [Dr.
Adams] prescribed CDS to Patient A on multiple dates when Patient A did not
have an appointment.

On April 19, 2016, a member of the Board’s staff interviewed Patient B.
According to Patient B, she had an appointment with [Dr. Adams] on or about
August 29, 2015. At the appointment, [Dr. Adams] stated that he could no longer
be her doctor and left the room without examining her. Patient B stated that she
returned to Practice A to see [Dr. Adams] on September 2, 2015, after her
appointment with pain management. [Dr. Adamis] refused to see Patient B and
discharged her from his practice. While outside in the parking lot, Patient B
recognized [Dr. Adams]’s car (it was parked in a space labeled with [Dr.
Adams]’s name) as a car that her son, Patient A, drove on previous occasions.
According to Patient B, she realized that [Dr. Adams] was Patient A’s “friend”
who took Patient A to Florida and who wrote prescriptions for Patient A. Patient
B stated that she immediately spoke with Witness B and reported what she knew
about the relationship between Patient A and [Dr. Adams]. Patient B believed that
[Dr. Adams] discharged her from his practice when [Dr. Adams] realized that she
was Patient A’s mother.

A review of [Dr. Adams]’s personnel file from Practice A revealed an
incident note from June 25, 2015 which documented [Dr. Adams]’s attempt to
hire Patient A without informing management. Physician A documented that she
advised [Dr. Adams] that all hiring must be done through management and that
Patient A would not be hired due to his criminal background. On or about
September 7, 2015, Practice A terminated [Dr. Adams].

[Dr. Adams]’s conduct, as set forth above, constitutes a violation of one or
more of the following provisions of the Act: H.O. §§ 14-404(3) Is guilty of: (ii)
Unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine; and/or (33) Fails to cooperate
with a lawful investigation conducted by the Board or a disciplinary panel.
