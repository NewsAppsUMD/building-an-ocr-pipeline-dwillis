ORDER AFTER SHOW CAUSE HEARING

On May 9, 2019, Jesus A. Burbano, M.D. and Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State
Board of Physicians (“Panel A”) entered into a Consent Order wherein Dr. Burbano’s license to
practice medicine was suspended for a minimum of one year and Dr. Burbano agreed to enroll in
the Maryland Professional Rehabilitation Program (“MPRP”) and comply with all of MPRP’s
requirements and recommendations (attached as Exhibit 1). On November 1, 2019, Panel A
issued a Violation of Consent Order and Notice to Show Cause, charging Dr. Burbano with
violating condition 1 of the May 9, 2019 Consent Order, which required Dr. Burbano to comply
with requirements of MPRP. On December 4, 2019, Panel A held a show cause hearing where
Dr. Burbano had the opportunity to argue why his license should not be subject to further
discipline.

FINDINGS OF FACT

Background

The Board received a complaint, dated June 15, 2018, from a physician assistant
(“Complainant”) who worked at an urgent care center.’ The Complainant reported that Dr.
Burbano entered the urgent care center and acted in a manner, which caused the complainant to
believe that Dr. Burbano might have been “under the influence.” The Board opened an

investigation, which included referring Dr. Burbano for an evaluation pursuant to Health

"In order to protect confidentiality, the name of the Complainant, health care facilities or Board-approved Programs
will not be disclosed in this document.
