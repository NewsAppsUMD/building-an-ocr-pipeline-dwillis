2 (Sex Offense-Fourth Degree) and sentenced Dr. Torres to the maximum sentence of one-
year incarceration.

5. On January 16, 2020, Dr. Torres filed a Notice of Appeal of the case to the Maryland Court
of Special Appeals. As of the date of this Order, Dr. Torres’s appeal is still pending before
the Court of Special Appeals.

DISCUSSION

Pursuant to COMAR 10.32.02.07E(2), Dr. Torres has the opportunity to respond to the
order to show cause, in writing, to address the following limited issues: “(a) Lack of conviction or
plea; (b) Whether the crime is one involving moral turpitude; (c) Misidentity of the respondent
with the defendant in the criminal matter; and (d) Other relevant issues, if any, other than
mitigation.” Dr. Torres does not deny that he was convicted of fourth-degree sex offense and
second-degree assault. Nor does he argue that he was misidentified as the defendant in the criminal
case. Rather, Dr. Torres argues that (1) the petition to suspend and the hearing should be stayed
pending the outcome of his commitment to MDH and pending the outcome of the decision of the

Court of Special Appeals; and (2) the crimes he pled guilty to are not crimes involving moral

turpitude.

Request for a Hearing and Stay of the Proceedings
Pursuant to COMAR 10.32.02.07E(3), Dr. Torres may request to address the disciplinary

panel by a limited evidentiary hearing, but the argument is not as of right, but is discretionary

based on the existence of genuine issues of material fact or law as determined by the disciplinary
panel. Dr. Torres requested a hearing on the petition but asked for the hearing to be stayed pending
his commitment to MDH and pending the outcome of his appeal. The Panel, in its discretion,
denied Dr. Torres’s request for a hearing and denied the request to stay the proceedings in this

matter.
