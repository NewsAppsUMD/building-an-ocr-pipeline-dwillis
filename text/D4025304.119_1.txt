a written request for a hearing within TEN (10) days of the date of this letter. Any request for a
hearing should be sent to Christine A. Farrelly, Executive Director, at the Board’s address. If
such a hearing is requested, the regulations require that an Administrative Law J udge set the
hearing to begin within 30 days of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08 I, though that 30-day
requirement may be waived.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel A resulting from
formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.

Sincerely yours,

Maryland State Board of Physicians
