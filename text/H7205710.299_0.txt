CONSENT ORDER
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

The Maryland Board of Physicians (the “Maryland Board”) received information
that Vinson DiSanto, DO, (the “Respondent”) License Number H72057, was disciplined
by the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure (the “Kentucky Board”). In an Order dated
March 19, 2019, the Kentucky Board restricted the Respondent from prescribing,
dispensing, or professionally utilizing controlled substances.

Based on the above referenced Kentucky Board sanction, the Maryland Board has
grounds to charge the Respondent with violating the following provisions of the
Maryland Medical Practice Act (the “Act”), under H. O. § 14-404(a):

(a) Subject to the hearing provisions of § 14-405 of this subtitle, a

disciplinary panel, on the affirmative vote of a majority of the quorum
of the disciplinary panel, may reprimand any licensee, place any
licensee on probation, or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee:
(21) Is disciplined by a licensing or disciplinary

authority or convicted or disciplined by a court of

any state or country or disciplined by any branch of

the United States uniformed services or the

Veteran’s Administration for an act that would be

grounds for disciplinary action under this section,

The Maryland Board has determined that the acts for which the Respondent was

disciplined by the Kentucky Board would be grounds for disciplinary action under H.O. §
