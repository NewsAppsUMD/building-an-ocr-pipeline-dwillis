FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On November 15, 2016, Charles J.N. Akoda, M.D., a physician licensed! by the
Maryland State Board of Physicians (“Board”), entered a plea of guilty to one count of Social
Security Account Number Fraud in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland
(U.S. District Court”), in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 408(a)(7)(B). (Case No. PWG-8-16-CR-
00277-001). On March 2, 2017, Dr. Akoda was sentenced to six months incarceration, three
years of supervised release, home detention for six months, and an assessment of $100.00. Dr.
Akoda has not filed an appeal of his conviction and the time for filing an appeal has passed.

On April 4, 2017, the Office of the Attorney General filed with the Board a Petition to
Revoke Dr. Akoda’s license to practice medicine, pursuant to section 14-404(b)(2) of the Health
Occupations Article, which provides:

After completion of the appellate process if the conviction has not been reversed

or the plea has not been set aside with respect to a crime involving moral

turpitude, a disciplinary panel shall order the revocation of a license on the
certification by the Office of the Attorney General.

' Dr. Akoda allowed his license to expire on September 30, 2016. The Board was notified of Dr. Akoda’s criminal
indictment in August of 2016 and began its investigation prior to the expiration of Dr. Akoda’s license. Pursuant to
Section 14-403 of the Health Occupations Article, the license of an individual regulated by the Board “may [not]
lapse by operation of law while the individual is under investigation . . .’ Md. Code. Ann., Health Occ. § 14-403(a)
(2014 Repl. Vol.). Therefore, by operation of law, Dr. Akoda’s license was not permitted to expire during the
pendency of these proceedings.
