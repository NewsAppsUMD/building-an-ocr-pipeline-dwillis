ORDER OF DEFAULT
BACKGROUND

On April 21, 2016, a disciplinary panel of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
(“Board”) charged Jerry P. Adams, M.D. with unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine
and failure to cooperate with a lawful investigation conducted by the Board or a disciplinary
panel. See Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. (“Health Occ.”) § 14-404(a)(3)Gi) and (33). On
September 2, 2016, based on further investigation, amended charges were issued. The amended
charges alleged that Dr. Adams overprescribed controlled dangerous substances to a patient and
engaged in an inappropriate relationship with that patient and that he failed to cooperate with the
Board’s investigation. The Amended Charges were also brought pursuant to Health Occ. § 14-
404(a)(3)Gi) and (33). On November 10, 2016, the Board referred the case to the Office of

Administrative Hearings (“OAH”) for an evidentiary hearing.
After notice was sent to Dr. Adams and the State, at their respective addresses of record,
a scheduling conference was held at OAH in Hunt Valley, Maryland on December 5, 2016, at
9:30 a.m.' Dr. Adams did not appear for the scheduling conference and no one appeared on his

behalf. The administrative prosecutor appeared on behalf of the State. After waiting more than

' The notice for the scheduling conference was mailed to two addresses that the Board had on record for Dr. Adams,
One address was in Hyndman, Pennsylvania and the other address was in Cumberland, Maryland. The notice sent to
the Maryland address was returned to OAH as “not deliverable as addressed.” The notice sent to the Pennsylvania
address was not returned.
