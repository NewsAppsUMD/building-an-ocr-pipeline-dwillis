License No.: D40253

Dear Dr. Quon and Counsel:

On March 26, 2019, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2)G@) (2014 Repl.
Vol. & 2018 Supp.). Dr. Quon was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing
before Disciplinary Panel A to show cause why that suspension should not be continued on April
10, 2019. Dr. Quon did not attend the hearing, but he was represented by counsel, Kenneth
West. The State was represented by Christopher Anderson, Administrative Prosecutor. At the
hearing, Mr. West, on behalf of Dr. Quon, stated that Dr. Quon consented to the summary
suspension, and therefore, neither party presented any arguments in opposition to the
continuance of the summary suspension.

After considering the presentations of the parties at the hearing and the investigative file,
Disciplinary Panel A determined that it would continue the summary suspension imposed on
March 26, 2019. The order of summary suspension is thus reaffirmed and will continue.
COMAR 10.32.02.08H(1). Disciplinary Panel A, through its counsel, advised the parties of this
decision orally on the hearing date.

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board’s regulations, Dr. Quon has the right to request a full evidentiary
hearing before an Administrative Law Judge. This request will be granted if the Board receives
