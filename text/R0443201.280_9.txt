following physician orders.

20. The Respondent’s file also states that multiple staff members expressed
concerns about the Respondent’s unprofessional workplace behavior. Staff variously
described the Respondent as “a loose cannon,” “intimidating,” “creepy,” “vindictive” and
a “bully.” Staff reported that they were fearful to report their concerns about the
Respondent out of fear of retaliation. One staff member reported witnessing the
Respondent send sexual text messages to women and asking for pictures of their breasts.

21. Board staff interviewed the Respondent’s supervisor, who stated that his
workplace relationship with the Respondent became “very contentious.” The supervisor
stated that Facility B had investigated the Respondent for failing to report that he had x-
rayed the wrong body part and placing the images under the incorrect patient. The
supervisor counseled the Respondent numerous times about Facility B’s protocol and it
came to a point when he did not feel comfortable meeting with the Respondent alone due
to the Respondent’s acting erratically and aggressively during such meetings. The
supervisor stated that multiple staff members complained that the Respondent went
missing for hours during his shift and staff was not able to contact him. In addition, the
supervisor stated that staff reported to him that the Respondent made them feel
“uncomfortable” and described him as “creepy” and “touchy-feely.” Staff reported that
they were afraid to report.their concerns out of fear that the Respondent would retaliate

against them.
