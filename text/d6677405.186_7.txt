On August 18, 2014, Patient 2 was escorted to an examination room and was
told to wait for the Respondent. Patient 2 remained in her street clothes.

A female chaperone was not present during the Respondent's examination of
Patient 2.

Patient 2 told the Respondent that she was in a lot of pain and asked if it was
possible that she had fractured her spine as a result of a fall in December 2013.
The Respondent documented in Patient 2’s medical record that he performed a
number of musculoskeletal tests on Patient 2 involving manipulation of her head
and neck as well as her legs. The Respondent further documented that Patient 2
had pain on palpation at the lumbar facet joints.

At one point during the Respondent’s examination, he stood behind Patient 2 and
“touched [her] spine from the top to the bottom,” while asking if she experienced
any pain.

The Respondent asked her to pull her pants down. When she complied, the
Respondent, who was not wearing gloves, touched the area of Patient 2’s coccyx
and then moved to her anus.

The Respondent stopped to put on a glove and then inserted his finger in Patient
2’s anus, asking her if she felt any pain.

The Respondent then instructed Patient 2 to pull up her pants and told her that it
was unlikely that she had fractured her spine. The Respondent told Patient 2
that if she had fractured any bones in her lower spine, the fracture would have

healed with the passage of time.
