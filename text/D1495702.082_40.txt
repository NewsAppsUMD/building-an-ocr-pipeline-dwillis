Code of Medical Ethics Opinion 9.1. discusses the concerns of a relationship with a

former patient:

A physician must terminate the patient-physician relationship before initiating a
dating, romantic, or sexual relationship with a patient.

Likewise, sexual or romantic relationships between a physician and a former
patient may be unduly influenced by the previous physician-patient relationship.
Sexual or romantic relationships with former patients are unethical if the
physician uses or exploits trust, knowledge, emotions, or influence derived from

the previously professional relationship, or if a romantic relationship would
otherwise foreseeably harm. the individual.

(Bd. Ex. 12.)

Dr. Bhestities that based on Patient B’s history of depression, PTSD, and spousal
abuse, all of which were known to the Respondent, coupled with the cultivation of a relationship
surrounding a mutual interest in art beginning early in the doctor-patient relationship, the
Respondent exploited the trust, knowledge, and cmotions of Patient B that all developed from the
doctor-patient relationship. Dr. aso opined that harm was foresceable because of Patient
B’s mental health concerns and volatile home situation.

De, | ie that Patient B’s records provide no indication that in June 2005 Patient B
was cured (as suggested by the Respondent), or that the physician-patient relationship
terminated. The Respondent did not provide a termination letter, did not refer Patient B to
another provider, did not send a final letter to her primary care physician, and admitted to
continuing to treat ber with prescriptions after that time.

Even if I were to accept that Patient B became a “former patient” in June 2005, the
initiation of a sexual relationship within three months of that time, afler treating Patient B for
seven years, should have been recognized by the Respondent as inappropriate and foreseeably

harmful to Patient B based on her social-emotional history.
