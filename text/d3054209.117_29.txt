 

complainants feel as though they received justice for their mistreatment by the Respondent. As
the State noted, “If the Board does not take strong action to ferret out unprofessional conduct, the
public will be dispirited. It will think that its public bodies that regulate the profession aren’t
addressing serious situations in a serious way.” (Tr., p. 443 )

I am mindful-that the Respondent successfully completed the terms of probation
associated with the previous disciplinary order of the Board. I am further mindful that the
Respondent has a thriving private practice and a substantial voluntary practice, which have a

‘significant combined patient population served by the Respondent. I believe the Respondent to
be a dedicated physician who derives meaningful personal and professional satisfaction from
working with his patients. I am, however, troubled by the Respondent’s inability to see how
truly inappropriate his conduct was towards $.W. and 8.B. Although he conceded that after
hearing S.W. testify he came to understand her better, it was clear from his testimonial
responses, as well as his responses to the Board’s investigative inquiries, that he saw nothing
amiss in his attempt to “vet” her about her religious beliefs and to counsel her about the laws of
- the United States. He failed to see how his behavior directly contributed to her assessment of

_ him as unprofessional, and he had no insight into the complete inappropriateness of interfering
with her control and custody of her client. Patient A was in no danger from S.W.; there was
simply no good reason for the Respondent to lock Patient A out of S.W.’s reach and sight on,
December 5, 2015. Although the Respondent acknowledged he could have handled himself
better on that date, he did not seem to understand the particulars of his errors in decorum,

judgment and professionalism.
