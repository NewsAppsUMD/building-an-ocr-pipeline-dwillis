The case was well-presented by both sides. The issues regarding alleged immoral and
unprofessional conduct largely involve a credibility determination. As addressed above, neither ’
M.P.D. nor MS.A.0. had an incentive to falsify their allegations, remained consistent in their
recollection of what occurred, did not embellish their experience and, in the case of M.P.D.,
provided testimony in a manner that evoked trustworthiness. For these reasons, J find that their
allegations were credible. During a breast exam, the Respondent spoke to M.P.D. in Spanish and
told her that her breasts were large, and that her husband must have been very happy with her
breasts. During a breast exam, the Respondent spoke to M.S.A.O. in Spanish and told her that
she had the breasts of a fifteen-year old,

The Respondent raised a concern that both M.P.D. and M.S.A.O. knew Ms. [aim
outside of the program because they all attended the same church. The Respondent
bolstered this argument by alleging that it was too coincidental that the two allegations came
within days of one another, and a year or more after the alleged incident occurred. M.P. D.
testified that while she knew which church Ms. Ee attended, they did not attend the si same
chutch. (Transcript Vol. I, pg. 65). The Record does not include any evidence of collusion
between M.P.D., M. S.A. 0. and Ms. | or what incentive the three of them would have
fo create the allegations against the Respondent. The timing of both of the reports a 1 yeat or more
after the alleged incident is explained by the fact that both allegations were in response to Ms.

Ezz calls to schedule the patient’s annual appointments. The fact that the two were in
close proximity could be a coincidence, or it could underscore why the statements stood out to
Ms. nd prompted her to make the report to the _ Regardless, there is no proof

or evidence in the Record that the patients’ allegations were anything other than truthful.
