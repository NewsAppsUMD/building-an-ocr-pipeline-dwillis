within 9 months.

The peer review conducted in 2001 identified standard of care deficiencies that included
prescribing multiple CDS and opioid analgesics in the absence of documentation to support the

Baltatzis’s failure to document complete history and physical examinations, order basic
laboratory studies, conduct routine cancer screening, or record rectal or pelvic examinations.

In 2003, the Board referred the patient medical records to two peer reviewers who
concluded that Dr, Baltatzis deviated from standards of quality care and documentation because

prostate screening, mammograms and Pap smears for patients over 50 years old. The reviewers
also concluded that he failed to order laboratory studies consistently to monitor for possible side
effects of medications he prescribed. In addition, they found that he failed to document past
medical or family history, failed to document patient complaints in adequate detail, failed to
consistently document a current medication list, medication allergies or significant side effects,
and failed to document his clinical thought processes or approaches to the treatment of patients’
presenting complaints.
