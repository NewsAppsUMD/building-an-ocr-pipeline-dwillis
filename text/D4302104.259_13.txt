During the course of CRNA Three’s tenure at the Facility, she
received about four-to-five complaints about the Respondent’s
bullying behavior toward female staff persons.

Female staff persons reported to her that the Respondent’s behavior
“created a very uncomfortable work situation.”

When confronted with these complaints, the Respondent did not admit
to any wrongdoing. The Respondent said “[t]hat’s their problem. They

can come to talk to me if there’s an issue.”

22. During her interview, CRNA Four stated:

a.

The Respondent’s behavior caused the female nurses to feel
intimidated and bullied. He was “very, very demeaning to the nurses.”
The Respondent would raise his voice and say, “with this snappish
style ... just do your job.”

CRNA Four switched from full-time to part-time work at the Facility
in part because of the Respondent’s behavior.

The Respondent’s behavior “decreased morale.” It made the nurses
“very paranoid” and kept the staff from collaborating “as effectively

as they should.”

23. During her interview, CRNA Five stated:

a.

The Respondent is “very short” with people and “talks over” female
nurses in the pre-op area. He “just comes in and pushes them out of

the way.”
