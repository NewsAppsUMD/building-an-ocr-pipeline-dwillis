 

The ALJ mailed copies of the Proposed Default Order to Mr. Lee, the administrative
prosecutor, and the Board at the parties’ respective addresses of record. The Proposed Default
Order notified the parties that they may file written exceptions to the proposed order but must do
so within 15 days of the date of the Proposed Default Order. The Proposed Default Order stated
that any exceptions and request for a hearing must be sent to the Board with a copy provided to

Disciplinary Panel B (“Panel B”) of the Board for final disposition.

FINDINGS OF FACT

Because Panel B concludes that Mr. Lee has defaulted and has not filed exceptions to the

2. On or about May 29, 2018, Mr. Lee submitted an online renewal application using the
Board’s online renewal application process.

3. When a licensee completed the online application renewal process, he must check a
box stating that he has completed a Criminal History Record Check (“CHRC”) prior to
completing the online application renewal process. The licensee acknowledges in the
application that ifhe fails to complete the CHRC, he or she will face disciplinary action.

4. Prior to proceeding with the application, a pop-up screen appears that informs the
licensee that the Board may not renew a license if the Board has not received the
licensee’s CHRC information, which includes the licensee’s submission of the

licensee’s fingerprints to the Criminal Justice Information Services (“CJIS”) before
