On September 20, 2021, the ALJ issued a Proposed Default Order. The ALJ found that
Mr. Muller had proper notice of the September 9, 2021 prehearing conference and that he failed

the statements set out in the allegations of fact section of the charging document, conclude as a
matter of law that Mr. Muller violated Health Occ. §§. 14-5B-14(a)(3), (4), and (26) in the
manner set forth in the charges, and recommended as a sanction that Mr. Muller’s license be
revoked.

On September 24, 2021, the ALJ mailed copies of the Proposed Default Order to Mr.
Muller, the administrative prosecutor, and the Board at the parties’ respective addresses of
record. The Proposed Default Order notified the parties that they may file written exceptions to
the proposed order but must do so within 15 days of the date of the Proposed Default Order. The
Proposed Default Order stated that any exceptions and request for a hearing must be sent to the
Board with attention to the Board’s Executive Director. Mr. Muller did not file exceptions. On
November 17, 2021, this case came before Disciplinary Panel B (“Panel B”) of the Board for
final disposition.
