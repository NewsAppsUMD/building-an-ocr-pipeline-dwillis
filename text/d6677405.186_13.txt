The Respondent was provided a copy of Patient 4’s complaint. By letter dated
April 23, 2016, the Respondent stated that he did not recall the patient without
reviewing his notes, but “vehemently denfied]...that the buttock (sic) were spread
apart for the procedure.” The Respondent further stated that cervical epidural
steroid injections are performed under fluoroscopy which requires the
participation of an x-ray technician and one nurse, “which explains why a nurse
was present for the cervical injection described by [Patient 4].”

Patient 5 — Case # 2016-0830B

Patient 5, a female in her 50s with a history of chronic lumbar disc displacement
and severe lower back pain, initially presented to the Respondent in 2013.
Patient 5 had requested to be treated by the Respondent because he had treated
her husband for several years and she trusted him.

On or about November 27, 2013, Patient 5 presented for an office visit with the
Respondent. Previous visits with the Respondent had been uneventful.

At the November 27, 2013 visit, the Respondent asked Patient 5 about her pain
and whether his previous treatments had helped decrease her pain. The
Respondent then examined her.

At the beginning of the examination, the Respondent instructed Patient 5 to lie
face-down on the examining table.

The Respondent instructed Patient 5 to pull down her pants. Patient 5 complied,
pulling her pants down to the middle of her thigh and her underwear down to the

top of her intergluteal cleft.
