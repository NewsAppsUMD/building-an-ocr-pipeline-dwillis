the lack of a pain management contract and the consideration of the contract now has no impact
on the Panel’s standard of care determination.

After considering the additional records, Panel B agrees with the ALJ’s and Dr. Wright’s
determinations that the standard of quality care was not met with respect to Patient F. The
contents of the additional documents were largely discussed in other notes, the original patient

additional documents did not change the fact that Dr. Dooley failed to order any urine drug
screens for almost two years, provided Patient F with early prescription refills, and did not
transition Patient F to a long acting opioid medication even though his pain was chronic and
lasted over three months. The additional documents also do not change the fact that Dr. Dooley
never verified with the pharmacy that they dispensed 20 Percocet pills less than prescribed and
never asked Patient F for any documentation of the shortage before writing a prescription for an
additional 20 pills. The additional documents have no impact on the ALJ’s proposed findings
concerning the standard of care.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Based on the foregoing factual findings, Panel B concludes that Dr. Dooley failed to meet
the appropriate standards as determined by appropriate peer review for the delivery of quality
medical care concerning his treatment of Patients A-J, in violation of Health Occ. § 14-
404(a)(22).

SANCTION

Dr. Dooley excepts to the ALJ’s proposed sanction of a one-year suspension and three

restrict him from practicing pain medicine and prescribing opioids to patients except in
