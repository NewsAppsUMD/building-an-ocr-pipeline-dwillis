Case No.: 7723-0087B
License No.: D87861

Dear Dr. Grumbine and Counsel:

On October 17, 2023, Disciplinary Panel B of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 10-226(c)(2). Dr. Grumbine
was given an opportunity to attend a post-deprivation hearing on November 15, 2023, before
Disciplinary Panel B, to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. Prior to the
scheduled hearing, Dr. Grumbine’s counsel contacted the Board and stated that Dr. Grumbine
waived her right to the post-deprivation hearing. Due to the waiver, Panel B did not hold a post-
deprivation hearing in this matter, the summary suspension continues, and the parties may proceed
to the summary suspension appeal if Dr. Grumbine requests an evidentiary hearing as referenced
below. COMAR 10.32.02.08E.

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board’s regulations, Dr. Grumbine has the right to request a full evidentiary
hearing before an Administrative Law Judge. This request will be granted if the Board receives a
written request for a hearing within TEN (10) days of the date of this letter. Any request for a
hearing should be sent to Christine A. Farrelly, Executive Director, at the Board’s address. If such
