John Vitarello Jr., M.D.
License No. D27544, Case No. 2220-0243
Page 2 of 2

On December 29, 2020, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann.,
State Gov’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2019 Supp.).

Pursuant to the Order, on January 13, 2021, Disciplinary Panel A held a postdeprivation hearing
to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. Dr. Vitarello, and his counsel, Ms.
Witherup and Ms. Wesker attended the hearing on that date. The State was represented by
Katherine Vehar-Kenyon, Assistant Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor. Both parties
presented oral arguments at the hearing.

After considering these arguments at the hearing and documents in the investigative file,
Disciplinary Panel A determined that it would continue the summary suspension imposed on
December 29, 2020. Disciplinary Panel A thus will not lift the summary suspension order,
Disciplinary Panel A finds that the public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires the
suspension of Dr. Vitarello’s license, See State Gov’t, § 10-226(c)(2)(i). The order of summary
suspension is thus reaffirmed and continues. See COMAR 10.32.02.08H(1).

NOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL

Under the Board regulations, Dr. Vitarello has the right to request a full evidentiary
hearing before an Administrative Law Judge at the Office of Administrative Hearings. To
receive the evidentiary hearing, Dr. Vitarello or his counsel must file the request for the hearing
within TEN (10) days of the date of this letter. The request for a hearing should be sent to
Christine Farrelly, Executive Director, at the Board’s address. If the hearing is timely requested,
the regulations require that an Administrative Law Judge set the hearing to begin within 30 days
of the request, see COMAR 10.32.02.08I, though that 30-day time period may be waived.

This letter constitutes an order of the Board through Disciplinary Panel A resulting from

formal disciplinary action and is therefore a public document.
