Dear Dr. Tong, Mr. Costello, and Ms. Pepper:

On November 18, 2020, Disciplinary Panel A of the Maryland State Board of Physicians
issued an ORDER FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION in this case, pursuant to Md. Code Ann.,
State Gov't, § 10-226(c)(2)(i) (2014 Repl. Vol. & 2019 Supp.).

Pursuant to the Order, on January 13, 2021, Disciplinary Panel A held a postdeprivation
hearing to show cause why that suspension should not be continued. Dr. Tong, and his counsel,
Daniel C. Costello, Esq. attended the hearing on that date. The State was represented by Victoria
Pepper, Assistant Attorney General, Administrative Prosecutor. Both parties presented oral
arguments at the hearing.

After considering these arguments at the hearing and the investigative file, Disciplinary
Panel A determined that it would continue the summary suspension imposed on November 18,
2020. Disciplinary Panel A thus will not lift the summary suspension order. Disciplinary Panel A
finds that the public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires the suspension of Dr. Tong’s
