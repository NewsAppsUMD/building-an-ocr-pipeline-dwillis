An investigation into the licensee’s practices in the Commonwealth of Kentucky via
telemedicine and a KASPER review disclosed four (4) patients having received controlled
substance prescriptions from the licensee in Kentucky.

The licensee produced three (3) patient charts in response to a Board subpoena for the four
(4) patient charts. The licensee denied that he treated the fourth patient (“Patient BA”) or
had a chart on Patient BA.

A copy of the prescription to Patient BA was obtained and showed that it was written under
the licensee’s name, with a New Jersey address. Patient BA’s address was listed as being
in Utah, but the prescription was delivered to a UPS store in Murray, Kentucky.

A Board consultant reviewed the three (3) patient charts produced by the licensee and
opined that the licensee failed to conform to acceptable and prevailing medical practices in
the Commonwealth of Kentucky and, in one instance, demonstrated gross negligence by
prescribing controlled substances without medical necessity.

On or about February 11 2018, the licensee responded that he had made a number of
changes in his practice, including that he decreased overprescribed medications to one
patient and made personnel changes, The licensee stated, in part, that “when compliance
issues became apparent to me, I discontinued care to the patients and have since made
personnel changes which has repaired this flaw. Kentucky was never planned as an area
of focus for Anti-Aging Medicine, and this activity has been discontinued since 2016.”
Upon this information, the Board consultant opined that until his current practices can be

evaluated, his prescribing be monitored if he maintains an active Kentucky medical license.
