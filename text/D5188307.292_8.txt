ethical standards between Egypt, where Dr. Mikhail trained, and the United States. His actions
were done knowingly, willingly, voluntarily, and deceptively.

Based on his intentional writing of false prescriptions, Dr. Mikhail’s arguments fall apart.
His claim that he deserves a lesser sanction because of his “unknowing violation” and his being
unaware “of the ethical prohibition here” are fully focused on his prescribing to family members
and he simply ignores the alarming willful violation regarding false prescriptions for Family
Member 2. Dr. Mikhail acknowledges that he knew that was not acceptable behavior to write
those false prescriptions, and yet he did it anyway. Based on its mandate of public protection, the
Panel believes that a meaningful sanction must reflect the serious nature of the false prescriptions
written by Dr. Mikhail. The Panel will impose a suspension for one week to impress upon Dr.
Mikhail that writing false prescriptions will not be tolerated. Ultimately, the Panel agrees with
the ALJ’s assessment that Dr. Mikhail has rehabilitative potential, and the short duration of the
suspension reflects the Panel’s intention to give Dr. Mikhail a second chance.

The Panel, thus, rejects Dr. Mikhail’s arguments regarding imposing a suspension and
will also impose a reprimand. The Panel accepts the ALJ’s recommended sanction in part; and
accepts the ALJ’s recommended two-year probationary period, recordkeeping course, ethics
course, and fine. The Panel modifies the ALJ’s recommended sanction, in part, and imposes a
suspension of five business days and imposes a reprimand.
