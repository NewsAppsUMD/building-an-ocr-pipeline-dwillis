attached CDS report for October 2013 listing multiple CDS that had been prescribed by the Respondent
for patients on October 18 through 31, 2013, and the Medical Director wrote: “Please note the attached
report from the last two weeks. Hopefully, these are for the most part, bridge scripts to get these patients
to pain management. | will run this report monthly.”
