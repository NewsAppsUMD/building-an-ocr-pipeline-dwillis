12, On November 1, 2018, the Board issued a subpoena to the Respondent to
appear for an interview at the Board's offices. On November 19, 2018, the Respondent,
accompanied by counsel, appeared at the Board for an under-oath interview. During the
interview, Board staff attempted to question the Respondent about the above complaint
and her practices at Facility C, at which point the Respondent’s counsel informed Board
staff that there was an ongoing federal investigation pending against Facility C, and that
the Respondent would be invoking her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination
under the United States Constitution and would not be answering any questions regarding
those subject areas. The Respondent further invoked her right against self-incrimination
to questions regarding: the allegation in the complaint that her “prescription pattern is
unethical, and her patient/Dr. relationships are unusual”; prescribing to family members;
prescribing medications to patients to include querying the Prescription Drug Monitoring
Program to monitor compliance while at Facility C; the basis for her decision to leave
employment at Facility C; and the charges pending against her in the United States
District Court for the District of Maryland. Board staff also questioned the Respondent
regarding the information voluntarily disclosed by the Respondent’s counsel to Board
staff on September 7 and September 27, 2018. The Respondent’s counsel refused to
permit the Respondent to answer such questions, citing “medical privilege” and his
assertion that the Board had no right to “get into her health status,” which he claimed

“was not an issue.”
