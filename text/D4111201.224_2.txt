On October 27, 2023, the ALJ issued a Corrected Proposed Default Order.! The ALJ found
that Dr. Newbold had proper notice of the October 5, 2023 video prehearing conference and that
he failed to appear or participate. The ALJ proposed that the Panel find Dr. Newbold in default,
adopt as findings of fact the statements set out in the allegations of fact section of the charges, and
conclude as a matter of law that Dr. Newbold violated Health Occ. § 14-404(a)(3){ii) and 14-
404(a)(13). As a sanction, the ALJ proposed that Dr. Newbold’s license to practice medicine in
Maryland be revoked.

The ALJ mailed copies of the Corrected Proposed Default Order to Dr. Newbold, the
administrative prosecutor, and the Board at the parties’ respective addresses of record. The
Corrected Proposed Default Order notified the parties that they may file written exceptions to the
proposed order but must do so within 15 days of the date of the Corrected Proposed Default Order.
The Corrected Proposed Default Order stated that any exceptions and requests for a hearing must
be sent to the Board with a copy provided to the opposing party. Neither party filed exceptions.
On December 20, 2023, this case came before Disciplinary Panel B (“Panel B”) of the Board for
final disposition.

FINDINGS OF FACT

Because Panel B concludes that Dr. Newbold has defaulted and has not filed exceptions to
the ALJ’s Proposed Default Order, the following findings of fact are adopted from the allegations
of fact in the March 9, 2023 charges and are deemed proven by the preponderance of the evidence:

1, The Respondent was licensed to practice medicine in the State of Maryland.
The Respondent was originally licensed to practice medicine in Maryland on

' The Corrected Proposed Default Order was issued to include the notice of the right to file exceptions, which was not
included on the initial Proposed Default Order issued on October 11, 2023.
