ordered the Respondent to undergo a complete, comprehensive, multi-day, independent
evaluation with a specialist in behavioral issues and unprofessional conduct. The
Respondent completed the evaluation on July 29, 2022.

prior incidents and showed evidence of a “profound lack of understanding about his
behavior and sexual boundary violations.” The evaluation did not endorse the
Respondent’s practice of medicine and recommended that he should enter an in-patient
program for a more in-depth assessment of his professional boundary violations.”

evaluation and directed him to enroll in one of three MPRP-approved treatment programs
no later than September 16, 2022.

seek treatment at a non MPRP-approved facility, in non-compliance with MPRP’s
directive.

one of the MPRP-approved programs by September 26, 2022, in order to continue his
