extensive period of time.” The Physician has been supervising the Respondent pursuant to
a Delegation Agreement since 2018.2

16. The Delegation Agreement identified the Physician’s primary practice areas
as urology and internal medicine. The Physician admitted that his primary practice area is
emergency medicine, and that the Delegation Agreement was “errantly marked” by
someone other than himself. The Physician also stated in the Delegation Agreement that
he would review the Respondent’s practice via “chart review, observation of clinical
practice” and provide supervision via on site, electronic means and written instructions.
The Physician admitted that he never provided written instructions to the Respondent. The
Physician stated that he occasionally talked to the Respondent on the telephone. The
Physician stated he initially provided “chart review, and now that’s predominantly verbal
conversation regarding patients who present issues.” The Physician testified he looks at
charts by the Respondent “only infrequently, if there is a specific issue with them.”

17. In the Delegation Agreement, the Physician and the Respondent did not seek
approval from the Board for the Respondent to treat priapism. Additionally, the Physician
and the Respondent did not seek approval from the Board for the Respondent to delegate
treatment of priapism to medical assistants. Despite this, the Respondent treats priapism
with phenylephrine injections without seeking permission from the Physician or having

been approved to do so by the Board.
